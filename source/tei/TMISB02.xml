<ab>BY OREN ARNOLD.</ab>
<p>TOMBSTONE, ARIZ., once the "livest" city between the Mississippi and the Pacific, is planning to live again.</p>
<p>Its citizenship, now dwindled to about 1,500, is preparing to revive for a week that extremely colorful period&#8212;around 1881&#8212;when every-day life was a hullabaloo of what we now call the wild west. When the noise recedes and the gun smoke clears away, the world at large will know emphatically that Tombstone is 50 years old. For it is to be a birthday celebration.</p>
<p>For a week the present will fade and the past reappear like a picture. Tombstone's streets will see lumber wagons coming in from the Chiricahua mountains; will clank and clatter with the noise of ore trains and mule skinners, of whips and pistols.</p>
<p>Arcaded sidewalks again will be crowded. Roistering throngs will be heard in laughter from brilliantly lighted bars, laughter measured by the click of faro and the rattle of roulette wheels.</p>
<p>Guests may see in vivid reincarnation many of the great names of yesteryear, the old buccaneers who have shot and galloped through innumerable pages of <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> and fiction. For Tombstone as a lusty <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>ant is to rise and live again.</p>
<p>From the start the town has been steeped in adventure of the most dramatic kind. To those who know its story, the very mention of the town's name brings to mind a rapid panorama of fighting and death, of gaiety and pleasure in wild abandon, of murderous Indians, of stagecoach robberies, of cowboy episodes, of honky tonks and dance halls, of gun battles, of all the tense excitement only a booming frontier mining town can know. Over all the colorful western towns in fact or fiction, Tombstone boasts the embodiment of everything interesting in the firm-chinned era just past.</p>
<p>Standing today as a drab, dust-covered collection of houses sprawled along a transcontinental highway, Tombstone is so unattractive as to make unknowing tourists wonder why it is there.</p>
<p>But Tombstone's glory is in its past, and that glory will be seen this fall again when time is jerked abruptly backward half a century.</p>
<p>All of Arizona will co-operate in the celebration, because the state is proud of Tombstone. Once it was the metropolis, with a population of 15 thousand, when the second city had only 1,800 or so. It gave to the state millions of dollars in silver ore, and billions in romantic history. </p>

<p>ED SCHIEFFELIN will be at the party, not in person, for Ed died years ago in Oregon, a lonely millionaire, but by proxy because he is the father of Tombstone. Ed was the gay dog who drifted west from Pennsylvania, discontent with life on a farm, and turned up in the 1870's in southern Arizona, a swanky, handsome fellow afraid of nothing under the sun. Romance lived within him, romance and the spirit to go and do, to search and see, to find and take. Exactly the type who would have named Tombstone.</p>
<p>Ed was about to start prospecting alone into the hills of southern Arizona one day when a friend questioned him.</p>

<figure>
<ab>Regilding the Bird Cage is now going on in</ab>
<ab>Tombstone. . .to restore this famous theater</ab>
<ab>of the old west to what it was when Eddie Foy</ab>
<ab>and other noted variety actors played there.</ab>
</figure>
    
<p>"Where you going, Ed?"</p>
<p>"Over there. Lookin' for stones," he replied, and mounted his mule to ride away. But as that country was infested by murderous Apaches, his friend gave him a parting fling:</p>
<p>"The stone you'll find'll be your tombstone."</p>
<p>That same day two skeletons, bleached on a hillside with a pile of nuggets between them, led Ed to trace a rich silver float to a ledge which he promptly christened Tombstone; and filed claim on the discovery under that name.</p>
<p>That was in 1879&#8212;50 years ago. Near the spot three years later stood a roaring

<figure>
<ab>Ed Schieffelin. . . ."The stone you'll find will be </ab>
<ab>your tombstone," was the reply </ab>

<ab>". . .and another redskin bit the dust"</ab>
<ab>. . .a glimpse of a famed phase of</ab>
<ab>Tombstone's past that will be re-enacted</ab>
<ab>at the golden anniversary celebration.</ab>

helldorado, the town Arizona is preparing to re-create this fall.</p>
<p>The job will not be difficult. Chiefly, it will be a simple renovation and re-opening, for nearly every one of the important buildings, the famed landmarks, still stand. They are, of course, in poor repair, but that will be remedied before the celebration begins.</p>

<p>AT ONE time the old Bird Cage theater was the most famous amusement place in the west. It is still to be seen in Tombstone, its glory somewhat dimmed by two decades of idleness. In it played the best vaudeville&#8212;Variety it was called <choice><sic>them</sic><corr>then</corr></choice>&#8212;actors the country knew prior to 1900. </p>

Lotta Crabtree graced its stage. They are two of several who once were great names in the
amusement world, and whose memories <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> scarcely begun to fade.</p>
<p>The Bird Cage&#8212;so named because it was very small and intimate&#8212;will be open again, its bar in front will be tended by flabby, aproned barkeeps as of yore, while gentlemen and cowboys and miners and adventurers dressed in the fashions of 1881 lean with one foot on the bar rail, to drink and make merry.</p>
<p>No note of modernity will be allowed to creep in. The residents of Tombstone will see to it. Already they are growing whiskers, started back in July, as lush and luxurious as any Ed Schieffelin ever wore.</p>
<p>Already the newer buildings on Tough Nut street and other principal thoroughfares of Tombstone have been hidden behind false fronts, to make them "in character" with the thriving, seething municipality of the 80's. Hitching rails have reappeared, and horses will be tied there. Motor cars will be taboo, their honks replaced by pistol shots as the Clantons and the Earps again fight their murdersome duel in front of the assay office and the O.K. corral.</p>
<p>Over in Schieffelin hall, where more dignified stock companies presented drama of the period, where Theodore Roberts once acted, and Frederick Warde and Charles B. Hanford and others of their day, the big curtain will go up at regular intervals, and the same shows will be staged.</p>
<p>Modern merchandise will be removed from the show windows of the store. Modern signboards will be replaced with the original ones of their counterparts. Long-skirted women will stroll up the board sidewalks&#8212;covering modern cement&#8212;and all the men will be ornamented with forbidding pistols or knives. </p>

<p>DOWN in the front office of the Tombstone Epitaph, energetic newspaper of this extraordinary town, men and women will gather from time to time to chat with the editor as they used to do, or mayhap to cuss him and demand that he be less vitriolic in the expression of his opinions of them.</p> 
    
<p>Incidentally, the very first editor and founder of the Epitaph, and the first mayor of Tombstone, John P. Clumb, is one of the few oldtimers who will attend the celebration in person. Not many of the major characters of Tombstone's heyday are still living, but some of them are, and will be at the party.</p>
<p>The Epitaph is still published in the original Epitaph building. The paper was named at a meeting in the Can Can restaurant by Charles B. Hanford, who pointed out that Tombstone's newspaper should have an appropriate name.</p>
<p>If Ed Schieffelin or Doc Holliday or Wyatt Earp should, by the grace of God, suddenly return to their old haunts, they would marvel, doubtless, at finding the world so unchanged after half a century. For faithful restoration of this hell-roaring mining camp, that sprung up like a mushroom when Ed began to spread news of his big silver mine, is the aim of Arizonans who are spending thousands of dollars to make the celebration an artistic event.</p>

<p>THE old Tombstone stagecoach, too, was held up with surprising regularity in the period when life in the west was raw. This stage carried passengers, and frequently money chests to and from the mines. Holdups were so frequent, and so often by the same robbers, that drivers said they could recognize individuals among the masked outlaws by their voices saying, "Hands up, and keep 'em thar!"</p>
<p>The old coach will be seen again this year, rolling into town with its crowd of nineteenth century passengers, welcomed down Tough Nut street with shouts and shots from the nineteenth century citizenry.</p>
<p>Doubtless, too, the driver frequently will pull to an abrupt halt in front of Sheriff Behan, and from his high seat tell with vivid gesticulation and excited voice of being stuck up again on Skeleton bend. That&#8212;the stark reality of the old days&#8212;will be the theme of Tombstone's birthday celebration.</p>
<p>The Indian's contribution to Tombstone's romance will not be overlooked in the birthday party. It couldn't be, because the Indian was ever a prominent figure, a danger constantly faced by every settler outside the protection of town or camp.</p>
<p>The Tombstone country was terrorized for a time by the redoubtable Geronimo, foremost leader of the Apaches, whose tribal enmity for white men has not yet ceased. Geronimo is the great god of Indian deviltry in the southwest. Fantastic stories and legends about him can scarcely by exaggerated, so active was he 50 years ago.</p>
<p>Modern students find him a fascinating subject. Modern sentimentalists, only vaguely familiar with his bloody career, attempt to idolize him at times. One group attempted to raise a monument to him, as champion of the red man's cause. But some of the white old-timers dared anybody to try it and promised immediate destruction to any monument raised.</p>
<p>Geronimo hated the whites, not entirely without reason, possibly, and he plundered and killed for sheer love of it until he was almost too old to ride, showing rare cunning in eluding capture or in escaping if trapped.</p>
    
<figure>
<ab>Under this monument, modeled after the markers used by prospectors in</ab>
<ab>staking out claims, is buried Founder Ed Schieffelin . . .on the spot where</ab>
<ab>he first camped when he struck silver.</ab>
</figure>    

<p>WOVEN into the story of Tombstone is a tragic chapter which has become a classic in the western country. A party of braves had broken away from a reservation at San Carlos, and had left a black trail of burned homes and death as they moved southward, crossing the international line into Mexico, just south of Tombstone.</p>
<p>A troop of the Seventh cavalry was in pursuit. Their forces were increased by old settlers, among them John Slaughter, Tombstone's 
famed scout and guide.</p>
<p>Working like a hound on the scent of the braves, Slaughter located them encamped on a bench on a high mountain. As the next day was breaking, with the Indian camp still silent in sleep, the noise of army carbines sounded a terrible reveille. Bucks and squaws came tumbling from little groups of wickiups in the clearing. Those who were not shot down vanished in the hills. Pursuit was useless, so the soldiers returned to burn the village.</p>
<p>John Slaughter entered one crude dwelling and with his rifle pocked a sack of flour. The sack moved, and a black-haired baby girl, undisturbed by the shooting, awoke to stare at him.</p>
<p>Before slaughter picked her up a rifle cracked from up on the mountain side. Two soldiers promptly returned the fire, and went up to find a lone Apache buck lying dead behind a rock. He had slipped back to do what he could for his daughter.</p>
<p>Slaughter took her home to his cattle ranch near Tombstone and adopted her. She grew fast, proved to be exceptionally bright in adopting the way of civilization, once threatened in a fit of temper to kill her adopted mother, and herself was accidentally burned to death while still a child. She became known as Apache May, and later as "Patchy." She still lived in the memory of old Tombstone citizens. </p>
<p>Near the heat of Tombstone is a huge cone-shaped monument, made of rocks gathered from the vicinity, and modeled after the markers prospectors used to stake out mining claims. Under it is the grave of Ed Schieffelin, on the exact spot where he had camped when he made his first discovery.</p>

<p>WALTER SCOTT JARDINE is Scotch-English by descent. And many a pretty deal has he made in his life. Working for nothing a week up to $3.50 a day for Tom Murray in his local merchandising store at the northwest corner of Fourteenth and Harney streets, Walter Jardine, although a youngster not yet 15, bargained without restraint. Not only bargained but transacted deals on his own judgment that brought returns for his employer in goodly amounts.</p>
<p>Sometimes the profits on a deal would be just a few dollars. Many times it was more. His shrewd bargaining and foresight reached their peak in the employ of Mr. Murray when he bought and sold flour that had lain at the bottom of the Missouri River for three months at a $1,400 profit.</p>
<p>But one day when Walter had been alone in the office for some time save the comings and goings of Mr. Murray, the latter went to the cash drawer, and after looking in said, "Wait, there is a $2 bill missing from here."</p>
<p><choice><sic>Conservation</sic><corr>Conversation</corr></choice> ensued on the subject, and finally Walter said, "You don't think I took it, do you?"</p>
<p>Whereupon Mr. Murray answered, "Well, you are the only one who has been here outside of myself."</p>
<p>Walter drew his time. Mr. Murray paid him $2 short.</p>
<p>Walking down the street Walter met a man with a pair of ponies and wagon for sale. Having saved his money, Walter bargained for them. And the next day saw him preparing to go in business for himself.</p>
<p>Tom Murray also came to him the next day to get him to come back. He offered to buy the team and let Walter use them. He offered him $7 a day to return.</p>
<p>"I found that $2 bill in my pocket," informed Murray.</p>
<p>"Let's see it," said Walter.</p>
<p>Walter examined the bill and put it in his pocket. "That's the $2 you owe me. As for coming back, I wouldn't work for you again for the whole state of Nebraska. When you questioned my honesty, in fact, accused me of stealing, you did something to me I'll never forget."</p>
<p>So Walter Jardine become one of six draymen in Omaha at the time. A start which culminated in his becoming head of one of the largest express and transfer companies in the middle west.</p>
    
<p>BACK in the late 60's his folks boarded the ship's carpenters that came here to build the scows to put in the Union Pacific bridge. It was his job to buy vegetables for the table from an old woman who lived nearby. One day a bright idea struck him and he said to the old woman, "I'll give you $10 for all that you have in your garden, providing you let me come and get it when I want it."</p>
<p>The woman, eager to get her hands on so much money at once, agreed. So Walter got the vegetables, enough for the family table through the season, and sufficient for him to sell and make a net profit of $40.</p>
<p>When the Union Pacific bridge was building, Charles Hayes, in charge of the work, who liked the boy, said, "I'm going to let you launch<unclear reason="torn"></unclear>
as the Ogden house. "Looking back from there, I could still see sleds coming across the river," recalled Mr. Jardine.</p>
<p>In 1888, when the Douglas street bridge was completed and people held a big celebration because Omaha had a fine big toll bridge at last, he was in charge of the parade, and as grand marshall supervised one of the biggest processions and assemblies of its kind ever held hereabout.</p>
    
<p>THEN came the organization of Ak-Sar-Ben, which Mr. Jardine says was in 1894, and grew out of a group of business men meeting to discuss arousing greater interest in the state fair and the affairs of Omaha.</p>
<p>At a meeting of business men the plans for Ak-Sar-Ben were made. Mr. Jardine had been custodian of exhibits and a director of the state fair and was one of the group. Others present he recalls included John E. Utt, Clement Chase, William Lyle Dickey, Dudley Smith, Elmer E. Bryson, H. J. Penfold, Judge E. M. Bartlett, Lewis M. Rheem, William R. Bennett, R. S. Wilcox, Mel Uhl and H. Vance Lane. This was followed by a trip to New Orleans and the purchase of Mardi Gras equipment. Later Mr. Jardine was delegated as a committee of one to purchase the Coliseum at Twentieth and Paul streets, which had been built at a cost of more than 25 thousand dollars. With those who had the power to sell the property he struck a bargain to purchase the same for 12 thousand dollars. Then they backed out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Ak-Sar-Ben had been renting "The Den" or Coliseum for one hundred dollars a month. Mr. Jardine was determined that he would put through the deal. He consulted with Herman Kountze, president of the First National bank, and "secured" much property between Harney and St. Mary's avenue above Seventeenth. An architect was called in and drew striking plans for a brand new Ak-Sar-Ben to be "erected in the immediate future" on "this newly acquired central site."</p>
<p>Coliseum officials came clamoring to put through the original deal. "The price is now $11,500," declared Mr. Jardine, and the deal was made with him. Of this amount he traded in seven lots for seven thousand dollars that he owned at Thirty-third and Leavenworth streets, which had cost him four thousand dollars, and gave his check for the $4,500 difference. Then "by way of lark" the board of Ak-Sar-Ben<unclear reason="torn"></unclear>
a formal invitation to the congress to meet in
Omaha the following year. It was accepted.
Late in November of 189<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> the congress assembled
in Omaha.</p>
<p>Mr. Jardine had worked to get it here, but
money, he says, for the entertainment was hard
to get. He started the ball rolling with $20. L.
M. Rheem gave $10, and from the rest of the
city they got $25. But they persuaded John
Markell of the Millard hotel to give a big banquet
free. Other hotel men contributed in a 
like manner, from John A. Creighton they obtained
rent free, both Creighton hall and theater,
the Lininger art gallery helped, they used
the Den, and out there gave a big dinner.</p>
<p>Despite the depressing effects of a financial
panic throughout the country at this time <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>
had been much talk of a western exposition<unclear reason="torn"></unclear>
many cities west of Chicago. Mr. Jardine<unclear reason="torn"></unclear>
that with Mr. Rheem he stood in a down<unclear reason="torn"></unclear>
bar one day, and L.M. Rheem enthusing
the congress in Omaha said, "Let's ask

<p>"And it may be news to you that Ak-Sar-Ben and Gus Renze had a whole lot to do with the success of holding the exposition," he added.</p>
<p>Well, anyway the first thing Mr. Jardine did was go out to the Den and order from Gus 285 paper mache mallard ducks, "roasted and browned to a turn." Then he went to the head<unclear reason="page folded"></unclear>

<head type="sub">PLAN TO MAKE THE EXPOSITION A SUCCESS</head>    
<head type="sub">Getting Ready to Invite Exhibitors to Participate in the Great Show of 1898&#8212;Some Appointments Made.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The Department of Exhibits of the Transmississippi and International exposition is in active operation and prospective exhibitors in all parts of the United States and the civilized world will soon be in possession of the rules and conditions under which they may participate in the great fair of the western states. Manager E. E. Bruce completed temporary arrangements with the exposition expert to which reference has heretofore been made, and will ask the sanction of the executive committee at its next session and will request authority to enter into a permanent agreement with the gentleman. In the meantime Manager Bruce is proceeding with the work of his bureau as rapidly as possible, and will be prepared to submit to the executive committee a comprehensive outline of the work proposed for the Department of Exhibits. A form of blank application for space is being prepared, and also rules and regulations for the government of exhibitors. As soon as these are approved by the executive committee they will be sent out in order that those desiring to exhibit at the exposition may have as much time as possible to prepare their exhibits. It is also expected by Manager Bruce that this method will incite the inventive geniuses to prepare and exhibit some rare and wonderful inventions which will attract the attention of the thousands of visitors to the great fair. </p>
    </div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">BRUCE SECURES AN EXPERT.</head>    
<p>The man whom Manager Bruce has retained to look after the detail of this work is H. B. Hardt. Mr. Hardt is a Belgian by birth, a cosmopolitan by choice and an exposition expert by profession. He has taken an active part in all of the important expositions which have been held in the world during the past twenty-three years. Commencing with the Vienna exposition in 1873, Mr. Hardt has been identified in a prominent manner with the following expositions: The Centennial exposition, held in Philadelphia in 1876; the London Crystal Palace exposition, held in 1884; the Alexandria exposition, held in London in 1885; the Colonial and Indian exposition, held in London in 1886; the Calcutta, India, exposition in 1887; the Adelaide, Australia, exposition in 1887; the Melbourne exposition in 1888; the Paris exposition in 1889; the Tasmania exposition in 1892; the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893; the California Midwinter fair in 1894; the Northwestern Fair, held in Portland, Ore., in 1895 and the Leadville fair, held in 1895. Mr. Hardt has an array of diplomas and medals in token of services rendered by him in connection with all of these events and is an encyclopedia of information respecting the conduct of expositions. </p>

<head type="sub">HUNT ASSISTS HITCHCOCK.</head>    
<p>Manager Hitchcock of the Department of Promotion announces the appointment of E. C. Hunt as chief clerk of the department. Mr. Hunt is a newspaper man of several years' active experience and has lately been the Omaha correspondent for a number of outside papers, both in this state and among the states of the east and west. Mr. Hitchcock stated this morning that the first work to be done by his department would be to open correspondence with the members of the all the legislatures in the transmississippi states for the purpose of lawing before them the plan and scope of the Transmississippi Exposition and securing their co-operation in support of the exposition. This will be followed by the formation of a local organization at each of the state capitals composed of prominent men in the several states with a view of furthering the interest of the exposition by securing appropriations for state exhibits. All work in this line will be done through these local organizations. Manager Hitchcock said the work of his department would be pushed with the greatest possible speed in order to accomplish as much as possible before the legislatures have adjourned.</p>
<p>Secretary Wakefield has received copies of Los Angeles Cal., papers from Vice President G. W. Parsons of California. These papers contain accounts of a public meeting held in Los Angeles the latter part of last week. At this meeting were present all of the members of the California legislature, representing the southern counties, together with a large number of the most prominent business men, members and officers of the Board of Trade and other commercial organizations. The meeting was called for the purpose of conferring with the legislators regarding necessary legislations to be enacted at the approaching session. Prominent among the subjects discussed was that of a large appropriation for a California exhibit
at the Transmississippi Exposition. Mr. Parsons advocated the appropriation of $75,000 for the purpose of making a creditable exhibit and explained in detail the way in which this amount should be expended. J. L. Filcher, secretary of the State Board of Trade, advocated a liberal appropriation, laying particular stress upon the advantage California had derived from the exhibit made at the Atlanta exposition, and specified the manner in which this good result had been felt. He urged the legislature to make a liberal appropriation, which would be an advertisement for the state and would bring the resources of the state prominently before the world.</p>

<head type="sub">FINAL MOVES TO NATIONAL RECOGNITION</head>
<head type="sub">Dave Mercer Prepares a Bill to Remedy Some Technical Defects in the Law and Save the Appropriation.</head>
<p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 21&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;At last the articles of incorporation of the Transmississippi and International Exposition association have been received and have been presented to the treasury officials by Representative Mercer. Assistant Secretary Curtis received them and after examination stated that they appeared to cover all points and promised Mr. Mercer that the Treasury department would act at once. Until action is taken by this branch of government it has been impossible to move toward securing an appropriation, and this is what held up Senator Allen's resolution, which has been referred to Senator Thurston's committee on international expositions. Just as soon, however, as the Treasury department passes upon the articles of incorporation and certificates to stock subscription, the legislative branch of the government will proceed to make certain appropriations. Mercer will tomorrow introduce an amended bill to cover the technical objections made by the Treasury department to the bill in its present form. This is done that no possible slip may be made in having the exposition avail itself of the appropriation as contemplated in the bill as now a law. The course of recognition of the articles of incorporation will be very simple. After satisfying themselves of the validity of the same and passing upon the stock subscriptions, the same will be certified to the committee on appropriations and the sum made immediately available. </p></div2>

<dateline>THE EVENING BEE:<lb/>    
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 23 1896</dateline>
<head type="main">REVISED AT THE TREASURY</head>
<head type="sub">OMAHA DRAFT IS SLIGHTLY MODIFIED</head>
<head type="sub">Mercer Introduces the New Measure in the House, Where He Looks for Early and Favorable Action.</head>    
<p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 22.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Representative Mercer today introduced his bill to amend an act entitled "An Act to Authorize and Encourage the Holding of a Transmississippi International Exposition in the City of Omaha, in the Year 1898, approved June 10, 1896." The bill, as introduced, upon suggestions from the Treasury department, changes in some particulars the draft as made by the directors in Omaha. When Representative Mercer called upon the treasury officials Monday with the bill and certified articles of incorporation from the Nebraska State department, he presented a new amendment to Secretary Curtis for revision and suggestion. The bill as introduced today makes the following changes in draft as made in Omaha:</p>
<p>Section 3.&#8212;After the word "museum," in the twelfth line, insert "and fish commission;' in the fifteenth line, same section, after the word "department," insert "institution," and after "museum" insert "and commission."</p>
<p>Section 5.&#8212;In the fourth line, after "expense of," insert "preparation;" after "transportation," in the same line, insert the word "installation." In the fourteenth line of the same section strike out after the word "exhibit" the words "to Omaha and from Omaha to Washington." </p>
<p>Section 6 is wholly new, and is as follows: "That members of the board of management of the government exhibit created by this act and all other employes detailed for duty under them, including officers of the army and navy, shall be entitled to receive actual expenses for travel and subsistence while necessarily absent from their homes engaged upon the business of said board. This allowance shall be in lieu of transportation and mileage now allowed by law to officers of the army and navy."</p>
<p>Section 9 is entirely eliminated, Mr. Mercer's idea being that the amount appropriated will have to be made available in an appropriation bill, and that the section as it was drafted in Omaha would greatly jeopardize the passage of the bill. Since the passage of the Nashville Exposition bill the treasury people have somewhat changed their idea as to the governmental cost of the Exposition at Omaha. They feel now certain that $300,000 would be ample to make an exhibit almost as complete as that of Chicago.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that Nashville will hold an exposition a year before Omaha and that the government is expected to make a small exhibit there, that exhibit upon the close of the exposition would be boxed and stored, ready to ship the following year to Omaha. In this case, therefore, Nashville would be paying somewhat for Omaha's exhibit. It was further contended by the Treasury department that to limit transportation from Washington to Omaha and return would deprive the Gate City of exhibits held not only in Boston, but on the Pacific coast, and, being in favor of Omaha, Acting Secretary Curtis suggested the changes as outlined above.</p> 
<p>In this connection Senator Allen received a letter from Secretary Curtis today in reply to an inquiry of his regarding the proposed amendment to the urgency deficiency bill. The letter follows closely one directed to Mr. Mercer by the department some weeks ago. After reviewing certain sections of the former act, which seems to the department inadequate to accomplish a satisfactory governmental exhibit, the letter from Secretary Curtis continues: "This office is of the opinion that if the act authorizing the Transmississippi and International Exposition at Omaha were amended by the substitution of the provisions suggested, that the difficulties of administering the law would be materially reduced, because business would then be conducted along lines already somewhat settled by the practice of the department and opinions of the comptroller in connection with expositions heretofore held."</p> 
<p>Mr. Mercer has no fear of the bill as amended passing the house, but doubts very much if $500,000 can be made available. He believes that $300,000, however, can be secured in one of the appropriation bills, and fixes that sum as the minimum which he will take. </p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="main">BEGIN ACTIVE OPERATIONS</head>
<head type="sub">EXPOSITION MANAGERS HARD AT WORK</head>
<head type="sub">Department of Promotion Enters Upon the Task of Interesting Legislators of Transmississippi States in the Great Show.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The heads of departments of the Transmississippi and International Exposition association are daily impressed with the fact that the exposition is going to be a more extensive enterprise than they had conceived of. As the work of the several departments is being commenced, this fact stands out above all others and the magnitude of the affair is almost overwhelming. The managers are rising to the occasion, however, and have individually determined to put the best foot foremost and keep the thing moving. Since the information has gone forth to the world that the Transmississippi Exposition was to be a "go," there has been an influx of men with experience in the multiplicity of details which go to make up a successful exposition, and the several managers have been supplied with information which has not only been of material advantage to them in avoiding serious mistakes, but has impressed them most forcibly with the magnitude of the work in which they are engaged.</p>
<p>In addition to the H. B. Hardt, referred to yesterday as having been retained by Manager Bruce of the Department of Exhibits, there are several men with more or less experience in exposition work who are seeking engagements with one or another department.</p>
<p>The Department of Promotion commenced active work this morning. Six typewriters were installed in a room adjoining the office of Secretary Wakefield on the third floor of The Bee building and were started on the work of turning out personal letters to the state officers and members of the legislatures of the transmississippi states. These clerks are under the direction of Chief Clerk Hunt and will be kept hard at work for the next few weeks grinding out correspondence.</p>

<pb n="12" xml:id="TMISB02-012"/>

<p>Manager Lindsey of the Department Ways and Means is sending out letters to all of the real estate dealers in the city asking for the names of all nonresident real estate owners in order that they may be solicited for subscriptions to the exposition. It is expected by this means to increase the subscription list very materially. Other steps are being taken to reach other individuals as well as a large number of wealthy corporations which have not subscribed.</p>
    </div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">AMUSEMENT FEATURES PROPOSED.</head>
<p>Manager A. L. Reed of the Department of Concessions is overwhelmed with applications of all kinds. A number of inventors have applied for space for engineering novelties, and this feature of the exposition gives promise of forming a most attractive portion of the great fair. Prominent among the applications is one by an Omaha inventor which has the merit of real novelty. The inventor proposes to construct a large lake which shall be at least thirty feet in depth. This is to be stocked with submarine foliage and fish of all kinds. In the center of this lake and the inventor intends to have erected a tower several hundred feet in height, forming a double elevator shaft, on which shall be two glass cars, each capable of containing a number of people. The passengers will be first treated to a bird's-eye view of the exposition and surrounding country by being carried to the top of the tower, and will then be lowered to the bottom of the lake, where electric illumination will enable them to make investigations into the everyday life of the finny tribe which will inhabit the depths of the lake, as well as of the beautiful foliage and plant life. The inventor of this novelty has taken steps to interest local capital in the enterprise, and is said to have his plans in very satisfactory shape.</p>
<p>Another engineering attraction for which space is requested is the invention of a Chicago engineer. He calls his contrivance a "soaring carousal," but whether it is a flying machine, a dirigible balloon or some other method of visiting the upper atmosphere he does not disclose. He says, however, that he can carry parties of 200 people to any desired height and can make three trips an hour. He also says that he intends erecting his machine at the Paris exposition in 1900, and desires to erect one in Omaha first.</p>
<p>Manager Reed is considering the advisability of establishing a branch office in Chicago for the purpose of better reaching the concessionaires whose presence is most desirable, especially those in the amusement line. He has been in correspondence with Chicago parties regarding this matter and says he will have a more definite idea when the executive committee meets next Saturday. The duty of looking after the affairs of the Department of Concessions has become so onerous that Manager Reed has appointed W. H. Crary as his assistant, and Mr. Crary is gradually assuming full charge of the immense amount of detail work connected with this important department. The advisability of sending a commissioner to Europe to secure novelties such as the "German village" at the World's fair and attractions of a like nature is also being considered by Manager Reed.</p>
    </div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WHAT THE SITE IS DETERMINED.</head>
<p>Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds is making a thorough investigation into the best methods to be pursued to secure the most effective administration of his department. He says he will not commence active operations until the location of the exposition is determined. As soon as that is done the work of the department will be commenced in earnest. Manager Kirkendall stated this morning that the first step would probably be to employ an experienced engineer and an architect and he added that the selection of these officials would be made with the greatest care. A number of applications for these positions have been received by Mr. Kirkendall.</p>
<p>The members of the executive committee expressed themselves as being entirely satisfied with the amendments and alterations made in the exposition bill now in the hands of Congressman Mercer. The original draft was prepared in this city and was drawn in accordance with the result of the deliberate consideration given the matter by the executive committee at its first meeting. The alterations detailed in The Bee's Washington dispatches will have the effect of widening the scope of the bill in a few minor particulars, but does not change its general effect, as first drawn. It increases the size of the board to be in charge of the government exhibit by providing for two more members than was contemplated by the bill, as drawn, and also makes provision for installing the government exhibit, thereby providing for a large item of expense which might have been thrown onto the exposition managers. As the bill now stands, it provides for an appropriation of $200,000 for a government building and an additional sum of $300,000 for a government exhibit, but does not carry an appropriation.</p></div3>

<p>While there is no legal requirement making it obligatory upon the president to make official proclamation to the world that Omaha is to hold an exposition in 1898, it is generally understood by the exposition officials that Congressman Mercer will use every effort to induce President Cleveland to immediately issue such a proclamation. The local officials were greatly pleased with the information contained in the telegram quoted heretofore, and say that this removes the last vestige of doubt regarding the support of the enterprise by the national government.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">CONGRESSMAN MERCER.</head>
<head type="sub">New Honors Await Nebraska's Popular Hustler.</head>
<ab>Washington Post.</ab>
<p>There have been few men in the house in a decade who have enjoyed as much popularity among their associates as Representative Mercer of Nebraska. That is because he is sincerely good-natured, and large and athletic enough to inspire admiration. He is a tall, blue-eyed westerner, with a breezy something in his manner that appeals to men and draws at their heart-strings. Men who, like Mercer, combine great energy with a royal disposition, and no egotism, are somewhat exceptional. For he is known in the house as one of the greatest hustlers on the congressional pay roll. He seldom makes a speech, and therein vindicates the philosopher who observed that it is wrong to estimate a man's usefulness in congress by the length of his speeches. Omaha wanted a national exposition and asked for a couple of hundred thousand dollars from the government as an evidence of its interest and generosity. The circumstances under which Mercer obtained it would have discouraged any man of ordinary fiber, but, after having been balked at every turn for weeks, he rushed his bill through in the closing hours of the session, under difficulties that made the victory heroical. He was made secretary of the republican congressional committee in the late campaign and was one of the chief promoters of the admirable system under which the affairs of that committee were administered. There is much talk among members of giving him the chairmanship of the committee and thus practically the management of the congressional campaign which the republicans will wage in 1898. The choice could hardly fall upon a man better qualified to fill the place. He was for years an active factor in the successful campaigns which the republican party made in Nebraska, acting alternately as secretary and chairman of the state committee. He is a fine organizer and a shrewd adept at a political game of chess.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Heads of Exposition Departments Tell of Work Done.</head>
<p>The executive committee of the Trans-Mississippi exposition met yesterday afternoon, with President Wattles and all the members present.</p>
<p>Thomas H. Wells, vice president for South Dakota, was introduced, and stated what he considered to be the needs in his state to secure desirable legislation for an exhibit. His suggestions were turned over to the department of promotion for action.</p>
<p>Manager Lindsey reported that he had arranged with C. A. Starr to act as superintendent of the department of ways and means and the selection was approved.</p>
<p>Manager Rosewater gave an outline of the work done by the department of publicity to date, including his selection of J. B. Haynes as chief of the press bureau. He also requested a stenographer and typewriter, and the appointment and recommendation were approved. He mentioned the possible need of a German correspondent at a reasonable salary, but this matter was deferred for the present.</p>
<p>Manager Hitchcock made a report covering the doings of the department of promotion. His appointment of E. C. Hunt as chief clerk of the department was confirmed, as was also his temporary employment of six typewriters. He was authorized to send E. P. Roggen to Phoenix, Ariz., to push the interests of the exposition before the legislature of that territory.</p>
<p>F. D. Higbee of Chicago, an applicant for an important position with the exposition, was accorded a hearing to give his ideas of management to secure representation from other states, especially in Illinois.</p>
<p>Manager Bruce reported that the greatest task he had in the department of exhibits was to prepare suitable rules governing exhibits. He had drafted such rules and requested that a special meeting of the committee be held at an early date to consider these rules. He had employed H. B. Hardt as an assistant until the close of the exposition, and would want a stenographer in about ten days. He wanted authority to make a contract with an agent in every county in the United States and in foreign countries to work up exhibits. The appointment of Mr. Hardt was confirmed, and in place of a special meeting of the committee to consider rules the latter was referred to Mr. Bruce, Mr. Reed, Mr. Hardt and Mr. Wakefield.</p>
<p>Manager Reed from the department of concessions reported that W. H. Crary, whom he had selected as clerk, had declined to serve, but that no new appointment would be made at this time.</p>
<p>Manager Kirkendall reported that his time was occupied in trying to agree upon some suitable man for superintendent of construction, and the importance of the position made the selection all the more difficult.</p>
<p>The bids for exposition offices were taken up and referred to Lindsey, Kirkendall, Bruce and Reed to report at the next meeting.
The meeting then adjourned. </p></div2>

<p>The managers of the Transmississippi and International Exposition begin to feel that the preliminary work of the exposition that is to be held in Omaha during 1898 is now well under way, and that unless some preventing providence intervenes, the display will be the greatest and the best that has ever been seen in the United States, barring the Columbian exposition, held in Chicago in 1893.</p>
<p>Members of the Board of Managers and also the members of the Board of Directors held meetings yesterday and accomplished considerable in the way of outlining plans for future work. They also started the work of getting the bureaus in active operation, besides receiving bids for permanent offices for the heads and working forces of the various departments. In addition to this the members of the two bodies devoted considerable time to the discussion of the promotion of the enterprise and the best way of giving it the greatest publicity.</p>
<p>Besides what was accomplished locally, last night The Bee received word from its Washington correspondent that the United States Treasury department had passed upon the articles of incorporation and that tomorrow President Cleveland will be notified of their approval.

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEETING.</head>
<head type="sub">Bureau Chiefs Report on Some of Their Appointments.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The executive committee of the Transmississippi and International Exposition association held its regular weekly meeting at the Commercial club rooms at noon yesterday.</p>
<p>Thomas H. Wells of Hot Springs, S. D., vice president of the Exposition association for South Dakota, was introduced and interrogated regarding the situation in his state in relation to the exposition. He explained the situation from his point of view and detailed the things he considered necessary to be done in order to secure favorable action by the legislature on an appropriation. His suggestions were referred to the department of promotion and the department was later authorized to request Mr. Wells to co-operate with the Exposition association in the matter of state support.</p>
<p>Manager Lindsey of the department of ways and means reported that he had appointed C. A. Starr as superintendent of the department. His action was approved.</p>
<p>Manager Rosewater reported that he had appointed J. B. Haynes as superintendent of the press bureau. His action was approved after a very acrimonious debate between Mr. Rosewater and Mr. Hitchcock, in which the latter entered strenuous objections to the appointment for the reason that Mr. Haynes was "particularly obnoxious" to him. Mr. Hitchcock made his objection more on the ground of the salary to be paid Mr. Haynes, but when it was apparent that this objection did not have sufficient weight with the board he made his objections on personal grounds. Mr. Rosewater defended his appointment and the other members of the board supported him, the vote showing six for approval and Mr. Hitchcock's vote being the only recorded against it.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosewater was granted authority to employ one stenographer and one typewriter for his department. </p>
    </div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">MATTERS IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS.</head>
<p>The department of promotion was next called and Manager Hitchcock reported that he had appointed E. C. Hunt as chief clerk, and had employed six typewriters temporarily. He asked that his action be approved and this was done after some little discussion. Mr. Hitchcock then asked authority to send E. P. Roggen to Arizona for the purpose of trying to secure the passage of a bill through the legislature of that state, making an appropriation for a state exhibit, and to pay him $200 for his services. Mr. Rosewater took a hand in the discussion and said, addressing Mr. Hitchcock, "I did not raise any objection when you appointed Hunt, one of your witnesses in your libel suit against The Bee, but if you are going to bring in all of them to have this committee pay them for the work they have been doing for you, I raise an objection. Moreover, I don't believe this man can do anything with the legislature of Arizona."</p>
<p>This precipitated another wordy debate, which was settled by granting Mr. Hitchcock the authority to employ E. P. Roggen and send him to Arizona in the interest of the exposition, with certain restrictions as to payment for his services.</p>
<p>F. D. Higbee of Chicago, an expert in exposition matters, was introduced and gave the committee a number of valuable "pointers" on the management of an exposition with especial reference to securing appropriations from other states.</p>
<p>Manager Bruce of the department of exhibits submitted a report of the doings of his department up to date and stated that he had appointed H. B. Hardt to serve until the close of the exposition. Mr. Bruce also stated that he had prepared a set of rules and regulations governing exhibits which were very lengthy, and he asked that the committee hold a special session for considering these rules, stating that he regarded the matter as highly important and necessary to be acted on at once. The appointment of Mr. Hardt was approved, and Messrs. Bruce, Reed, Hardt and Wakefield were appointed a committee to examine and approve the rules.</p>
<p>Manager Reed of the department of concessions reported that W. H. Crary, whom he had appointed as his assistant, had declined to accept the appointment, and Mr. Reed announced that he would not make any other appointment for the present, but said he should require the services of an expert on concessions within the next thirty days.</p>
<p>The tenders of rooms for headquarters, which had been referred to the executive committee by the directors, were referred to a committee comprising Messrs. Lindsey, Kirkendall, Reed and Bruce to report at the next meeting of the executive committee.</p>

<p>A meeting of the board of directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition association was held at the Commercial club rooms at 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon. There were thirty-nine directors present.</p>
<p>The resignation of John A. Wakefield as a member of the board of directors was read and accepted, and the board proceeded to fill the vacancy by ballot. Nominations being in order, I. W. Carpenter nominated George W. Lininger. C. F. Weller nominated Allen T. Rector. W. N. Babcock presented the claim of South Omaha for representation on the board and placed Thomas Hoctor in nomination. F. M. Youngs made an appeal for further representation for the laboring interests and nominated William Bell, one of the three men selected by organized labor.</p>
<p>Messrs. Wharton and Bruce were appointed tellers and the balloting commenced.</p>
<p>The vote stood as follows: Lininger, 4; Rector, 21; Hoctor, 11; Bell, 2; J. W. Hartz, Council Bluffs, 1. Allen T. Rector was declared elected.</p>
<p>Secretary Wakefield requested that a committee be appointed to audit his books. One motion of J. C. Wharton the chair appointed a committee of three, G. H. Payne, A. T. Rector and I. W. Carpenter.</p>
<p>Tenders of rooms for the use of the exposition association were opened and read. These were as follows: Thomas L. Kimball, the third floor of the Strang building at Tenth and Farnam streets at $50 per month, the board to place the rooms in repair and make such alterations as may be necessary; W. A. Paxton, jr., ten rooms on the fifth floor of the Ware block at $960 per annum; W. A. Paxton, ten rooms on the sixth floor of the Paxton block at $1,200 per year, including heat and janitor service; J. J. Brown, the entire third floor of the Brown block, Sixteenth and Douglas streets, consisting of sixteen rooms, at $250 per month; Thomas Swobe, manager of the Mercer hotel, as many rooms in the Mercer hotel as may be necessary at $300 each per annum; N. P. Feil for The Bee Building company, seven rooms on the fourth floor of The Bee building at $90 per month, with the privilege of additional rooms at specified prices. The tenders were referred to the executive committee.</p>
<p>The by-laws prepared by the executive committee were read. They were amended to provide that regular meetings of the board of directors shall be held on the Friday following the first Saturday in each month and were then adopted.</p>
<p>Allen T. Rector, the newly elected director, was introduced and made a brief address, pledging his support of the exposition.</p>
<p>J. C. Wharton introduced a resolution providing that the president, secretary and chairman of the executive committee be made a committee to devise a plan for extending the exposition throughout the transmississippi states and report the same to the board at its next meeting. The resolution was adopted.</p>
<p>F. M. Youngs, the labor representative on the board, introduced a resolution providing that "all questions of paramount importance and the letting of all large contracts for buildings, grading, etc., shall be submitted to the board of directors before final action is taken by the executive committee. The resolution was generally discussed, the consensus of opinion being against it, on the ground that it was too sweeping and would simply serve to hamper the executive committee. A motion to defer action was voted down and the motion was lost by an overwhelming vote.</p>
<p>The board then adjourned until January 9, when tenders of an exposition site will be opened.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">MEETS WITH CARLISLE'S APPROVAL</head>
<head type="sub">Exposition Subscriptions Satisfactory to Secretary of Interior.</head>
<p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 26.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;President Cleveland will be formally notified on Monday by Secretary Carlisle that he has approved of the stock subscriptions made in favor of the Transmississippi and International Exposition, to be held in Omaha in 1898, and has passed favorably upon the articles of incorporation filed with the State department of Nebraska.</p>
<p>When Representative Mercer left the amended articles of incorporation and the required certification with the secretary, then acting Hon. W. E. Curtis, he was assured that immediate action would be taken. The Treasury department passed upon this matter today, and immediately recognized the gilt-edged character of the subscriptions, which amount to upwards of $350,000. To make immediately available the sum of $200,000, appropriated at the last session of congress, the sanction of the secretary of the treasury had to be had, therefore this action. Plans are being made in the architect's office for a building to cost about $50,000, and the president in consideration of the communication from the Treasury department will name the government commission to have charge of the government exhibit within a day or two. Should the amended bill, introduced by Mr. Mercer last Tuesday, be passed, he says it would in no wise interfere with the appointment of commissioners, but would give them extended powers and wider scope in which to form and make the government exhibit and also larger and more commodious building for the same. The president will appoint
    
<pb n="14" xml:id="TMISB02-014"/>


    
representatives from the Treasury department, Bureau of Education, Interior department, Fish commission, Geological survey, Postoffice department, Department of Agriculture and other departments mentioned in the act. These commissioners will be empowered to employ labor and help necessary for preparing the exhibit and carpenters and day laborers to set it up in the government building in Omaha.</p>
<p>There was no question as to the character of the stock subscriptions as filed by directors of the Exposition company and there was no doubt as to action that would be taken by the secretary of the treasury. The fact, however, that the secretary passed upon the stock subscriptions favorably today and transmitted a formal letter of their acceptance and certifying the articles of incorporation makes it obligatory upon the president to appoint the commissioners within the next few days. This letter will reach the president on Monday and he will consult with heads of various bureaus, expecting to make exhibits in Omaha in 1898, for the purpose of appointing as commissioners the very best men who are in the departments. A number of them have gone through exposition work before at Atlanta, Philadelphia and Chicago, and it may be possible that some of these same men will have charge of the exhibit at Omaha.</p>
<p>Representative and Mrs. Mercer leave for the west on Sunday morning and will be in Omaha at the Millard hotel December 30 and 31. Before leaving Mr. Mercer stated that he had requested the president to issue his proclamation, but has not yet received his reply. The matter, therefore, will remain in abeyance until Monday or Tuesday, when a definite answer may be expected from the president.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">IN LINE FOR THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>Central City Nonpareil: The Omaha exposition is gaining force each day. Over $400,000 worth of stock has been subscribed for.</p>
<p> Albion News: Nebraska's great world's fair, in other words, the Transmississippi Exposition of 1898, is now fully officered. The officers and directors are composed of the best business men of Omaha and there is no doubt that this will be the biggest thing for the great west that has ever been attempted.</p>
<p>Schuyler Sun: Now that the executive officers of the Transmississippi Exposition have been elected, the enterprise will be rapidly pushed. The incoming state legislature should not be slow in doing the proper thing in the way of an appropriation commensurate with the great benefit the exposition will be to the state.</p>
<p>Seward Reporter: The board of directors of the Transmississippi Exposition has been selected, chiefs of the various bureaus have been appointed and the work of pushing forward the enterprise will at once begin. The best men in Omaha have been enlisted in the work and the success of the great exposition will be assured beyond a doubt.</p>
<p>Schuyler Herald: No <choice><sic>alse</sic><corr>false</corr></choice> ideas of economy should stand in the way of a good sized appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition at the hands of the Nebraska legislature. There are numerous other ways in which they can show their regard for economy. It is a good virtue to cultivate, but they should not commence at the wrong end of the line.</p>
<p>Fullerton Post: The Transmississippi fair is getting into shape with rapidity and good order. That it will be a great success is an admitted fact. Nance county will be in it up to her ears. We have the best county in the state and it behooves our people to make this fact known. When the time comes for Nance county to grab hold of the towline you can bet all you are worth that it will not be done in a halfhearted manner.</p>
<p>Minden Gazette: Officers have been chosen for the Transmississippi Exposition and the active work of preparation will being at once. It should be made an object lesson of the resources and enterprise of the great west, and as such assist, in the further development of the greatest and best spot of ground on earth. The south doesn't begin to compare with the west, and this exposition should demonstrate the fact, and it will if all will take hold with such a purpose in view. The only speculation in it should be simply that which follows the settling up and development of a new country by a legitimate increase of business.</p>
<p>Hastings Tribune: It is very important that everybody in Nebraska should take a great interest in the Transmississippi Exposition, which will be held in Omaha in 1898. It's going to be a big thing for Nebraska. In fact it will be the best thing Nebraska ever had or will have for many years. The committee has already secured subscriptions amounting to over $400,000 to its capital stock, and congress has pledged not less than $200,00 for a government exhibit. Now, the thing for the Nebraska legislature to do is to make a like pledge and the exposition will be a grand and glorious success, of which all Nebraska will feel proud.</p></div2>
    
<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">CLEVELAND AND THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">President's Views on the Issuance of a Proclamation.</head>
<p>Secretary Wakefield of the Transmississippi and International Exposition association received a letter this morning from Congressman D. H. Mercer, enclosing a letter received by him from President Cleveland's private secretary, stating that the president was of the opinion that he had no power to issue a proclamation announcing to the world that an exposition is to be held in Omaha in 1898, for the reason that the act providing for a government exhibit does not expressly authorize the president to take such action.</p>
<p>It is also stated that the only instance in which proclamations of this kind have been issued by presidents was in the case of the Cotton States exposition, when President Arthur issued a proclamation, and in the case of the World's fair, when President Harrison issued a similar proclamation. Secretary Thurber states that in both of these instances the president was authorized by act of congress to make such proclamation. Mr. Mercer informs Secretary Wakefield that he has made another application to the president for a proclamation and suggests that, whether the president issues a proclamation or not, the exposition association should notify the Department of State of the fact that an exposition is to be held, describing its character and requesting the secretary of state to issue an invitation to foreign governments to participate in the exposition. Mr. Mercer states that in the case of the Tennessee Centennial exposition to be held at Nashville next year the secretary of state transmitted to foreign governments, through the representatives of this government at the foreign capitals, invitations to participate in the exposition, and the congressman suggests that the same course might be followed by the transmississippi association. This letter will be presented to the executive committee at its next meeting for consideration. Mr. Mercer will be in Omaha about the middle of this week and the executive committee will endeavor to hold a conference with him on exposition matters.</p>
<p>The department of promotion is sending out letters to each member of each legislature of the transmississippi states, with a view of learning the drift of public opinion regarding active participation in the exposition by each of the states. These letters are being sent to the members at their homes.</p>
<p>Manager Reed of the department of concessions is being flooded with applications for space by manufacturers who desire to make an attractive display of their goods and sell their wares at the same time. Application has been made by one of the largest glass manufacturing establishments in this country and communications of a similar nature are received by every mail. Personal applications for concessions in the refreshment line are very numerous and Mr. Reed says his time is completely occupied in looking after these matters.</p></div2>

<p>South Omaha got another vigorous slap from the transmississippi directory last Saturday. Ever since Wakefield announced his intention to resign his place on the directory Hoctor has been skating on the ice of expectancy, and all his neighbors were sure he would win the successorship prize. But the ice was not strong enough to stand the weight of the portly commissioner, and, slipping through, he could do no better than win second place in the contest, his successful competitor, Rector, winning by nearly two to one.</p>

<p>Though the directors of the transmississippi congress kindly went through the formality of asking the people to submit bids on a site for the big show it believes among those who try to keep up with the inside procession of events, that the powers that be have long since decided where the exposition will be located, and the opening and consideration of the bids at the next meeting will be but a farce. When the B &amp; M pricked its bump of generosity, and let loose that $30,000 subscription the outside boys and many others, winked the other eye and said they knew the show would be anchored among the beauties of River Park as it is contrary to the laws of modern nature for such a road to be so magnanimous unless there's something in it, and the park was exactly the location that would bring all the returns it wanted. The law of nature and location elements of this speculation are dead right, but the remainder will be found to be out of plumb. Were the B &amp; M the only party in the deal the whole idea would be correct. But there are others. And these others are in it to an appreciable extent. To a man behind the footlights it looks as if the "others" were in it first. That they had arranged things so that the Burlington was forced to come in with a whopping donation as means of securing a compromise in the location of the site or rather to keep the show from going to Miller Park, where the others wanted it. And that before the B &amp; M put in a cent it was agreed to have the show put where all interests would have an equal chance to fry the fat out of it. There are not over forty-five other places that would liberally suit the interests of these opposing elements, and the most promising one of all is the ground, a part of which is now occupied by the poor farm. And that is the site the professedly knowing ones say is the place compromised on and that will be the scene of the great fair. If it is the Magic City will do no kicking. It appears to be located about right to let in the railroads and motors in good shape, and is surely satisfactory in the matter of convenience to all parts of the county.</p></div2>

<head type="main">WITHIN LETTER OF THE LAW</head>    
<head type="sub">WILL NOT NOTIFY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS</head>
<head type="sub">Omission of Exact Instructions from the Bill Serves as a Reason for Failure to Issue the Proclamation.</head>
    <div3>
<p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;President Cleveland will not issue a proclamation recognizing the Transmississippi and International Exposition. This fact was emphatically stated today by Private Secretary Thurber to The Bee correspondent.</p>    
<p>Mr. Thurber said that he had indicated the president's action in a letter to Representative Mercer, who had been most importunate in asking for executive action in regard to the formal recognition of the Exposition. The reason given for this refusal on the part of the executive is that the law does not indicate in any way that such recognition should be made on the part of the government of the United States, nor does it refer in any way to governmental sanction except as to the appointment of a United States commission having charge of the government exhibit and recognition of exhibition by an appropriation<choice><sic>..</sic><corr>.</corr></choice> This is thought to be a vital defect in the bill as passed at the last session of congress. An effort will undoubtedly be made upon the reconvening of congress to include in the amended bill the provision for the formal recognition on the part of the United States of the international character of the exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898. Secretary Thurber, in speaking of this matter, said:</p>
<p>"We have had a desire to favor Mr. Mercer as much as possible in this matter, but the president after reading the law saw that it was absolutely useless to formally indicate the character of the exposition to foreign governments unless there was an absolute stipulation that he should do so in the bill. He read up on other proclamations issued in behalf of expositions of past years&#8212;that of New Orleans, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Chicago, and found that all acts creating these expositions and investing them with governmental character had stipulated that the president should issue a proclamation to foreign governments to participate with the United States in such exposition, but that the Omaha bill was silent as to extending an invitation to foreign countries to display their wares at Omaha, and therefore he would not go beyond the direct features of the act."</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WILL NAME THE COMMISSION.</head>
<p>In all probability the president at the cabinet meeting tomorrow will call attention of the members of his official family to the act creating the Omaha Exposition and requiring each head of the executive department, the Smithsonian Institute and Fish commission to name a representative to the president, who will in turn appoint such representatives as members of the United States commission to have charge of the government exhibit at Omaha, and he will then name the chairman of the board. It was thought that the president would take his own good time to name this commission, but as he would like to have the whole matter cleared up before the expiration of his term of office, he will undoubtedly name the commission in the near future upon the suggestion of the cabinet officers interested in the various features, which, when assembled, will form the exhibit of the United States government.</p>
<p>Next Wednesday the ways and means committee will hear representatives of the sugar and molasses interests of the country for the purpose of aiding in the framing of a new tariff bill, which is <choice><sic>intrusted</sic><corr>entrusted</corr></choice> to that body, and which will be introduced shortly after the extra session is called. In addition to the beet sugar interests of Nebraska, there will be present representatives from other states, who propose to go into the business of raising sugar beets for manufacturing purposes. Louisiana and the south will also have strong representatives present, who will champion the cause of sugar cane and molasses schedule, and, according to Mr. Oxnard, who is now in the city, a most interesting session of the committee is looked for.</p>
<p>Secretary Thurber is authority for the statement that the president has not decided upon any course of action in the matter of foreclosure of the Union Pacific, Central Pacific and Kansas Pacific mortgage. Under the Thurman act there must be a breach of mortgage first before the executive can be called upon to act, and, that the executive will allow congress suitable time in which to pass any funding bill that it may see fit, or provide for the payment of the indebtedness due the government in some way that will not necessitate absolute foreclosure. Should, however, congress fail to take action in regard to the matter, it may confidentially be expected that within a very short time after the 15th of January there will come from the executive department of the government with the sanction of the attorney general, secretary of interior and others, directly interested, a proclamation foreclosing the mortgages and the roads will be sold under the hammer to the lowest bidders.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">CLEVELAND WILL MOVE SLOWLY.</head>
<p>"This is an exceedingly difficult question," said Mr. Thurber, "and the president means to move very slowly in the matter. He recognizes the absolute importance of the multiplicity of interests involved and he means to do nothing but what will be to the best interests of the government and to all parties concerned. There have been a number of conferences between the attorney general, secretary of war and others who have the matter in charge, but nothing definite, so far as I know, has come from these conferences, except that they will await a breach of mortgage, and this will not occur until after January 1, 1897."</p>
<p>Comptroller Eckels has approved the following reserve agents: Nebraska&#8212;First National bank, Omaha, for First National bank, O'Neill. Iowa&#8212;Union National bank, Omaha, for First National bank, Council Bluffs; Des Moines National bank, Des Moines, for Lemars National bank, Lemars; Metropolitan National bank, Chicago, for Ottumwa National bank, Ottumwa.</p></div3>

<head type="main">RAILROADS ARE INTERESTED</head>
<head type="sub">EXPOSITION OFFICIALS MUCH ENCOURAGED</head>
<head type="sub">Officers of the Various Roads Promise to Urge it Upon the Directors of Their Companies at the Annual Meetings.</head>
        <div3>
<p>A delegation of directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition returned yesterday morning from Chicago, where they went to hold a conference with the officials of the Omaha-Chicago railways with a view of securing substantial support from those roads in the way of subscriptions to stock of the exposition. Those in the party were Chairman Z. T. Lindsey of the executive committee, manager of the Department of Ways and Means; Edward Rosewater, manager of the Department of Publicity; Directors A. T. Rector, Lucius Wells of Council Bluffs and George F. Bidwell, general manager of the Fremont, Elkhorn &amp; Missouri Valley railway.</p>
<p>The delegation met the railway officials in the Auditorium annex and felt entirely satisfied with the result of their interview, which lasted several hours. The Chicago officials present were: President Marvin Hughitt and Third Vice President H. G. Burt of the Northwestern; President R. R. Cable of the Rock Island, and General Manager A. J. Earling of the Milwaukee road, President Miller of the latter road being confined to his room by serious illness.</p>
<p>Edward Rosewater stated, after his return home, that the interview with the railway officials had been most amicable and that the committee felt the roads would give the exposition substantial support. Mr. Rosewater said that President Hughlitt had given it as his opinion that the exposition was the most extensive and effective advertising scheme for the transmississippi region that had ever been devised and he promised to do all in his power to assist in pushing the matter to a successful issue. The president said that the directors of the Northwestern would meet next week, and he promised to lay the matter before them in its most favorable light.</p>
<p>President Cable promised the support of the Rock Island to the exposition, and said his road would subscribe liberally. He stated that the directors would probably meet in March next, and promised to lay the matter before them with his endorsement.</p>
<p>General Manager Earling of the Milwaukee, speaking for President Miller, said the matter would be taken up by the Milwaukee at the earliest practicable moment and would undoubtedly be given most favorable consideration.</p></div3>
        <div3>
<head type="sub">MANIFEST MUCH INTEREST</head>
<p>All of the Chicago officials manifested great interest in all of the details of the exposition so far as it has progressed, and asked innumerable questions which were satisfactorily answered by the committee. The officials were disposed to be noncommittal on the point whether the railroads would subscribe to the stock or make donations in aid of the exposition. They stated, however, that they had subscribed to stock in the World's fair and had received 42 per cent of their money in return when the affairs of the great exposition were settled.</p>
<p>While the committee of exposition officials was in Chicago a call was made upon Colonel Robert C. Clowry, vice president of the Western Union Telegraph company. Colonel Clowry is well known in Omaha, being a large holder of reality in this city, and he received the committee with great cordiality. He informed the committee that he had referred a letter from Mr. Rosewater to the officials of the telegraph company with his strongest endorsement and promised to do all in his power to secure a substantial subscription for exposition stock. Colonel Clowry was one of the active managers of the World's Fair, and told the committee that he had "been in the harness" for eighteen months. He gave his callers a number of most valuable points on the management of an exposition, and offered to supply any information in his power in that connection.</p>
<p>The committee returned to Omaha feeling greatly encouraged with the result of the trip and preparations are being made to secure interviews with the management of other great corporations which are expected to give the exposition substantial support in the way of liberal subscriptions.</p>
<p>Judge Neville of North Platte, vice president of the exposition for Nebraska, was in the city yesterday in conference with the Department of Promotion regarding the securing of a liberal appropriation from the legislature of this state. He was also in conference with officials of the exposition regarding a visit to other transmississippi states, where the judge has an extensive acquaintance.</p></div3>

<div2 type="article"><dateline>THE EVENING BEE: MONDAY, JANUARY 4, 1897.</dateline>    
<head type="sub">ENTHUSIASTIC FOR THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>Schuyler Herald: A liberal appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition can confidently be expected at the hands of the Nebraska legislature. That will be a practical way of standing up for Nebraska.</p>
<p>Blair Pilot: The Transmississippi Exposition booked to open in Omaha in June, 1898, should be the pride of every Nebraska citizen, and every Nebraskan should take pride in promoting the objects of the exposition.</p>
<p>Lincoln New Republic: The Transmississippi Exposition is ably started with a board of strong, energetic men who will make it a success. Everybody lend a helping hand. Drop politics and push for results which will help the northwest.</p>
<p>North Platte Tribune: If the incoming legislature does the proper thing it will lend encouragement to the beet sugar industry and appropriate a reasonable sum for the Transmississippi Exposition. Both mean much to this commonwealth.</p>
<p>Burchard Times: Now is a good time to work up the Transmississippi Exposition, which will be held at Omaha, June-November, 1898. Congress has pledged not less than $200,000, and almost $300,000 additional is contemplated. In addition to this there have been subscriptions and other appropriations which makes the sum total which will reach about $2,000,000. An exposition of this sort will call attention more forcibly to the western states and show their excellence and wealth.</p>
<p>North Nebraska Eagle: The Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha, beginning in June and ending in November in the year 1898, is already being pushed by its promoters. Subscriptions amounting to over $400,000 to its capital stock have already been secured and congress has pledged not less than $200,000 for a government exhibit. Nebraska will take great pride in this enterprise and nothing will be left undone by Nebraskans to make it a complete success.</p>
<p>Tobias Gazette: The Exposition will be a splendid advertisement for Nebraska and especially the city of Omaha. It is a worthy enterprise and every person that has the welfare of Nebraska at heart ought to aid it in every possible way. Congress has pledged not less than $200,000 and the state of Nebraska ought to aid it by a liberal appropriation. Let us not be penny wise and pound foolish in this matter, but stand up for Nebraska by lending aid. Success to the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
<p>North Bend Argus: The committees appointed to make arrangements for the great Transmississippi Exposition are now hard at work and nothing will be left undone to make the exposition a great success. Subscriptions amounting to over $400,000 have already been secured and congress has pledged not less than $200,000 more. The exposition will be a great advertisement for the whole transmississippi region, and especially Nebraska, and all Nebraskans should be ready to push it along.</p>
<p>Dodge Criterion: There seems to be a pretty general opinion among all classes of newspapers that the coming legislature should deal liberally with the Transmississippi Exposition and make an appropriation for an exhibition that will do justice to our growing state, and be in some measure commensurate with the great good the state will derive from the exposition. Nebraska cannot well afford to be parsimonious in this matter, and we hope to see her get to the front as she ought.</p>
<p>North Bend Republican: The committees appointed to make arrangements for the great Transmississippi Exposition are now hard at work and nothing will be left undone to make the exposition a great success. Subscriptions amounting to over $400,000 have already been secured, and congress has pledged not less than $200,000 more. The exposition will be a great advertisement for the whole Transmississippi region, and especially Nebraska and all Nebraskans should be ready to push it along.</p>    
<p>Bradshaw Republican: That the Transmississippi and International Exposition will be a success there is no longer any doubt. The Omaha people, backed by the able newspapers of the city, are putting forth an exhibition of energy that can only be fraught with great results. E. Rosewater, the indefatigable and energetic editor of The Omaha Bee, has been chosen to fill the responsible position of manager of the department of publicity. Every newspaper in Nebraska should step in line and stand up for Nebraska by saying a good work for the exposition.</p>
<p>St. Paul Republican: The management of the Transmississippi Exposition announces that over $400,000 in subscriptions to the capital stock has been raised from private sources, which, together with the $200,000 pledged by congress for a government exhibit, makes a very respectable financial beginning for the big show of '98. It will not be to Nebraska's interest to act niggardly in this matter, which means so much to her in the advertising of her resources, and it will devolve upon the coming legislature to make a liberal appropriation in order that the state may be properly represented.</p>
<p>North Bend Argus: The Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held in Omaha June to November of 1898 is now under way for a successful end. Over $400,000 has been subscribed by Omaha people and Secretary Carlisle had made the congressional appropriation of $200,000 available. There is no question of the benefits of this international exhibition, and the projectors are entitled to due credit. Nebraska will take pride in joining with her sister states in making an exhibit that will at once prove beyond the question of doubt her resources as one of the best states in the union. Success to the exposition is hoped for and is already assured.</p>
<p>Osceola Democrat: The Transmississippi Exposition department of publicity and promotion is already at work and from reports receive the indications are that there will not be a single state west of the Missouri river that will not make the necessary provision to take part in the great Nebraska enterprise. It is the duty of the department referred to to see that every state is in line with the necessary exhibits and representation. One manner in which the people of this estate can assist in furthering the success of this great affair is by corresponding with their friends and sending out such advertising matter as may be prepared. Let all put a shoulder to the wheel.</p>
    <p>Blair Courier: Since the first whisperings of a Transmississippi Exposition, to be held at Omaha, came to our ears, we have been heartily in favor of the project, and now when it is no longer a project, but an assured fact, with $400,000 subscribed by the citizens of Omaha and $200,000 pledged by congress, we wish to call the attention of the legislators from this county to the benefits <choice><sic>accuring</sic><corr>occurring</corr></choice> to the state from such an exposition and the necessity of an appropriation from the state legislature. Nebraska stands with noble mien in the center of the richest country in the world, and a successful exposition in 1898 will allow her radiance to shine grandly out over her sister states and to command the attention of the entire world.</p>
<p>Alma Reporter: The Transmississippi Exposition is now an assured fact, and everybody may begin to arrange for a visit to Omaha in 1898. The subscriptions to stock amount to over $400,000 and congress has already pledged $200,000 for a government exhibit, so the big exposition is assured. Of course the legislature will recognize the necessity for making an appropriation that our own state shall be credibly represented at home. Everything indicates an Exposition excelling any other ever held in the union, except indeed the great World's fair, and every loyal Nebraskan will lend a hand to make it the crowning success of this glorious nineteenth century of the wonderful development of western interests and resources.</p>
<p>Lincoln News: The Transmississippi Exposition has passed that stage where it was but a probability. It is now practically an assured enterprise. The citizens of Omaha have demonstrated their faith in the success and value of the exposition by subscribing for $400,000 stock, and congress has pledged not less than $200,000 for a government exhibit. It now remains for the state, through its legislature, to make an appropriation as large as the financial condition of the people will permit, and not only that, but her business men outside of Omaha should help by stock subscriptions. This is an enterprise that is not for the exclusive benefit of Omaha. An exposition of the scope and character of the one projected by the management is sure to be of incalculable benefit to the state and the mid-west generally. It will be an exposition of the resources and capabilities of this great transmississippi region that will repay many times the cost. Although Inaugurated in the midst of a depression that has taken the winter will be asked for an appropriation necessary to make a suitable showing. We believe our representatives fully realize the advantages to be derived and look with favor on the proposed exposition. The action of Nebraska will have great influence with the other transmississippi states. Let every citizen of Nebraska take a personal interest in this matter and do all they can to assist this great enterprise that means so much to her people.</p>
<p>Hastings Tribune: The Transmississippi Exposition, to be held at Omaha in 1898, bids fair to be one of the best exhibits of its kind ever attempted. All of the transmississippi states should, and probably will, participate in this exposition; and as for Nebraska, nothing could be more beneficial to her various interests than a successful consummation of the contemplated exposition. The people of this state, especially those who are financially interested, will make no mistake if generous support is given toward the carrying on of this work; and no citizen of Nebraska who is proud of his state will refuse or neglect to give the undertaking at least his moral support. The press of the state will no doubt do its full share in keeping the matter before the world by giving it the widest publicity possible. Sketches and letters descriptive of the various features of the exposition will appear in the columns of this paper later on and no doubt will prove interesting reading to our patrons.</p>

<pb n="17" xml:id="TMISB02-017"/>


<p>Kearney Hub: Edward Rosewater, editor of the Omaha Bee, having been appointed manager of the department of publicity of the Transmississippi Exposition, issues a circular letter to the press inviting newspaper co-operation in making known the scope of the enterprise and the advantages that must accrue to the states west of the Mississippi through the holding of the exposition. Mr. Rosewater's request will have a hearty response. He is one of the best known men in the west, and one of the best fitted for the position, and the work that has been given over to his management and supervision will be well done in every particular. When it is understood that the country west of the Mississippi comprises about two-thirds of the area of the country, and that is possesses all the elements of wealth necessary to make it as nearly independent of any other section, as one country can be independent of another, it will be realized that there are great possibilities in the coming exposition, which will be more nearly national than any heretofore held in the United States, aside from the Centennial exposition and the World's fair.</p>
<p>O'Neill Frontier: Nebraska as a whole is justly proud of the efforts now being put forth in behalf of the Transmississippi Exposition, to be held at Omaha in 1898. The work of organization has been completed and perfected, congress has pledged a handsome government display to the amount of $200,000, the capital stock is being rapidly subscribed for, different states are making appropriations commensurate to the character of the exposition, and it now remains for the Nebraska legislature to make a handsome appropriation to help represent our great and varied industries, and the success of the show will be assured. What the World's Fair was to Chicago the Transmississippi Exposition will be to Omaha and Nebraska. A glance at the personnel of the men at the head of the enterprise alone guarantees its success, especially the department of publicity and promotion, which is presided over by Hon. E. Rosewater of The Bee. The success of The Omaha Bee is a striking example of the ability of Mr. Rosewater in this direction, which alone would insure the success of any enterprise with which he is associated.</p>
<p>York Times: Omaha people are making a great effort to make the Transmississippi Exposition a success. They are taking hold of the scheme with energy and great liberality. The entire west is concerned in the project, but Nebraska will be more immediately and directly benefited than any other state, and the people of the entire commonwealth should second the efforts of the metropolis with zeal and earnestness. Omaha should not hesitate to give the invitation to the state, and we believe the response will be all that could be asked. The impression should not be allowed to obtain that it is an Omaha project or that the entire management is to be in that city. Suitable men from all parts of the state should be at once called into assist and should be aroused in as many localities as possible. An appropriation should be made by the legislature, not for Omaha, but for Nebraska, and the enterprising people of the state should see to it that it is as liberal as the times and the financial condition of the state will allow. Omaha is doing all it can of itself, and it only remains now for the people of that city to enlist immediately as many influential men in other parts of Nebraska as they possibly can. It's a good thing. Push it along.</p>
<p>Pawnee Press: The Transmississippi and International Exposition, to be held in Omaha from June to November, 1898, is an event in which all Nebraskans feel a keen interest. The success of the enterprise is an assured fact. Omaha people have subscribed liberally to the undertaking&#8212;in amount over $400,000&#8212;and congress has pledged not less than $200,000 for a government exhibit. Whatever tends to the upbuilding of Nebraska as a whole is worthy the undivided support of all our people. In this connection to know that all citizens of the state are enlisting their co-operation in the important event. The coming legislature should be as liberal as possible with an appropriation for a creditable exhibition of the resources of Nebraska, which will be returned tenfold through the judicious advertising that will result from such exhibition. Sketches and letters descriptive of the various features of the exhibition will be published in the Press from time to time, in order that our readers may acquaint themselves with the scope of the enterprise and the advantages that will ultimately accrue to the states west of the Mississippi, and especially to Nebraska.</p>
<p>Lincoln Call: Through various kinds of adversity, no state in the union has lost more than Nebraska. One of the most substantial measures of restoring confidence among the people and in the resources of this state is the Transmississippi Exposition. Subscriptions to the amount of $400,000 have already been secured and congress has pledged not less than $200,000 for the government exhibit. In this connection it is urged that the coming session of the legislature do the proper thing so far as a state exhibit is concerned. It is well known that the several transmississippi states will vie with each other as to the exhibition of their resources, and that Nebraska, being the chief promoter and the present home of the exhibition, the center of all attractions during a considerable period of time, it becomes imperative that the Nebraska state exhibit be second to none, and that in every particular with legislature and the people be found wanting in nothing that will inspire all the west to make the Transmississippi Exposition one worthy of the genius and energy which has led the course of empire beyond the Father of Waters. It should be remembered that there are many owners of Nebraska property who no longer reside here who should, nevertheless, interest themselves in the successful representation of Nebraska and her interests at Omaha in '98. Besides, it is none too early for every traveler from this state and every social and business letter that leaves it to carry abroad some pleasurable information or solicitation relative to the exposition. No such opportunity has ever been given to stand by and to stand up for Nebraska. What are our people going to do about it?</p>
<p>Seward Reporter: The board of managers of the Transmississippi Exposition has been duly constituted, and efficient men have been put at the head of the various departments. These men have been selected from the leading business men of Omaha, men who have demonstrated their ability in business affairs requiring great capacity, and under such management there can be no doubt of the success of the exposition. Subscriptions have been received amounting to $400,000, and the government has pledged $200,000 to make a national exhibit. The great benefit which Nebraska will receive from this exposition can hardly be estimated. While it is not and will not be a Nebraska affair wholly, this state will be more largely benefited than any other part of the great northwest, which is interested in the exposition. It is much to be hoped that the Nebraska legislature will see this matter in its true light, and appreciate the importance of a liberal appropriation. Other states in the contiguous territory will be asked to participate, and in order to secure their hearty co-operation Nebraska must manifest her own interest in the matter. This is not a question of politics or partisanship, but a question of business for the state, and every member of the legislature should feel a personal interest in the exposition, and give his assistance in putting Nebraska in the right attitude. Beyond question every dollar spent by the state in the exposition will be returned many times, and a liberal appropriation will be a judicious investment. It is a matter in which every citizen of the state is interested. The success of the exposition will be of the greatest benefit to Nebraska, and Nebraska should ungrudgingly invest a sum of money sufficient, with the other guaranteed assistance, to make it a success. </p>
<p>Herman Review: Omaha, as the center of the coming Transmississippi Exposition, occupies a similar position which attended the building of the Columbian exposition. On the business men and people of that city the ultimate success of the Transmississippi Exposition depends and much depends in getting all sections of the United States interested in its behalf, so as to make Omaha worthy of the honor which she boldly aspires to, aided by the great Mississippi valley, in promoting so important an industrial exposition in which each and all may share a part in its history. A large amount of money has already been subscribed by the Omaha business men, and an appropriation has been made by congress for the purpose of helping to promote the affair. The name Transmississippi means more than a single state or two of three states; it means in reality not only the whole of the broad Mississippi valley, but likewise the far west, clear to the Pacific coast. To provide for the millions of people from such a vast scope of country who will visit the exposition in the season of 1898 must necessarily prompt the promoting at the start of wide special interest among exhibitors and concessionaires in order to make it attractive and of benefit to the public, as well as a financial success. Omaha is deserving of much credit for the effort it is thus early putting forth in this direction. In the election of its local board of directors, many of the strongest and most influential men have been chosen. The Transmississippi Exposition means a great deal in the near future for Omaha and its environments. In connection with the preliminary work which has just begun every laudable effort should also be made to impress the importance of the coming exposition on the mind of the public, and the incalculable benefit which must certainly accrue to the Mississippi valley and its tributaries in still further developing the richest agricultural and stock raising district on the North American continent. Splendid as have been the achievements of Omaha in the past in promoting enterprises of business and commercial value in this part of the west, the magnitude and conception of what the Transmississippi Exposition promises in the way of a display of the ingenuity of master minds is bound to surpass all former enterprises ever held in the United States, and in point of magnificent splendor take rank with the famed Columbian exposition of 1893.</p>
<p>O'Neill Sun: The Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898 will doubtless be second to the World's fair held at Chicago. Over $400,000 of capital stock has already been subscribed and congress has pledged not less than $200,000 for a government exhibit. Every citizen of the state should take an interest as well as pride in having his county thoroughly advertised at the exposition with the best exhibits that can be had. Boards of supervisors should devise some means whereby their counties may make a proper showing, and the legislature should not be backward in making a fitting appropriation for a state display as well as to offer some inducements to county exhibits. Subcommittees in each county, to work in conjunction with the Board of Managers, might also prove of benefit.</p>
    <p>Neligh Yeoman: The Transmississippi Exposition projected for 1898 at Omaha, Neb., must inspire a just pride in the people of the whole country, but particularly those of the great west, and especially the people of Nebraska. Four hundred thousand dollars have already been subscribed to its capital stock and congress has pledged $200,000 for a government exhibit. A large additional sum will be needed to carry out the program on the grand scale which is intended. This exhibition is designed to surpass in <choice><sic>grandure</sic><corr>grandeur</corr></choice> and completeness anything of the kind yet undertaken in the country. It will be the grandest display of American skill and enterprise ever witnessed in America. Favored as we are by this first great Transmississippi Exposition, we are placed under weighty obligations to lend our best efforts to make the undertaking a brilliant success.</p>
<p>Tekamah Herald: Every Nebraskan will take great pride in the Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha during the summer of 1898. It will be to Nebraska and the Transmississippi territory what the World's fair was to Chicago and Illinois. The preliminary work for the exposition is now under full headway. Local subscriptions have already been secured to the amount of $400,000 and congress has appropriated $200,000 with promises of more. Appropriations by the different states will swell the amount of money to be expended to fully $2,000,000. The benefits this great exposition will be to Nebraska cannot at this time be calculated, and Nebraska should show the interest it takes in it by appropriating, at the coming session of the legislature, a sum sufficient to make the Nebraska exhibit the pride of all Nebraskans. Let our own state do the handsome thing and neighboring states will fall in line with liberal appropriations.</p>
<p>Creighton News: The committee having charge of the Transmississippi Exposition is making rapid progress. Four hundred thousand dollars have been raised by donation from the citizens of Nebraska and the legislature will undoubtedly make an appropriation for the promotion of such a worthy cause. The citizens of Nebraska should feel proud of the fact that such a grand exhibition will be held within the state; Nebraska will be the center of attraction during the coming years. People who visit the exposition cannot help but look with pride as they pass over the state, at the fertile plains, beautiful valleys, magnificent churches and temples of learning dotted here and there, and when they gaze with admiration at the wonderful advancement Omaha has made within the past few years, which is only an index of the advancement of the state at large, they will feel like taking up their abode among us, and live in a state that is soon to be the pride of the nation.</p></div2>
    
<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">RACE MEETINGS FOR THE SUMMER.</head>    
<head type="sub">Events Arranged For, but Size of Purses Undecided.</head>
<p>The details of the race meetings of the coming summer at Omaha, St. Joe and Lincoln were partially arranged at a meeting held at the Millard hotel yesterday afternoon. Palmer L. Clark represented the St. Joe association and D. T. Mount the Omaha organization. Morris Jones of Red Oak, Ia., and representatives from Lincoln, were also present. After some discussion the following events were agreed on, for which purses will be offered: Trotting, 3:00, 2:40, 2:30, 2:22, 2:17, 2:12, and a free-for-all for 3-year-olds in the 2:25 class.</p>
<p>There was some discussion in regard to the amount of the purses to be offered. The St. Joe and Lincoln people wanted the purses fixed at $600 in each event, but the Omaha representatives favored a higher purse. The matter was left partially undecided, but the purses will be fixed at somewhere between $600 and $1,000</p>
<p>The date of the Omaha meeting was also left for future consideration. Omaha can have either the week beginning June 8, or that beginning June 29. The meetings at St. Joe and Lincoln will be held between the two dates mentioned.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">ENTHUSIASTIC FOR THE EXPOSITION</head>
<p>Ogalalla News: Every newspaper in Nebraska should lend all possible aid in support of the Transmississippi and International Exposition. It will be second only to the World's fair of any similar exposition ever held.</p>
<p>Gretna Reporter: Now for a Transmississippi Exposition. A long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together will make it the greatest show ever held in America outside of Chicago in 1893. Put your shoulder to the wheel.</p>
<p>Nebraska's City Press: The state legislature will convene in regular session next Monday. The first thing the legislature should do after organization should be to make a splendid appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
<p>Emerson Enterprise: The Transmississippi and International Exposition which will be held in Omaha next year will be a grand show and great thing for Nebraska. Subscriptions amounting to about $500,000 have already been secured and the national government will contribute $200,000 more. The state legislature should make liberal appropriations and all the people of the state assist in making it a success.</p>
<p>Burchard Times: Now is a good time to work up the Transmississippi Exposition which will be held at Omaha, June-November, 1898. Congress has pledged not less than $200,000, and almost $300,000 additional is contemplated. In addition to this there have been subscriptions and other appropriations which makes the sum total which it will reach about $2,000,000. An exposition of this sort will call attention more forcibly to the western states and show their excellence and wealth.</p>
<p>Platte Center Signal: The Transmississippi Exposition is being engineered forward by the most enterprising and successful business element of the state. Nebraska should come forward with a liberal appropriation for this grand scheme in order that we may look forward with pride to the year 1898, when our state will demonstrate to the world at large that its industrial development is only excelled by our wonderful natural resources for agricultural purposes, which makes Nebraska truly "The garden spot of America."</p>
<p>Dixon Tribune: The Transmississippi Exposition is an assured success. Omaha has raised its little $400,000 and congress will appropriate at least $200,000 for a government exhibit. Almost every state in the union will appropriate a nice sum and be represented and Nebraska should not be laggard in this matter. It is the one chance in a lifetime to advertise Nebraska. Let the legislature this winter not be "pennywise and pound foolish," but appropriate such a sum that will give Nebraska an exhibit such as has never been seen before. Nebraska is all right.</p>
<p>Fairfield Herald: The Transmississippi Exposition is already full-fledged, subscriptions to the amount of $400,000 having been already secured and a government appropriation of $200,000 already made. It now remains for the coming legislature of Nebraska to make a liberal appropriation to keep it moving and to show the implicit faith in the enterprise. A number of states have already made appropriations. It will certainly be of great benefit to the entire west, but to no state more than our own. Keep Nebraska to the front for a successful exposition at Omaha in 1898.</p>
<p>North Bend Argus: The Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held in Omaha, June to November of 1898, is now under way for a successful end. Over $400,000 has been subscribed by Omaha people, and Secretary Carlisle had made the congressional appropriation of $200,000 available. There is no question of the benefits of this international exposition, and the projectors are entitled to due credit. Nebraska will take pride in joining with her sister states in making an exhibit that will at once prove beyond the question of doubt her resources as one of the best states in the union. Success to the exposition is hoped for and is already assured.</p>
<p>Nebraska City Press: The Transmississippi Exposition is no longer a probability, but an assured fact. The citizens of Omaha have fulfilled every pledge made to congress and the board of managers is composed of Omaha's most prominent and worthy citizens. The various managers have been selected with a view of their special fitness or qualification for the department over which each will preside. The selection of Hon. Edward Rosewater as manager of the department of publicity heads the list of wise selections and the newspapers of Nebraska will rally to his support in making the exposition one of the grandest successes ever achieved in the exposition line.</p>
<p>Waterloo Gazette: The Board of Managers of the Transmississippi Exposition has got down to business and progress is being made every day to make a grand success of this exposition. Congress has pledged not less than $200,000 for a government exhibit, and Omaha has already secured $400,000 in subscriptions to its capital stock. We hope that our state legislature will add dignity to Nebraska's fame by granting a liberal donation for a magnificent display of the products of our great commonwealth at this time of abundance of crops and assured return of financial prosperity. Hur-<unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> ran for the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha, 1898. Neighboring states are arranging to assist in this gigantic enterprise, and Omaha will be the site for a "world's fair" on a grand scale.</p>
<p>Lincoln State Journal: The prospects for the Transmississippi Exposition are brightening and though some local prejudice creeps out here and there the interest in the enterprise is growing and there is little doubt if the people of this state give the proper aid and encouragement the exposition will be a great success and will be of immense value to Nebraska and the states surrounding it in attracting the attention of capital and removing the temporary odium that sundry crop failures and political breaks in consequence have thrown upon the Transmississippi region. It behooves every Nebraskan to stir himself in behalf of the exposition and to see to it that a proper recognition be accorded it by the state authorities and a generous appropriation be granted by the legislature. It is one of those things that we cannot afford to ignore. It must not be permitted to fail.</p>
<p>Schuyler Sun: Every true Nebraska citizen should take an active interest in the Transmississippi Exposition of 1898, and in every way possible do that which will tend to insure success. The advantages to the state in general and the citizens as individuals can not be overestimated. Both directly and indirectly the benefits will be felt over the entire state. The other states represented will also come in for their share, but to Nebraska additional advantages are lent from the fact that it is to occur within our own borders, and on our own soil visitors from the east stop. It depends in a great measure upon the impression received whether or not there visitors will care to make any investigation. If a general debilitated aspect hangs over the exposition the effects will be more detrimental than though no exposition were held. Yet if an air of thrift, industry, wideawake business activity is maintained, if eastern visitors are given to understand that Nebraska is not the "great American desert," but a prosperous and active commonwealth, anxious and ready to do her part in the great economy of the nation, success will be assured and benefits will accrue in proportion. It then behooves every citizen of the state to constitute himself a committee of one to talk for the great interoceanic fair.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">He Tells How Foreign Nations May Be Officially Notified.</head>
<p>Last night's mail from the east brought to President Wattles of the Transmississippi Exposition a letter from Secretary of State Olney, relative to the issuance of an official notice of the holding of the exposition in this city in 1898.</p>
<p>Some time ago when it was discovered that the bill authorizing the holding of the exposition did not contain any provision for the notification of foreign countries, President Wattles took the matter up with Secretary Olney and requested some information upon what he considered a proper course of procedure. In writing to President Wattles, Secretary Olney suggests that when the proper times comes, the officers of the exposition association shall notify the Department of State, which department in turn will formally invite all nations with which the United States has diplomatic relations to participate in the exposition and place exhibits. The secretary writes that by following this course, the exposition will be given as much publicity as though the notification came through the president of the United States or through congress.</p>
<p>President Wattles of the Transmississippi Exposition association and Manager Hitchcock of the Bureau of Promotion, attended the meeting of the Woman's club yesterday. called for the purpose of devising ways and means to secure representation upon the exposition board. Owing to the stormy condition of the weather, and the small attendance, the members of the club postponed action until the meeting that will be held on January 18. In an informal way, at the meeting held yesterday, Messrs. Wattles and Hitchcock advised the members of the club to formulate some plan indicating what they wanted, and submit it to the exposition directors, at which time it would receive consideration.</p></div2>

<ab>St. Louis Republic.</ab>
<p>Omaha is vigorously preparing its Transmississippi and International Exposition for 1898. Since it is the first great exposition attempted beyond the Missouri, all the western states will lend their warm interest and best efforts in aid of the Omaha enterprise. The Nebraska legislature will appropriate $250,000, this winter. With the appropriation by congress, the funds will be ample for an elaborate affair. The Omaha exposition will be one of the marked features of next year.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">EXPOSITION COMMITTEE MEETS.</head>
<head type="sub">Action on Bids for Rooms for Headquarters Postponed.</head>
<p>The executive committee of the Transmississippi and International Exposition association held a special meeting this noon at the Commercial club rooms for the purpose of acting on the bids for rooms for headquarters, which were opened at the last meeting and referred to a committee. On account of the absence of Mr. Bruce, one of the special committee, however, no action was taken on the bids, the matter being postponed until the regular meeting on Saturday of this week.</p>
<p>President Wattles was requested to confer with C. S. Montgomery, the <choice><sic>leagl</sic><corr>legal</corr></choice> advisor of the board, regarding the powers of the state, county and city to make appropriations in support of the exposition.</p>
<p>A letter was read from the British vice consul at Kansas City, asking for full information regarding the exposition for incorporation in his regular annual report to his government. The matter was referred to the department of publicity.</p>
<p>Manager Hitchcock, for the Department of Promotion, reported favorable progress in the work of his department and asked authority to employ one additional typewriter. The request was granted.</p>
<p>President Wattles read a letter received from Secretary Olney of the Department of State, relating to an announcement through the State Department to foreign governments regarding the <choice><sic>xposition</sic><corr>exposition</corr></choice>. The secretary expressed his willingness to do all in his power in the matter and enclosed a long list of the official titles of the various foreign potentates for use in addressing communications to their highnesses.

<p>The form of blank application for space and the rules to govern exhibitors and concessionaires were referred to the Department of Publicity in conjunction with the Department of Exhibits and Concessions for revision.</p>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">Dream Brought Tears.</head>    
<p>OMAHA, Jan. 4.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: As a subscriber to the Transmississippi fund I have a little interest in its location. And after reading a communication from the poor farm committee to locate it there, I went to bed and soon fell asleep and began to dream. I seemed to see a large crowd of people assembled in a large room discussing its location. Some wanted it in one place some in another. I thought of the miserable location of our fair grounds, way out of our city among the hills,and wondered if the committee would lose sight of the general interest of the city and the location of the grounds in order to grind somebody's axe. Just then I began to cry, and I did cry and sob as though my heart would break, knowing there were such good grounds right on the borders of the city which could be had, and buildings built for the government and all improvements made could be left for future use if desired. Here I woke up, comforting myself with the fact that it was a dream and the dreadful calamity of locating it elsewhere had not come upon us yet, nor would it whilst its location is in the hands of such wise men.</p>

<p>Dorchester Star: The board of directors of the Transmississippi Exposition has been selected, chiefs of the various bureaus have been appointed, and the work of pushing forward the enterprise will at once begin.</p>
<p>Bellwood Gazette: The Transmississippi Exposition to be held in our metropolis, June to November, 1898, promises to be a grand thing for Nebraska and all the states near her. No pains should be spared on the part of the citizens of our fair state to make the big show a phenomenal success.</p>
<p>Monroe Republican: Omaha's Transmississippi Exposition should be given a liberal appropriation by the legislature. Money put into an enterprise of this kind is not thrown away, but will in time bring a big return in the shape of new enterprises and a further development of the resources of the state.</p>
<p>Monroe Looking Glass: The Transmississippi Exposition is making good progress. They have already secured $400,000 in subscriptions to its capital stock, and E. Rosewater, manager of the department of publicity, states that congress has pledged not less than $200,000. No doubt this will be a large thing for Nebraska. Especially will this prove true should the new system of soil culture be so successful as to demonstrate the capabilities of our state to sustain a dense population in our western portion. At least it will help to acquaint the country with our advantages for the relocation of the national capitol upon our broad plains.</p>
<p>Plainview Gazette: The Transmississippi Exposition in Omaha in 1898 promises to be a fair on a truly magnificent scale. Subscriptions have been secured for its capital stock amounting to over $400,000. Congress has appropriated $200,000 for a government exhibit, and there is some prospect of this amount being increased. The fair will be one of the best possible advertisements of the resources of the west, and the states interested will doubtless take pains to make creditable displays. Nebraska should be second to no state in the list, and the legislature, as well as individuals, should extend the greatest possible encouragement to the enterprise.</p>
<p>Madison Chronicle: The Transmississippi Exposition which is to be held in Omaha in 1898 will be the grandest advertisement for Nebraska ever vouchsafed our people, and every citizen of the state should constitute himself a committee of one to further the efforts of the managers in bringing it to a grand and successful issue. Over $400,000 has already been subscribed, and the government has pledged $200,000 more for a government exhibit. Mr. E. Rosewater, editor of The Omaha Bee, has been appointed manager of the department of publicity, which is a guaranty that the details of thoroughly advertising the exposition will be carefully looked after.</p>
<p>Steele City Standard: The Transmississippi Exposition is just now attracting the attention of all who are interested in Nebraska. The subscriptions now amount to over $400,000, congress is pledged for not less than $200,000 more, and the exposition promises to be second in magnificence only to the World's Fair. Every Nebraskan should consider himself a committee of one to further the interests of the undertaking, as all will be benefited by the attracting of a large number of people to the state and their consequent knowledge of the advantage of settlement here. Information regarding the matter will appear in these columns from time to time in the future.</p>
<p>Brownell Mascot: Don't forget the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held in Omaha from June to November, 1898. The date is a good ways in the future, to be sure, but there is a whole lot to do in getting ready to accommodate and entertain the vast number of people who will visit Nebraska during the exposition. The exposition <choice><sic>asosciation</sic><corr>association</corr></choice> has already secured subscriptions amounting to $400,000, and congress has promised not less than $200,000 for a government exhibit. It is now in order for the Nebraska legislature, as representing the wishes of the people of the state, to make a liberal appropriation to help make the exposition a success.</p>
<p>Pierce County Leader: The Transmississippi Exposition is now the leading topic for discussion among Nebraskans, and it should be, for the 1898 exhibition will be a great advertisement for Nebraska. Over $400,000 have already been subscribed, and congress has pledged not less than $200,000 for a government exhibit. Concerted action on the part of citizens of Nebraska will advance the interests of the enterprise to a high degree, and by booming this project properly Nebraska will acquire a worldwide reputation for thrift and industry unparalleled in American history. Stand up and work for the exposition, and by so doing you stand up for the garden spot of the universe&#8212;Nebraska.</p>
<p>Fremont Herald: Long strides are being made by the officers in charge toward the ultimate success of the 1898 Transmississippi Exposition, which is to be held at Omaha. This enterprise will not alone prove of great benefit to Nebraska metropolis, but to the state and district at large. It will attract national attention to our resources, and every indication is that it will be the introducing of a reign of genuine prosperity, which will be duly appreciated. We are pleased to observe Editors Hitchcock and Rosewater working hand-in-hand in this cause, each being chairman of responsible committees, and will agree that any one who shirks his duty toward this 1898 fair is not worthy of Nebraska citizenship. Good progress is reported from headquarters.</p>
<p>Hildreth Telescope: The coming session of the Nebraska legislature will be called upon to make an appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898, and it is to be earnestly hoped that it will be a liberal one. Over $400,000 has already been secured in subscriptions to its capital stock, and congress has appropriated $200,000 to make a government exhibit, and now it remains for Nebraska to do the right thing. It will be the poorest kind of economy for our legislature to refuse to make a liberal appropriation. We may never again have such an opportunity to show to the world the vast resources of our great commonwealth. Every Nebraskan who loves his state and takes pride in her development will take off his coat and do everything in his power to make the Transmississippi Exposition in 1898 a grand success in every respect.</p>
<p>Crete Vidette: The exposition of 1898 promises to be to Omaha and Nebraska what the Columbian Exposition was to Chicago and Illinois. Located in the center of the greatest corn belt in the world, and upon the edge of what was once termed the American desert, thousands of people in the eastern states will take advantage of the low rates and visit our state next year. If properly advertised in the south more people from that section will visit Nebraska next year than have ever been upon her fertile soil. The enterprising citizens of Omaha have already contributed $400,000 to its capital stock and congress has pledged not less than $300,000 more. The various legislatures this winter will make liberal appropriations and an exhibit of western enterprise will be given commensurate with our great resources. This is a natural enterprise at our very door and should enlist the hearty co-operation of every citizen of the commonwealth. Let no effort be spared to make the Transmississippi Exposition a grand success.</p>
<p>Elmwood Leader-Echo: The Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha, beginning in June and ending in November, 1898, deserves the hearty support and co-operation of every resident of Nebraska; for, by our hearty support we will draw the other western states more closely into the project. There has been already subscribed over $400,000 of capital, and congress has pledged not less than $200,000 for a government exhibit. Surely this will be a wonderful thing for Nebraska, and the results to our state financially would be inestimable. Nebraska is a glorious state and the more nearly the people of the cast are brought into contact with us the faster we will gain in population and capitalists to invest in the development of this grand state. We take pleasure in heartily endorsing this grand move and hope the people of the west will feel it their duty, as well as their pleasure, to aid in this project as much as is in their power. Nebraska and its citizens ought to, and we feel sure they will, take pride in this exposition and do all in their power to make it a grand success. Now, dear readers, let us put on our Sunday clothes and show the people of the east that we are a generous and hospital people. Let us all contribute what we can and do all that lies in our power toward forwarding this grand enterprise. Your farm products will be in demand and the value of your property and farms will be enhanced by this great gathering of people in our midst.</p></div2>

<p>The receivers of the Union Pacific were in session again his morning and were busily engaged the entire morning with routine matters of the company. The union depot matter was not touched upon. Chairman Z. T. Lindsey of the Ways and Means bureau of the exposition appeared before them an requested a hearing for a delegation from the exposition directory. It was decided that the delegation should be met this afternoon at 3 o'clock. At that time the Union Pacific receivers will be formally asked to contribute their share toward the exposition.</p>
<p>President Clark, General Manager Dickinson and the receivers will go west to Salt Lake City tomorrow morning in a special train of three cars. There they will attend the foreclosure sale of the Oregon Short Line and Utah Northern.

<head type="sub">ENTHUSIASTIC FOR THE EXPOSITION</head>
<p>Surprise Herald: The Transmississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898 is fast getting into shape. The Omaha people have subscribed $400,000 to its capital stock, congress has donated $200,000 and in all probabilities our coming legislature will vote a liberal appropriation for the exhibition. This exposition will certainly be of great benefit to our state in general. It will bring people and money into our state and, indirectly, we will all be benefited. We think the exposition should receive the hearty co-operation of all Nebraska people and we believe it will.</p>
<p>Fairfield News-Herald: The Transmississippi Exposition is already full-fledged, subscriptions to the amount of $400,000 having been already secured, and a government appropriation of $200,000 already made. It now remains for the coming legislature of Nebraska to make a liberal appropriation to keep it moving and to show the implicit faith in the enterprise. A number of states have already made appropriations. It will certainly be of great benefit to the entire west, but to no state more than our own. Keep Nebraska to the front for a successful exposition at Omaha in 1898.</p>
<p>Hildreth Telescope: The coming session of the Nebraska legislature will be called upon to make an appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898, and it is to be earnestly hoped that it will be a liberal one. Over $400,000 has already been secured in subscriptions to its capital stock and congress has appropriated $200,000 to make a government exhibit, and now it remains for Nebraska to do the right thing. It will be the poorest kind of economy for our legislature to refuse to make a liberal appropriation. We may never again have such an opportunity to show to the world the vast resources of our great commonwealth. Every Nebraska who loves his state and takes pride in her development will take off his coat and do everything in his power to make the Transmississippi Exposition in 1898 a grand success in every respect.</p>
<p>Dawson Newsboy: Transmississippi Exposition, to be held at Omaha, Neb., in 1898, bids fair to be one of the beset exhibits of its kind ever attempted. All of the transmississippi states should, and probably will, participate in this exposition; and as for Nebraska nothing could be more beneficial to her various interests than a successful consummation of the contemplated exposition. The people of this state, especially such who are financially interested will make no mistake if generous support is given toward the carrying on of this work; and no citizen of Nebraska who is proud of his state will refuse or neglect to give the undertaking at least his moral support. The press of the state will no doubt do its full share in keeping the matter before the world by giving it the wildest publicity possible. Sketches and letters descriptive of the various features of the exposition will appear in the columns of this paper later on, and no doubt will prove interesting reading to our patrons.</p>
<p>Battle Creek Republican: The Transmississippi Exposition will mean much for Nebraska, as well as all the states in the transmississippi region. But as it is to be held in Omaha, it is particularly important that Nebraska should lead out with as liberal inducements as she can afford. Other states will follow her example when they become fully aware of the vast benefit that will inevitably follow an exposition of such broad environment. People from the east and south will be attracted to this country with their money. They will see the biggest and best field for investment on earth. They will invest, and likely kick themselves for not coming sooner and taking advantage of a good thing. Foreign countries will be invited to participate in the exposition, and it will be little less than a World's fair if the intentions of its promoters are successfully carried out. Subscriptions amounting to over $400,000 are already secured, and congress has pledged not less than $200,000 for a government exhibit.</p>
<p>Bloomington Echo: It is with considerable pleasure that the Echo notes the great progress that is being made in the initiatory work of the Transmississippi Exposition, to be held in Omaha. Already subscriptions of over $400,000 have been secured, together with the sum of $200,000 appropriated by the government, is a guaranty that it will be a success. This enterprise is one in which every citizen in the state should lend all of their aid and assistance, for its benefits to Nebraska will be of untold greatness. The state legislature should now do the handsome thing at its approaching session by appropriating a sufficient sum to enable the state to take a front rank in the manner of display. Among the officers at the heads of departments is Editor Rosewater of The Bee, as manager of the department of publicity, which fact is a guaranty that the public will at all times be fully cognizant of all that is happening during the preparatory work. Stand up for Nebraska by working for the Omaha exposition.</p>

    <p>Central City Nonpareil: The Nonpareil is a thorough believer in the benefits of advertising. It advocates it on the part of local merchants, and when it comes to the broader scale of the state we adhere to the same policy. When the enterprising men of our western states conclude that a transmississippi exposition would be a good thing for the industrial interests of the west, the Nonpareil thinks they have done about the proper thing and stands ready to put its shoulder to the wheel. The fact is, Nebraska needs a good advertisement. Stories

    <div3>
<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>    
<p>Lincoln, Neb., Jan. 19.&#8212;There was an expression of the interest in the Trans-Mississippi exposition bill evidenced tonight by the crowds which filled the floor, lobby and galleries of representative hall to hear the discussion before the house committee on finance, ways and means.</p>
<p>This meeting had been arranged for several days ago by the committee. There is a rule of both house of the legislature which requires that the proposer of a bill shall be given an opportunity to appear before the committee to which it is referred and present his arguments in its favor.</p>
<p>On account of the public interest in the exposition appropriation bill the committee on finance, ways and mean, to whom it had been referred, concluded that it would be nothing more than proper to invite all the members of the house and senate to hear the discussion. President G. W. Wattles of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition company and G. M. Hitchcock, head of the bureau of promotion, and author of the appropriation bill, had been invited to present the arguments in favor of the measure. To accommodate all who were invited the committee had asked for and been granted the use of representative hall for the meeting. Representative Charles Wooster of Merrick applied for permission to present the side of the opponents of the bill and Chairman Clark of the ways and means committee made the division so as to permit both sides being heard.</p>
    </div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">LARGE HALL FILLED.</head>
<p>At 8 o'clock tonight representative hall was filled with members of both houses, hardly a representative or senator being absent. The lobbies and galleries were filled with spectators, many ladies being in the crowd. Promptly at the hour for opening, Chairman Ralph Clark ascended to the speaker's desk and called the meeting to order. The speakers of the evening were seated in the space between the speaker's stand and the clerk's desk. Chairman Clark announced that the arrangement of the order of the evening was for President Wattles to open briefly, G. M. Hitchcock to follow, then Representative Wooster would answer and Mr. Hitchcock would reply. This was the order in which the speeches came. The brunt of the battle for and against the exposition was borne by the two last named speakers, President Wattles merely outlining the history of the inception and growth of the exposition idea.</p>
<p>The interest already felt in the bill was vastly increased by public discussion and both sides had a full presentation. Wooster made several telling points and brought out applause. It was no one-sided audience, but one which was ready to pay a tribute to a deftly turned point or rounded period.</p>    
<p>Mr. Hitchcock's appeal to the patriotism of Nebraskans and his declaration of confidence that permanent prosperity could only come from the restoration of bimetallism brought rounds of applause that showed that the sentiments were shared by the hearers. Chairman Clark introduced President Wattles and the latter said:</p>
    </div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WATTLES' ADDRESS.</head>
<p>"I deem it an honor to appear before you tonight to explain in a businesslike manner the project in which the people of the states of the Trans-Mississippi region are interested."</p>
<p>Briefly he described the manner in which the Trans-Mississippi congress was made up, and the place where it had held its eighth annual session. He then gave the history of the discussion of the conditions of business at the congress held at Omaha. Among the many things to which this congress devoted some time and discussion was a Trans-Mississippi exposition.</p>
<p>When the resolution proposing the Trans-Mississippi exposition was introduced, the speaker said there was a speech made in favor of locating it in Omaha by a man more eloquent than he, and, as it was appropriate, President Wattles read from the speech of W. J. Bryan before the Trans-Mississippi congress favoring the exposition at Omaha. The subsequent action of that congress in voting to favor the location at Omaha, the ratification of that act by the citizens of Omaha, the action of congress in passing the Allen bill and the subscription of $425,000 by the citizens of Omaha to comply with the conditions of the congressional appropriation of $200,000, were recited.</p>
<p>This action of congress had made the Trans-Mississippi exposition a national affair. It was never an Omaha affair. The Trans-Mississippi congress had selected that city, and the city had undertaken the burden. Several states had bills pending by which appropriation are promised. Congress is being asked to make the national appropriation $500,000. The speaker said he did not come before the legislature as the representative of beggars, but as equal partners in the industrial movement.</p>
    </div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">NO MONEY MAKING SCHEME.</head>
<p>President Wattles was succeeded by G. M. Hitchcock, head of the bureau of promotion. The speaker was received with applause. He did not come as the representative of any city or any corporation or any person. The subscriptions by the people of Omaha were put in without the expectation of any return being received therefor. What had been subscribed had been put in knowing it would never return a cent. There was no money to pay to secure legislation. The money raised had been raised to hold an exposition. The representatives of the Trans-Mississippi exposition came not to ask favors. They had done their part and came to ask the legislature to do its part for the honor and credit of the state. If the legislature does not do its part the Trans-Mississippi exposition is dead.</p>
<p>Because the business of the state is stagnated, the state treasury strained to its utmost limits, is no reason why such an appropriation should not be made, but is a reason why it should be made. It will inaugurate a feeling that will result in higher values and increase the volume of revenue to the state. Business is stagnant because immigration has been turned away from the state. Make immigration return and prosperity will return.</p>
<p>The amount asked for had been cut down to the limit which it was considered safe. A small appropriation would be wrong. To make the exposition what it should be, it should be a great one. Ex-Governor Frunas had recommended that the bill ask for $500,000. It had been cut by the speaker to the smallest limit. The great expositions which have been held and attracted visitors were mentioned. He appealed to his hearers to make Nebraska the Mecca for the tourists of the world for one year.</p>
    </div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">SENTIMENT WELL RECEIVED.</head>
<p>As a bimetallist he believed that permanent prosperity could only come when bimetallism is re-established.</p>
<p>This sentiment elicited applause. The speaker referred to the newspaper men's axiom that when business is dull you must advertise, and appealed to Representative Wooster as a newspaper man to know if he did not <choice><sic>indorse</sic><corr>endorse</corr></choice> that.</p>
<p>The speaker then took up some of the points in the bill which had called out criticism. These matters were for the careful consideration of the members. What Nebraska did would vitally affect the action of other states. I have nothing further to say until my friend, Mr. Wooster, has given more occasion for further speech.</p>
<p>The chairman introduced Mr. Wooster as one who had been selected to present the opposition. Mr. Wooster was received with a round of applause. He said that this was a hearing in reality before a joint session of the two houses and the gentlemen were here to influence the two houses. He was not here by choice, he was invited to come and had been selected by those opposed to the Omaha Trans-Mississippi exposition.</p>
    </div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">NO BENEFIT TO FARMERS.</head>
<p> He described the Trans-Mississippi congress, in which the idea originated, as like similar congresses which he had attended, as composed of a job lot of politicians. He wanted to know if the Trans-Mississippi exposition was not an Omaha project for the benefit of Omaha why was it that out of fifty directors not one was from outside of the city, why was it that only one laboring man was on the list. The gentlemen who had spoken were here as the representatives of the capitalists of Omaha.</p>
<p>The speaker was here as the representative of the farmer. The exposition would not benefit the farmer, it would be a detriment to the whole state outside of Omaha. He cited the case of the Columbian exposition, which drained money out of this and other states and the money had stayed in Chicago, where the visitors left it. He thought his constituents had sent him here, not to make some capitalist buy his farm, but to pass such laws as would permit the farmers of the state to keep their farms. He declared that the legislature should not give one cent to the Trans-Mississippi exposition. This brought out applause and laughter from the galleries. The state is as a state, he declared, bankrupt; there are some $2,000,000 of delinquent taxes which are not paid, not because the people are dishonest, but because they could not raise the money.</p>
    </div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">EIGHT-CENT CORN.</head>
<p>"Talk about taking money out of the state treasury," said he, "why, they have been trying to get money into the treasury for some time, and with very poor success. You had as well talk about getting blood out of a turnip. Shall we put additional burdens on these people?"</p>
<p>There were cries of "no, no."</p>
<p>It is simply outrageous and an imposition on the people to ask that such an appropriation should be asked. If submitted to a vote of the people, a proposition to vote the sum of $100,000 would be voted down, unless the corn crop could be sold for more than 8 cents. The corn crops have been worthless for money raising purposes for several years, and we are asked to advertise ourselves. Are we not advertised sufficiently already? The best advertisement would be to try to get into shape to pay our debts, and we will be given credit for our good intentions. As we value our state's good name, our state pride, let not this thing be done. If, as the gentlemen have said, the failure to this bill will result in the Trans-Mississippi exposition not being held, then I say let it not be held."</p>
<p>He said that he was ready to act quickly, as requested, and as quickly as he could he would vote for no appropriation. An appropriation should only be made after all institutions had been provided for. Before that was done the legislature would find that it had exceeded its power to appropriate. If the remarks had not given Mr. Hitchcock something to answer, the speaker hoped Mr. Hitchcock would keep his seat.</p>
    </div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">MR. HITCHCOCK'S REPLY.</head>
<p>Mr. Hitchcock, in beginning his reply, said that the gentleman from Merrick was not all noise, but he was glad to have heard so able an exposition of the arguments of the opposition to this bill. All the statements of the stagnant condition of business and state finances were but in truth so many strong arguments for renewed effort to bring back prosperity. The success of Nebraska, her growth, depends on the growth of the states west of us. He did not believe that the people of the state are opposed to the exposition. Three hundred and fifty country papers have declared their advocacy of the exposition. The speaker appealed to Wooster to know if he did not believe these men reflected the sentiments and interests of their people.</p>
<p>Wooster said: "The gentleman would not like for me to express my opinion of newspaper men."</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchcock got <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>
applause by his tribute to the country editor in his earnest, honest endeavors to benefit the people on whom he depended for a living. The speaker referred to the community of interest of all parts of the state in the exposition which caused him to go into a room every day and meet in a business way a man he would not speak to on the street. The bill is not an Omaha bill. It is a Nebraska bill. Omaha is a part of Nebraska. The state and the city are parts of the same body. Wealth in both are necessary. The speaker did not desire to lay additional burdens upon the people of the state. As a native born Nebraskan, he was in favor of bringing in more people to help bear the burdens. He referred to Wooster's comparison with the Chicago exposition, where the people took the money to Chicago and left it there, and said he thought it would be the proper thing to have the people bring all the money they wanted to Nebraska and leave it.</p>
<p>He did not believe, as a true Nebraskan, that any efforts should be spared to bring back to the people the small share of prosperity that will be possible under present conditions. There would be no general prosperity until in 1900 the new era was ushered in under new conditions.</p>
<p>After the close of Mr. Hitchcock's reply Chairman Clark announced that, according to the arrangement, that those who favored the bill should have the closing. The meeting would not stand adjourned.</p></div3>

                        <head type="sub">Inspecting Competing Sites for the Exposition is Lively Work.</head>
                        <p>The Chicago experts, Messrs. Alexander and Schrader, who are here inspecting the sites offered for the exposition, are having no idle moments. They are continually, when not asleep, in the presence of one or more of the promoters of the sites, and the rivalry among the latter, while good natured, is lively.</p>
                        <p>It was 3 o'clock Monday afternoon, instead of 1 o'clock, when they returned from Miller park, which fact kept City Attorney Connell waiting for two hours to take them to the Hanscom park site. They did the second trip up nicely in an hour and a half.</p>
                        <p>You won't have to be driven all over the country and run the danger of being lost in some of Parker's cornfields to see the place we have to show you," said Mr. Connell, laughingly.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday forenoon they were taken to Riverview by Judge Estelle, Dr. Hanchett and John Rush, and in the afternoon expected to look over the state fair grounds.</p></div2>

                        <ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
                        <p>Lincoln, Neb., Jan. 19.&#8212;The Nebraska State Agricultural association met this afternoon and listened to the report of the officers and adjourned until tomorrow. Secretary Furnas submitted his account of receipts and expenditures in an itemized form. From this it is learned that the receipts fell short of the expenditures to the amount of $2,015.88. Warrants were issued for this amount and the money with which to pay the warrants was borrowed by the board of managers.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Furnas takes occasion to make the following suggestion relative to the Trans-Mississippi exposition. He said: "As the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition, to be held in 1898, is now on a basis warranting success, it is here suggested that it would be proper and advisable that this board take steps looking to representation at that exposition. As it is to be held at Omaha, the metropolis of our own state, there will not again be afforded such a favorable opportunity for Nebraska to advantageously present her products, resources and possibilities to the eye of the world."</p></div2>
                    
                    <div2 type="article"><head type="sub">THAT EXPOSITION RAISE.</head>    
                        <p>Senators Allen and Thurston said today that they could with ease get the additional appropriation of $25,000 for the exposition through the senate as soon as the committee reports, but they both fear for its safety in the house. They think, however, that the addition, if passed by the senate to the house, would have a slight chance, which, if carefully watched, would be all that is necessary. Both claim that if they depend on the bill being passed through the house first, and then going to the senate, the exposition would get left, as far as the additional $25,000 is concerned.</p>
                        <p>The senators say that it would be impossible to get the house measure up in the house, but that Senator Allen's senate measure would receive recognition in the house without much effort being taken, therefore Allen and Thurston are keeping their eyes open, and expect things to come their way. The senate committee is liable to make the report inside of two days. There is no doubt whatever in the minds of those who know but that Representative Bailey of Texas will fight it vigorously. Mercer will either have to mesmerize him or else have him decoyed off the floor of the house, as it is said was done when the exposition bill went through the house last session. Mercer isn't saying a word.</p></div2></div1>

        <p>Central City Nonpareil: The Nonpareil is a thorough believer in the benefits of advertising. It advocates it on the part of local merchants, and when it comes to the broader scale of the state we adhere to the same policy. When the enterprising men of our western states conclude that a transmississippi exposition would be a good thing for the industrial interests of the west, the Nonpareil thinks they have done about the proper thing and stands ready to put its shoulder to the wheel. The fact is, Nebraska needs a good advertisement. Stories

<head type="sub">PUSHING THE EXPOSITION ALONG.</head>
<head type="sub">Liberal Appropriation in Its Aid Recommended to the Legislature.</head>
<p>During the summer and autumn of 1898, Nebraska will be visited by thousands and hundreds of thousands of citizens of other states. The Transmississippi Exposition will be held from June until November at Omaha and will undoubtedly attract people in great numbers from every section of the country. Various national organizations are arranging to hold their annual sessions at the Nebraska metropolis in 1898, so as to avail themselves of an opportunity of visiting the exposition while attending their meetings. I feel safe in predicting that the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha will be the greatest exposition of the products of the great west ever held.</p>
<p>This project had its origin more than a year ago at the Omaha session of the Transmississippi congress. Prominent men of that city promptly formed an association, with a capital stock of $1,000,000, of which more than $400,000 has been subscribed. The first assessment upon this stock has been paid and the affairs of the association are in good financial condition. The organizers and promoters are men of business ability, integrity and good financial standing; the organization is strong and the capital adequate. Congress recognized the importance of the exposition by an appropriation of $200,000, which, it is expected, will be increased to $500,000. The legislature of our sister state of Iowa has made a preliminary appropriation of $10,000, and the Iowa friends of the enterprise predict an additional appropriation of $65,000 at the next session. The legislatures of Utah and Louisiana have passed resolutions pledging the support of their states to the exposition, and liberal appropriations are expected from all the states and territories in the transmississippi country.</p>
<p>This exposition will unquestionably accomplish great good in bringing together the varied interests of the west and serve to cement the already friendly relations existing between the western  people. It will do for the west what the Atlanta exposition has done for the south, but in a  larger degree. Naturally Nebraska will profit largely by having this great exposition held on her soil. Interested visitors will learn of the great opportunities our state offers for investment and immigration.</p>
<p>You will be called upon by the management of the Transmississippi association to make an appropriation to aid the enterprise and I trust that the financial assistance given by you will be liberal and sufficient, so that our sister states and territories west of the Mississippi may be thereby encouraged to lend their substantial aid.</p></div2>
    
<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">FOR THE TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL.</head>    
<head type="sub">Exposition Committee Asked to Name Three Delegates.</head>
<p>Mayor Broatch has requested the executive committee of the Transmississippi and International Exposition to designate three suitable persons for appointment as commissioners from Omaha to the Tennessee Centennial, to be held at Nashville. There is no pay attached to these positions, but they are regarded as very desirable and honorable. It is requested that these persons who have the time and the inclination to visit Nashville as such commissioners make that fact known to members of the committee, and the request of the mayor will be complied with at the meeting of the committee tomorrow afternoon.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">LOCATION BIDS REFERRED</head>
<head type="sub">Special Committee Appointed to Examine Sites Suggested.</head>
<head type="sub">NEW ASSESSMENT ON EXPOSITION STOCK</head>
<head type="sub">Exposition Directory Wrestles with the Location Problem&#8212;Paxton Block Selected for Official Headquarters.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The board of directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition met in special session at 2 p.m. yesterday at the Commercial club rooms for the purpose of opening bids for the location of the exposition.</p>    
<p>There were forty-four of the fifty directors present and the first matter taken up was the opening of the bids in the hands of the secretary. There were five of these as follows: Riverview park, Miller park, the poor farm site, East Omaha and Elmwood park site.</p>
<p>Previous to the reading of the bids a resolution was offered by John C. Wharton, providing for the appointment of C. E. Yost, J. H. Millard and R. S. Wilcox as a committee of three, to which all bids for sites should be referred, the committee to be empowered to employ a competent engineer and a competent architect to carefully examine the proposed sites and report in writing to the committee their findings and conclusions, the committee to report such findings to the full board of directors at a meeting to be held January 23, without any recommendation on the part of the committee as to its conclusions regarding the desirability of any of the sites.</p>
<p>General Manderson suggested that the word "non-resident" be inserted before the words architect and engineer and urged the necessity for securing experts who would have no interest in the matter.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">BIDS IN DETAIL READ.</head>
<p>In response to a strong sentiment the secretary proceeded to read the bids in detail. All except the East Omaha proposition were very lengthy and contained extended arguments in support of the propositions submitted. The advocates of each site were represented in a numerous lobby and the reading of the verbose propositions was listened to with close interest.</p>
<p>The propositions, in brief, were as follows:</p>
<p>The East Omaha proposition was submitted by John A. Creighton and offered about 170 acres lying north of Cut-Off lake, the only provision being that the ground should be left in the same condition when vacated as when taken possession of by the Exposition association.</p>
<p>The Elmwood park proposition was submitted for the Omaha Fair and Speed association by Oscar J. Pickard, G W. Kelly, A. Clemens, W. L. Kelby, Daniel L. Johnson and A. T. Klopp. The proposed sited included a tender of 240 acres adjoining Miller park, which contains an additional eighty acres, and near to Fort Omaha, which contains nearly eighty acres.</p>
<p>The Riverview park proposition was submitted by the South Side Improvement club and was signed by John Powers, president, and F. K. Darling, secretary. It comprised 240 acres of land adjoining Riverview park, which were offered free of rental. To the proposition were attached agreements by John Green, N. J. Smith. J. H. Dumont, John Rush and Frank and George Sautter, owners of the land offered, agreeing to its use free of all charge.</p>
<p>The "poor farm site" was submitted by W. J. Connell "on behalf of himself and other property owners." It offered the "absolute, exclusive and unrestricted use of the land west and northwest of Hanscom park, bounded on the south by Center street, on the north by Pacific street and extending westward from Thirty-third street to a suitable and satisfactory point west of the Belt Line railway, including, as may be desired, from 125 to 160 acres." This was offered free of all expense except such slight expense as might <choice><sic>by</sic><corr>be</corr></choice> entailed by the removal of a few cheap houses now located on the land.</p>
<p>The resolutions adopted by the Board of County Commissioners and the Park board were read for the information of the directors.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">DEBATING THEIR DISPOSAL.</head>
<p>Mr. Wharton accepted the suggestion of General Manderson regarding changing the resolution offered by him to provide for employing a non-resident engineer and an architect and moved the adoption of the resolution.</p>
<p>Mr. Lindsey wanted the resolution amended to provide for having a representative of each proposed site on the committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosewater suggested that a landscape architect be employed instead of a building architect. Mr. Wharton changed the resolution to comply with this suggestion.</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchcock advocated increasing the committee by adding Mr. Kirkendall, the manager of the department of buildings and grounds, Mr. Lindsey, chairman of the executive committee, and President Wattles, for the reason that these gentlemen have given the matter of a site close consideration, and would be qualified to pass on such questions.</p>
<p>Governor Saunders opposed this suggestion, and advocated leaving the selection of the site almost entirely to experts who have no personal interest in the matter and could not be charged with bias or prejudice.</p>
<p>Mr. Wharton opposed any increase in the number of the committee, and made a strong talk in support of his position.</p>
<p>Mr. Kountze opposed throwing any responsibility for the selection of a site upon men who had any personal interest at stake.</p>
<p>Mr. Lindsey withdrew his amendment and a vote was taken upon the amendment of Mr. Hitchcock, providing that the committee should consist of six members, by adding Messrs. Kirkendall, Lindsey and Wattles. The roll was called and the amendment was lost, the vote standing: Yeas, 15; nays, 27.</p>
<p>The resolution was then adopted as originally introduced, except that it provides for a nonresident engineer and a nonresident landscape architect.</p>
<p>President Wattles reported that the committee appointed to report a plan for the enlargement of the plan and scope of the exposition, by the enlargement of the directory, had not completed its work, and asked further time, which was granted.</p>
<p>The executive committee reported regarding permanent headquarters that it had been unable to decide between two locations, the Paxton block and the Ramge block. The rental in each was the same, and the committee had no preference.</p>
<p>On motion of J. C. Wharton the Paxton block was selected for permanent headquarters.</p>
<p>On motion of C. S. Montgomery, a committee of three lawyers was provided for to examine into the question of the power of the city of Omaha, county of Douglas, and state of Nebraska, to make appropriations in aid of the exposition. The chair appointed Messrs. Montgomery, Manderson and Webster.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">ANOTHER ASSESSMENT LEVIED.</head>
<p>Chairman Lindsey, for the executive committee, recommended an assessment of 15 per cent on the stock of the association, this assessment to be payable in three equal installments, and due February 1, March 1 and April 1, respectively. The recommendation of the committee met with favor, and the assessment was ordered.</p>
<p>At the request of General Manderson the secretary stated that $18,143 had been collected on the first assessment, and of this amount $4,216 had been expended, leaving a balance on hand of $13,927.</p>
<p>F. M.  Youngs, the labor representative on the board, introduced the following resolution:</p>
<p>Resolved, That all contracts entered into by this board, its officers or agents, for work pertaining to the Transmississippi and International Exposition must stipulate therein that resident labor of Douglas county&#8212;skilled or unskilled&#8212;shall be given preference over all others, and that unskilled labor shall be paid no less than $1.50 per day; provided, that the said stipulation shall not apply to works prosecuted by other states or outside interests.</p>
<p>In support of this resolution Mr. Youngs made a brief speech, urging its adoption.</p>
<p>Mr. Lindsey said the exposition is not to be an Omaha show, and there should be no attempt made to bottle it up by restricting it in such a way.</p>
<p>General Manderson said he did not doubt that the exposition would be conducted, as far as possible, along the lines indicated in the resolution, but he was opposed to giving notice to the world to that effect. He moved to refer the resolution to the executive committee for consideration, and for such action as it thought best.</p>
<p>Director Wells of Council Bluffs said he had worked for the support of the exposition, and his principal argument had been that the laboring interests of the city over the river would be given recognition. He said if this resolution should pass he would be helpless. He also stated that he had intended to go to the state legislature to work for an appropriation for an Iowa exhibit, and had intended to lay particular stress upon the fact that the Exposition was to be a transmississippi affair, but he said if this resolution was adopted his hands would be tied and he would feel like dropping the matter.</p>
<p>Governor Saunders spoke very earnestly on the resolution. He warned the supporters of it that its adoption would be fatal to the success of the exposition. He predicted that such action would make the exposition an Omaha affair, and would take away the breadth of character which it was designed to have. He urged the introducer to withdraw the resolution.</p>
<p>Mr. Youngs said he was on the board as a representative of labor interests and was not acting on his own motion, entirely. He refused to withdraw the resolution or make any change in it. He said it did not in any way affect the work to be done by other

<pb n="24" xml:id="TMISB02-024"/>

states or outside interests. He thought the effect of the resolution on the Nebraska legislature would be good rather than the reverse.</p>
<p>The motion to refer the resolution to the executive committee was then adopted, Youngs being the only one to vote against the reference.</p>
<p>The board then adjourned to meet in two weeks to receive the report of the special committee on sites.</p></div3></div2>
    <div2 type="article">
<head type="sub">Short Session of Executive Board.</head>
<p>The executive committee of the exposition held a session both before and after the meeting of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Acting upon the request of the mayor, the committee recommended the appointment of G. R. Williams, G. G. Wallace and T. S. Clarkson as commissioners for Omaha to the Tennessee Centennial exposition at Nashville.</p>
<p>A communication from C. S. Montgomery was read, in which he agreed to give his services free of charge as advisory counsel to the executive committee.</p>
<p>The rules and regulations governing exhibitors and concessionaires were reported back from the special committee, and were approved and ordered printed.</p>
<p>The committee adjourned until tomorrow noon.</p></div2>

<p>Both the executive committee and the directory of the Trans-Mississippi exposition held important meetings yesterday afternoon, permanent offices and headquarters for the exposition being selected, propositions for sites being selected, propositions for sites being opened and refereed, counsel engaged, the labor question discussed, future assessments on stock decided on and other matters of importance settled.</p>    
<p>G. R. Williams, George G. Wallace and T. S. Clarkson were recommended by the executive committee to Mayor Broatch for appointment as commissioners from the city of Omaha to the Tennessee Centennial exposition at Nashville. The recommendation was requested by the mayor and the men named will be appointed.</p>    
<p>C.S. Montgomery was selected as general counsel for the exposition, his offer, in reply to a letter regarding the matter, to serve without compensation except in case of litigation being accepted.</p>    
<p>Managers Rosewater and Hitchcock of the departments of publicity and promotion submitted reports of work done since the last meeting, which were approved and arrangements were made to push the work of the departments. Reports and recommendations to the board of directors were discussed and adopted.</p>
    </div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">DIRECTORS' MEETING.</head>    
<p>The directory met at 2:30 o'clock, forty-two of the fifty members being present. A large number of citizens, propers and friends of the different sites, were also present.</p>    
<p>Under the special order for the meeting the opening of offers of sites for the exposition was ordered.</p>
<p>Mr. Wharton offered a resolution that all bids be referred to a committee composed of Casper E. Yost, J. H. Millard and R. S. Wilcox, the committee to employ a competent engineer and architect to report on sites, the committee to report back, without recommendations of its own, to a general meeting of the directory, to be held January 23 at 2 o'clock p.m., such meeting to decide on a site.</p>    
<p>General Manderson moved that "nonresident" be placed before the words, engineer and architect. Amendment accepted.</p>
<p>The resolution was ruled out on a point of order, and the reading in full of the propositions were ordered. They were for Miller park, Riverview park, Elmwood park, East Omaha and Hanscom park sites. The substance of each bid is given below. Letters from the park commissioners offering the use of any park selected, and from the county commissioners offering the use of the poor farm lots, were read. The substance of each bid is given below.</p>
<p>Mr. Wharton again offered his resolution. Mr. Lindsey moved that each of the proposed sites be given a representative on the committee, but later withdrew the motion. Mr. Hitchcock moved that Manager Kirkendall of the buildings and grounds department, Manager Lindsey of the ways and means department, and President Wattles be added to the committee, and spoke in favor of the motion. After discussion by Messrs. Montgomery, Saunders, Wharton, Kountze and others the amendment was lost by a vote of twenty-seven to fifteen, and Mr. Wharton's original resolution, with amendments that the engineer and architect be from outside the city, and that it be a landscape architect, was then unanimously adopted.</p>
    </div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">PERMANENT OFFICES SELECTED.</head>    
<p>Chairman Lindsey reported that of the bids for permanent offices those for the Paxton and Ramge blocks were the best, that they were about equal so far as both accommodations and expenditures were concerned. After further explanation and discussion the offices in the Paxton block were unanimously selected.</p>    
<p>C. S. Montgomery reported having examined into the question of the appropriations by the city, county and state for the exposition. So far as the city and county were concerned they were serious and important questions involved, and he suggested that a committee of three lawyers, members of the directory, be appointed to make a further investigation and report. The president appointed Messrs. Montgomery, Manderson and Webster.</p>

        <head type="sub">FIVE PER CENT ASSESSMENTS.</head>
<p>Chairman Lindsey of the executive committee reported it had been decided to recommend that three 5 per cent assessments be made on stock subscriptions, payable February 1, March 1 and April 1. Secretary Wakefield reported that of the first 5 per cent assessment $18,143 had been received and that there was a balance in the treasury January 1 of $13,927. The expenses from this time forward, and especially after the site was selected and work actually commenced, would increase rapidly. The $1,800 of the first assessment still unpaid was principally from subscribers of one or two shares, who could not afford to lose the time from work to call and pay the 50 cents or $1 due from them. When a collector was employed they would pay up promptly. R. S. Wilcox suggested that the assessments be 10, 5, and 10 per cent, but others favored the three 5 per cent assessments, and the recommendation of the executive committee was adopted.</p></div3>
<div3>    
<head type="sub">LABOR RESOLUTIONS.</head>    
<p>F. M. Young, representing the labor organizations on the directory, offered the following resolution:</p>    
<p>Resolved, That all contracts entered into by this board, its officers or agents, for work pertaining to the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition must stipulate therein that resident labor of Douglas county, skilled and unskilled, shall be given preference to all others, and that skilled labor shall be paid not less than $1.50 per day; provided that the said stipulation shall not apply to work prosecuted by other states or outside interests.</p>    
<p>Mr. Young spoke of the trouble caused at the Atlanta exposition by bringing in outside labor and by cheap labor, and said that while their subscriptions might not amount to so much in dollars, that over two-thirds of the 6,000 subscribers to exposition stock were from the ranks of labor, and advocated the employment and protection of home labor.</p>
</div3>
<div3>    
<head type="sub">NOT AN OMAHA SHOW.</head>    
<p>Mr. Lindsey said he was opposed to the resolution, and to any one like it. The exposition was not an Omaha show, but a Trans-Mississippi affair, in which all the western country was equally interested, and the adoption of resolutions like the one offered would be simply bottling up the exposition.</p>    
<p>General Manderson doubted the advisability of passing such a resolution; it would tend to localize the exposition, when the whole effort of the directory should be to broaden it in every way. Without any such resolution being offered or adopted, the directory would, without doubt, do what was desired, that is, employ home labor as far as possible. Therefore, he moved the reference of the resolution to the executive committee.</p>    
<p>Mr. Young declared that no argument for referring or defeating the resolution had been offered. It was not the intention of the resolution to apply to the appropriations of other states or of any outside appropriations; the resolution stated so plainly, and was simply offered for the purpose of having the board go on record as in favor of the protection of home labor and industry. He asked that it be adopted.</p>    
<p>Mr. Wells of Council Bluffs said that he was the only member of the directory from outside Omaha; it was his intention to go before the Iowa legislature when it convened to ask for an additional appropriation, but if such a resolution, shutting out Iowa and the rest of the world, was adopted, he could not do it. If Mr. Young would reconsider the matter he would not want the directory to adopt such a resolution.</p></div3>
<div3>    
<head type="sub">WOULD AFFECT LEGISLATION.</head>    
<p>Ex-Governor Saunders said he saw something in the resolution decidedly worse than the little squabble which might come up over the selection of a site for the exposition. Strangers were already coming into the city inquiring about the exposition; if a stranger came into his office and asked about coming to Omaha, and if he could get work if he did so, and he should reply "No, sir," that only residents could be employed on exposition work, he, and others like him seeking a residence in Omaha, would stay away. The adoption of such a resolution would certainly have a bad effect on the legislatures of other states, which are being asked for appropriations, and it would be used as an argument against an appropriation by Nebraska if it was adopted. He advised and asked that it be withdrawn.</p>    
<p>Mr. Young said that he was not acting for himself individually but for those he represented, the laboring element, in offering the resolution and he declined to withdraw it. He again stated that it only referred to Douglas county, and argued that money contributed by residents of Douglas county should go to the support of residents of it.</p>    
<p>The motion to refer to the executive committee was then carried and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<div3>    
<head type="sub">MILLER PARK AND FORT OMAHA.</head>    
<p>Dave H. Christie, secretary of the North End Improvement association, submitted a proposition for 400 acres, including Miller park, the 160 acres directly north of Miller park, the eighty acres extending south from the west half of Miller park, along Fort Omaha reserve, and the Fort Omaha reserve. More land on the north, south or west can be had, if desired. The Fort Omaha part of the site has not yet been obtained, but it is stated that the use of it can be had from the government without difficult.</p>    
<p>The first point made is that the site is level and sightly; that it would cost very little to grade and put it in condition for the exposition. If permanent buildings are erected they will remain for the use of the city. It is accessible being reached from the city without grades by four or more street car lines out Twentieth, Twenty-Fourth, Thirtieth and other streets, and by the East Omaha bridge by all railroads from the east; the Florence boulevard, the handsomest in the city, passes and enters it. A thirty-six-inch water main, affording ample fire protection and water, already laid along one side of it. Visitors would pass through the city going to and from it. If located there F. W. Parker would donate his museum of curious, valued at $25,000, to the city, to be placed in one of the permanent buildings.</p>
</div3>
<div3>    
<head type="sub">"POOR FARM" SITE.</head>    
<p>W.J. Connell, for himself and other owners of the property, offered the lots and lands adjoining Griffen &amp; Smith's addition, Oakhurst, and poor farm lots, west and northwest of Hanscom park, bounded by Center on the south, Hanscom park on the east, Thirty-third street on the north, and containing 160 acres. More land, if desired, can be had on the west.</p>    
<p>Nearness to the city and elevation and beauty of the site are two of the principal points urged. The city would give use of streets and alleys in site, and several small houses on it could be removed at slight cost. All details could be satisfactorily arranged. Accessibility to street car lines and to railroad lines by the Belt line on the west, construction of a boulevard from Hanscom to Bemis park, water at the grounds, fire protection, and that visitors would always be near to the center of the city, are all dwelt upon.</p>
</div3>
<div3>    
<head type="sub">NORTH OF EAST OMAHA.</head>    
<p>John A. Creighton, for himself and other owners, offered 170 acres, with more if desired, between Cut-Off and Florence lakes. Accessibility to street car lines from all parts of the city without climbing any grades, and to all railroads entering the city, and beauty of site, including lakes, are urged in the proposition.</p>
</div3>
<div3>    
<head type="sub">NEW STATE FAIR GROUNDS.</head>    
<p>The Omaha Fair and Speed association and owners of property in vicinity offered Elmwood park, 205 acres, more or less, and the state fair grounds, 160 acres, with more land if desired. Beauty of Elmwood park and fair grounds
    
<pb n="25" xml:id="TMISB02-025"/>



and improvements made on the latter, including mile track, laying out of boulevards, driveways and walks, and buildings, are urged. The state board of agriculture would agree not to hold a fair exposition year. Water from artesian wells, the supply capable of being enlarged to any extent, accessibility to street car lines already constructed and others which would be constructed, and to roads now built to the grounds are also urged.</p>
</div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">RIVERVIEW PARK.</head>    
<p>The South Side Improvement club offered Riverview park and adjoining grounds which it has leased from Tom Murray and others, for two years, comprising over 200 acres and extending from Bancroft to Dominion street, and from Thirteenth street to the river. Nearness to the city, the river frontage, the sightliness of the location, accessibility to street and steam railways, and to boats, city water and sewerage, and artesian well flowing 115,000 gallons of water every twenty-four hours through a four-inch pipe, natural forest trees, refreshing breezes and coolness in summer are among the arguments used in favor of the site.</p>

    <head type="main">TALKS OF THE EXPOSITION</head>
<head type="sub">VIEWS EXPRESSED BY PRESIDENT WATTLES</head>
<head type="sub">Holdings of the Great Show in Omaha Will Do Much Toward Developing the Great Transmississippi Country.</head>
    <div3>
<p>Asked if he noticed any increase in enthusiasm in support of the Transmississippi and International Exposition among the business men throughout the country, President Gurdon W. Wattles said:</p>
<p>"I think the friends of the exposition are becoming more numerous and determined every day, and with each step forward some of those who opposed the enterprise from the start are falling into line. The sentiment seems to be growing that we must do something to start this city and transmississippi country up the grade again, and that the first and best thing to do is, if possible, to attract capital and immigration in this direction. At the first mention of this exp<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> a few men saw in it a great advert<unclear reason="torn"></unclear>g scheme for Omaha and the entire west. Many said it could not be made a success on account of the times; that congress would do nothing for it, and when the proposition was made to raise $250,000 by subscriptions to stock, it was difficult to get our leading business men to undertake such a task. But when congress did pass an act, authorizing the expenditure of $200,000, some of those who had not seriously considered the proposition before, became its active supporters. When the committees secured over $400,000 in subscriptions, with numerous large interests yet to hear from, which should swell the amount to at least $600,000, many more doubters came over with the hopeful. But there are some yet who, while in favor of the exposition, doubt our ability to hold it. This has been true of every exposition or other great public enterprise. At Chicago there were many who opposed the World's hear against the exposition. They said the city was too poor; the streets were not in proper condition; there were not a sufficient number of hotels, and there was not time to get ready. At San Francisco all these arguments were urged with double force, and yet they did make a great success at both those places. At San Francisco they opened their gates eight months after the Midwinter fair was first mentioned. It was originated and carried out during the greatest panic this country has ever seen. Over 2,000,000 people passed through its gates, and over $60,000 remained in the treasury after all obligations were discharged."</p>
    </div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">OF OTHER EXPOSITIONS.</head>
<p>Asked as to his opinion as to the results of the exposition on the transmississippi country, Mr. Wattles said:</p>
<p>I can only judge by what similar expositions have done for other sections. The World's fair did not particularly advertise any locality. It was a great educational success. In architecture, science, mechanics, electricity, and even music and religion, it marked a new epoch in history. To Chicago and the lines of transportation centering there the greatest financial benefits were derived. The city of Chicago gave $5,000,000 in bonds to the exposition. The assessed valuation of the city increased nearly $200,000,000 in one year, and the taxes on this increase alone for two years would pay all the bonds they gave. Besides this direct benefit to the city, it is estimated that $1,000,000 daily was expended in the city by visitors during the entire exposition.</p>
<p>"At Atlanta the exposition did much to start the tide of immigration and capital south, and the good effects of the advertising of the resources can be readily seen by the increased prosperity which prevails in the southern states at this time. Speaking of the immediate benefits of their exposition, the editor of the Atlanta Constitution says they got back $100 for every $1 expended.</p>
<p>"At San Francisco the effect of the exposition was especially beneficial to the state of California. Its climate, its fruit and wines and other resources were brought to the attention of the world, and the influx of capital and increase of population has been phenomenal since. They have known little of the hard times and depression we have felt during the past three years.</p>
<p>"The further growth of Omaha depends upon the development of the country west of us. We are the natural commercial metropolis for a great and undeveloped country, reaching westward to the coast. This great transmississippi country has untold wealth in agricultural lands, that need but the developing agencies of civilization to furnish happy homes for millions who now live in poverty in crowded cities. There are mountains of gold and silver, subterranean lakes of oil, great deposits of coal, iron and minerals of every kind, that have never been heard of by but few of the people of even our own country. It is to advertise these natural advantages that we propose to hold this exposition. Marvin Hughitt well understood the advantages and appreciated the results of this enterprise when he said a few days ago that it offered the best means of advertising the west of anything that had ever been proposed."</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">ROOMS FOR EXPOSITION OFFICERS.</head>
<head type="sub">Selected on Sixth Floor of Paxton Block.</head>
<p>The executive committee of the Transmississippi Exposition held a meeting this noon at the Commercial club and adjourned to visit the rooms on the sixth floor of the Paxton block, which will be the permanent headquarters of the exposition as soon as they can be placed in condition for occupancy. The committee selected the rooms at the southwest corner of the floor and will add additional rooms as the needs of the various departments require.</p>
<p>The exact arrangement of the several departments of the exposition will be decided later, but it was determined that the Department of Publicity should remain in its present location in The Bee building. In this connection Manager Rosewater stated the department required so much of his time that unless it was close to his office it would be impossible for him to give it his attention. The Department of Ways and Means will be installed in the new quarters as soon as possible. This will carry the secretary's office with it, and the headquarters will be removed from the Bee building to the Paxton block within a few days.</p>
<p>James Sheakley, governor of Alaska, was appointed vice president for that territory to represent the exposition.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">ALIVE TO THE EXPOSITION</head>
<head type="sub">EAST AND WEST BEGIN TO SHOW INTEREST</head>
<head type="sub">Plan to Exhibit a Fac-Simile of a Wonderful Gold Producing Valley&#8212;Eastern Papers Publishing Information.</head>
<p>That the enterprising people of the great west are fully alive to the bearing that the Transmississippi Exposition will have on their interests is indicated by the plans which are already in process of incubation for exhibiting the resources of the western states. A number of ideas are being worked out which promise to furnish the exposition with novel and attractive features, such as have not been seen at any of the great expositions in recent years. Some of the projects suggested are capable of being worked out in a manner which will give the big show attractions even more interesting to its visitors than those which amused hundreds of thousands of people at the World's fair. One of the most novel and promising of these enterprises comes from Utah, where the people are showing an enthusiastic interest in the exposition.</p>
<p>A movement is on foot in the Mercur mining district of Utah to exhibit a facsimile of the Mercur basin at the exposition. It is proposed that this facsimile shall be about one-fifteen-hundredth of the natural size of the district represented; that is, that the 1,500 or 2,000 acres included in what is known as the basin are to be in the facsimile reduced to the size of an acre.</p>
<p>The geology of the Mercur district is unlike that of any other mining district in the world. It is, however, simple and easily understood when once seen and studied. What is called the vein is simply a mineralized stratum of lime rock varying in thickness from eight to eighty feet. This vein is in its relation to the country rock identical with the coal measures throughout the world.</p>
<p>This vein or stratum has an angle of fifteen to thirty degrees. The mountains about the sag or crater are broken and sometimes <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>cipitous and are cut in every direction by deep gulches, and to the west are cleft by Lewiston canyon, exposing the gold-bearing stratum in numerous places and for long distances.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the exhibit shall be an exact facsimile, showing the mountains, canyons, gulches, strata, tunnels, ore dumps (with small representations of the great mills) just as they exist, only on a reduced scale. The beholder will be able to see Mercur basin and at a glance know more about it than could be obtained from any amount of reading.</p>
<p>Geologically, the Mercur basin is a place of great interest. The United States government survey devotes 200 pages to it, and a new survey has been ordered. Mercur is the youngest and the least advertised of the great mining camps of the world, and by 1808 it will be a matter of universal interest; and it is believed the exhibit will be one of the attractions of the exposition.</p>
<p>That the east is awakening to the fact that the exposition will be an affair of national interest is indicated by the prominence which it is receiving in the columns of eastern publications. Even the annual almanacs of the big New York papers devote considerable space to the history of the movement and to descriptions of what the enterprise is designed to be.</p>
<p>The recently published 1897 almanac of the New York Tribune gives a fairly complete synopsis of the plans for the exposition. It recites the fact that the $200,000 government appropriation is already supported by a subscription of $400,000 in Omaha, and liberal appropriations from the legislatures of the states most intimately interested. It calls attention to the fact that the census of 1890 shows a population of over 20,000,000 of <choice><sic>peole</sic><corr>people</corr></choice> within a radius of 500 miles of Omaha, with an aggregate wealth of $23,576,586,897. It tells something of the international scope on which the enterprise is designed, and gives the list of officers of the exposition association.</p>
<p>The almanac of the New York World covers substantially the same ground, in somewhat less space, and the Chicago News almanac gives a still more exhaustive review of the project. The news goes into the plan of organization of the exposition, and details the steps which have already been taken at some length. It speaks of the action of the legislatures of Iowa, Louisiana, California and other western states in pledging large exhibits, and gives the entire personnel of the officers and directory.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">WOMAN'S CLUB AND EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">Mrs. Ford Tells Why the Club House Should Be Built.</head>
<p>"'Why in the world do the members of the Woman's club talk about erecting a club house at this time, when the promotion of the Transmississippi Exposition is engaging the attention of all Omahans?' is a query that is often addressed to me," said Mrs. Frances M. Ford the other day. I presume that the people who ask such questions think it utterly impossible for two such enterprises to be conducted simultaneously.</p>
<p>"In my mind there could be no greater mistake than such argument. I believe that the woman's department will be one of the most essential and valuable institutions connected with the Exposition. The exhibit of material objects is, as I understand it, only one of the purposes of the exposition. As was the case at the Columbian exposition, there will undoubtedly be a congress of religion, of philosophy, of art, of pedagogy, and of matters of vital interest to women. The Woman's club of Omaha hopes to be of real assistance to the exposition in promoting the success of such a department. Specialists on these subjects are to be brought here from all over the world. It will be the duty of some organization to secure them, bring them here, entertain them and give them a place to hold the congresses desired.</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly these congresses, if we are to get the greatest amount of good out of them, must be held apart from the exposition. They should be held down town, I think, where the scholars may be apart from the crowd. This was found to be the best method at Chicago. An auditorium, not of great dimensions, but well arranged and with a number of committee rooms conveniently located, must be provided. This is the reason why I say that the erection of a club house by the Woman's club before the opening of the exposition is of the greatest importance. There the congresses and the meetings of the woman's clubs may be conveniently held, and in this way the Omaha Woman's club may be of assistance to the exposition. At the next meeting of our club a committee will be appointed to confer with the exposition directory upon this and kindred matters. You must remember that what I've said represents merely my own views upon the matter and does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the other members of the Woman's club."</p></div2>

<head type="sub">THE EXPOSITION BILL INTRODUCED.</head>
<p>Yesterday the bill providing for an appropriation of $350,000 by the state of Nebraska in aid of the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition was introduced. In another column we publish it in full.</p>
<p>It is now before the people and before the legislature, and it should be fully, fairly and promptly considered and acted on.</p>
<p>The occasion which calls for this bill is a remarkable one in Nebraska's history.</p>
<p>Nineteen states and three territories propose to hold a great exposition of their resources and products. The west is to make a mighty effort to attract the attention of the world and turn the tide of investors and homeseekers once more toward the setting sun. Nebraska has been selected by a vote of all her western sisters as the state wherein all shall exhibit their offerings and display their attractions. Omaha has been selected as the place.</p>
<p>Congress has recognized the enterprise, and a splendid United States government exhibit in a government building will be one of the features of the show.</p>
<p>Foreign countries will be invited to participate, and for that purpose the department of state is now taking action to direct our ambassadors and consuls in foreign lands to bring the exposition to the attention of exhibitors.</p>
<p>Private enterprise will provide $500,000 or $600,000, and it is quite possible that before the gates of the great exposition are thrown open as much as $2,000,000 will have been expended.</p>
<p>Such an enterprise is one which affords to the state in which it is located a rare opportunity. All Nebraska will be on exhibition, not only while the great fair is in progress, but while it is in preparation.</p>
<p>The World-Herald lays this matter before the legislature of Nebraska with a full realization of the objections, doubts and difficulties.</p>
<ab>Nebraska is hard up.</ab>
<ab>Taxes are high.</ab>
<ab>Times are hard.</ab>
<p>Relief from depression must come through the development of the west. The exposition is one thing which we can depend on to renew public interest in the west and revive activity in western enterprises.</p>
<p>A small exposition would be a failure. The enterprise must be big to be successful. We must go in with courage and public spirit. It will be economical to be liberal. The cost of the enterprise is not an expense, but an investment. We cast out bread upon the waters, believing that it will return to us again.</p>

<head type="sub">Suggestion by a Foreign Commissioner as to Advertising It.</head>
<p>President Wattles of the exposition association has a letter from Prof. J. H. Gore of Columbia university, one of the United States commissioners to the Brussels exposition, in reply to one informing him of the acceptances of his offer to also represent the Trans-Mississippi exposition at Brussels. He says that as soon as he has received the details of the exposition at Omaha he thinks it would be well to have printed a circular in French for distribution at Brussels. He also suggests a stamp to be used on the back of envelopes by business men, they paying something for the privilege. He sends specimens of stamps which have been designed for the same purpose and he says that later he will send the design of a poster which he thinks could be used to advantage.</p>
<p>Workmen are busy fitting up the rooms on the sixth floor of the Paxton block, which are to be used for headquarters. Secretary Wakefield says that the departments of exhibits and concessions will probably be able to move in today or Saturday. "They will not move in Friday," said he with a little laugh. His own rooms will not be ready until the middle of next week.</p>
<p>The department of promotion is now sending off to the several western state legislatures copies of bills in aid of the exposition, which it expects to be submitted.</p></div2>
    
<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">LABOR CIRCLES STIRRED UP.</head>
<head type="sub">Report of Director Youngs of the Exposition Received.</head>
<p>The meeting of the Central Labor union last evening was particularly exciting as a result of the report of Fred M. Youngs, the representative of organized labor on the board of directors of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition association.</p>
<p>The report was quite voluminous and contained the resolutions affecting the interests of labor which Youngs has vainly introduced at the meetings of the exposition board, and each of which has heretofore been published. In addition Youngs declared that organized labor must make the fight of its life to prevent the same conditions of life of the workingmen of Atlanta after the close of the southern exposition. This condition was described at length in a letter received by Youngs from Robert W. McGinly of the Atlanta Central Labor union, as being most disastrous to labor, the wages of common laborers being cut from $1.25 per day before the exposition to 60 cents per day after its close, and which is now the present wages. The report declares in substance that it is utterly impossible, from the present management of the exposition, for organized labor to obtain the slightest concession, and that it is more than probable that even Douglas county workmen, suffering as they are, will be set aside to give employment to outside, cheap labor.</p>
<p>The reading of the report brought a dozen men to their feet, and anathema followed anathema against the directors of the exposition, the anger of the delegates resulting in an adjournment until next Wednesday, when a plan will be discussed of calling a mass meeting of all Omaha workmen to protest against their exclusion from work on the exposition and to take steps to see that they do get work, or that the support of the workingmen of the entire Trans-Mississippi country be withdrawn from the exposition. This was the tone of the discussion as to the plans to be laid next Wednesday.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Exposition Committee Men Will Confer with World's Fair Officials.</head>
<p>The special committee appointed at the meeting of the directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition to consider the five proposals for the location of the exposition has been in consultation and two members have decided to go to Chicago for the purpose of selecting an engineer and architect to survey the proposed sites and make a comprehensive report as to the advantages and disadvantages of each. This committee is instructed to employ a non-resident engineer and a non-resident landscape architect to examine the sites and make a written report to the committee, which report the committee is instructed to submit to the full board without any recommendation or suggestion on the part of the committee.</p>
<p>The special committee has been in almost continuous session since its appointment, and was somewhat at a loss as to just how to proceed, and after consultation it was decided that the best and speediest results would be accomplished by going direct to Chicago and holding a consultation with the officers of the World's fair and gaining as much information as possible from them as to the best method of procedure. Acting on this decision, Messrs. Yost and Wilcox will go to Chicago tonight, if the storm does not prevent, and will at once take up matter in the most expeditious way. The committee is required to report to the Board of Directors on January 23.</p>    
<p>The work of selecting rooms in the Paxton block by the various departments is progressing slowly. President Wattles has selected his room, and will occupy it as soon as it can be made ready. The Department of Ways and Means will decide very soon upon the rooms to be occupied by it, and will remove to them as soon as possible. All of the rooms to be occupied at the present time are on the west side of the sixth floor, near the elevator.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Nebraska Will Be Asked to Appropriate the Sum of Three Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars for the Big Show.</head>
<head type="sub">The Share That the State Is Requested to Contribute Toward Making the International Exposition a Success.</head>
<head type="sub">Text of the Bill Introduced by Representative Dudley Smith of Douglas&#8212;-Twelve Directors on Part of State Provided With It.</head>
    
<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
<ab>Lincoln, Neb., Jan. 13.&#8212;This afternoon Representative Dudley Smith of Douglas county introduced the Trans-Mississippi exposition bill in the house.</ab>
<ab>The bill was read the first time, and tomorrow will be read a second time and referred, probably to the ways and means committee.</ab>
<ab>The bill is as follows:</ab>

<p>A BILL FOR AN ACT TO APPROPRIATE $350,000 TO AID IN THE HOLDING OF THE TRANS-MISSISSIPPI AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION AT THE CITY OF OMAHA, NEBRASKA, IN THE YEAR 1898, AND TO PROVIDE FOR THE APPOINTMENT BY THE GOVERNOR OF TWELVE DIRECTORS TO REPRESENT THE STATE OF NEBRASKA UPON THE DIRECTORY OF SAID EXPOSITION.</p>
<p>Whereas, There is to be held at the city of Omaha in the state of Nebraska, in the year 1898, an exposition known as the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, participated in by many western states, and,</p>
<p>Whereas, The said exposition had its origin in a resolution unanimously adopted at a former session of the Trans-Mississippi congress participated in by all the states west of the Mississippi river, and was designed to advertise and develop western interests, and,</p>
<p>Whereas, The Congress of the United States has passed a bill authorizing and encouraging the holding of said exposition, and making an appropriation to provide for an exhibit by the Untied States government at said exposition, in a building to be constructed by the federal government, and,</p>
<p>Whereas, A corporation with a proper capital has been duly organized under the laws of the state of Nebraska to carry on the business affairs of said exposition and is now proceeding with the work of preparation so that said exposition may be held from June to November in the year 1898, and,</p>
<p>Whereas, The location of said exposition at the city of Omaha in the state of Nebraska has afforded to this state an auspicious opportunity to exhibit its own resources and products in said exposition, and also as a state to secure great and lasting benefits as a result of the coming of all the visitors from other states, and</p>
<p>Whereas, Homeseekers and investors can by means of this exposition be attracted in large numbers to Nebraska, and</p>
<p>Whereas, Private enterprise alone cannot adequately provide the necessary capital for this great public undertaking by which the whole state is to be largely benefited, therefore</p>
<p>Be it enacted by the legislature of the state of Nebraska:</p>
<p>Section 1. That the state of Nebraska take part in said exposition as hereinafter provided.</p>
<p>Section 2. That the governor of the state of Nebraska be, and he is hereby authorized and directed, to appoint twelve state directors, two being from each congressional district of Nebraska, said state directors to be authorized and empowered to represent the state of Nebraska upon the board of directors of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.</p>
<p>Section 3. That the governor be, and is hereby authorized, to fill any vacancy occurring among said twelve state directors.</p>
<p>Section 4. That the governor be, and is hereby authorized, to notify the said Trans-Mississippi and International exposition of the appointments when made as above provided.</p>
<p>Section 5. That if the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition shall, within thirty days after the receipt of said notification, cause the said state directors so appointed by the governor to be duly and legally elected directors of said corporation with full power as such, and at such compensation as is provided in section 8 of this act, then the appropriation hereinafter provided for shall be and become available as below provided for the use of said exposition.</p>
<p>Section 6. That for the purpose of assisting said Trans-Mississippi and International exposition to properly plan, carry on, develop and complete the said exposition, the sum of $350,000 be and the same is hereby appropriated from the state treasury out of any funds not otherwise appropriated.</p>
<p>Section 7. That said sum of money shall be and become available for said exposition in five equal installments during the period between July 1, 1897, and July 1, 1898, and shall be paid out by the state treasurer upon warrants drawn to the order of the treasurer of said Trans-Mississippi and International exposition by the auditor of Nebraska, who is hereby authorized and directed to draw the same upon requisitions authorized by the recorded vote of a majority of the directors of said exposition, and upon certificates of the president showing that said vote has been had and recorded.</p>
<p>Section 8. That at the time said twelve state directors are elected by the stockholders of said exposition, and before the above appropriation shall become available, the board of directors shall, by the proper action, provide and order that during his term of office each of said state directors on the board shall receive $75.00 per month compensation from said exposition, together with railway transportation so as to enable him to attend all meetings of the board of directors, when taken, shall be duly certified to the state auditor and kept on file in his office.</p>
<p>Section 9. The term of office of the twelve directors herein provided for shall begin with their appointment and end one month after the close of the exposition, at which time they shall make to the governor a report. Said directors shall draw no other salary or compensation for their services than that above provided for to be paid by the said exposition.</p>

    <head type="sub">LOCATING THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>OMAHA, Jan. 14.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: Your article of January 12 seems to me to strike square the point, to ignore all corporate and private interests in the selection of an exposition site. A central location should be preferable by long odds. We ought to consider South Omaha's and Council Bluffs' interests also in this matter, as being equal to ours.</p>
<p>I think any one who has attempted to walk from building to building at the World's fair will thoroughly agree with you that the closer these are without overcrowding the better. The grounds can be kept in order, the approaches and walks more economically constructed and the whole get a more finished appearance in the short space of time remaining between now and the opening. Then drainage and sewerage facilities should be considered; it must be preferable to have these lead away from and not into the grounds.</p>
<p>I shall not discuss the several sites proposed, for it would take some one outside of Omaha to give disinterested advice. But I will call your attention to a piece of property lying south of "and which might be used in connection with Hanscom park;" this is a plateau running in the direction of South Omaha, and bounded by three railroad lines, viaduct south from park, over Creighton avenue; also over Union Pacific and B. &amp; M. tracks, making an entrance from Twenty-fourth street car line; there would be also the Thirty-second street car line on the west, and Twenty-second street car line on the west, and Twenty-ninth on the east. The permanent buildings could be put in Hanscom park, the water area increased, the viaducts afterward used for connecting by boulevard Hanscom, Springlake and Riverview parks, All this would enhance the value of this central, popular public resort in the future. This would give a central location, one easy of access to the general public as well as to those employed on the grounds.</p>

<head type="sub">ASKS THEM TO COME TO OMAHA NEXT YEAR</head>
<head type="sub">Only Waits the Promulgation of Rules for Admission of Exhibits and These Are Almost Ready.</head>
<p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 13.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;A draft of the State department letter to foreign governments, calling their attention to the Transmississippi and International Exposition, and inviting exhibits has been prepared and is only waiting for the printed rules and regulations governing the reception of exhibits, which the Treasury department is preparing, when it will be issued. The regulations will be identical with those for Atlanta last year. Treasury people are rushing the rules governing the reception of exhibits, and the proof of same will probably be sent Representative Mercer the last of this week, or early next week.</p>
<p>Mr. Mercer has filed with the ways and means committee the brief of the American Chicory company of Fremont and Omaha, asking for a duty of 1 cent per pound on raw, burnt or manufactured chicory, and a letter of John Brady of Kearney, representing the cereal mills of that place, asking that half a cent per pound duty be placed on oatmeal.</p>
<p>J. N. H. Patrick appeared before the Board of Fortifications and <choice><sic>Ordnance</sic><corr>Ordinance</corr></choice> yesterday in reference to a torpedo in which he is interested. He occupied about one and one-half hours in explaining the merits of his torpedo and urging upon the government its adoption. General Miles, chairman of the board presided at the meeting.</p>
<p>B. A. McAllister, land commissioner of the Union Pacific, is here urging upon the Interior department to issue patents for lands now occupied by settlers along the line of the railway, and which have been held up by the secretary because of alleged discrepancies in the bill. Mr. McAllister proposes to bring senatorial and representative influence to bear to hasten the issuance of these patents.</p>
<p>The Eleventh street viaduct case, which by decision of the supreme court is to be argued on its merits, will probably be reached a year from next March, according to court officials, unless state authorities should move for an earlier argument, which might be granted.</p>
<p>Senator Pettigrew's bill providing for the remission of payment of $1.25 per acre by those who commute entries on ceded portions of the Sioux reservation in South Dakota came up for consideration before the public lands committee of the house yesterday. Meiklejohn secured the adoption of an amendment to include that portion of the reservation in Nebraska and as amended it was reported to the house.</p>
<p>Secretary Francis has approved for patent to the state of South Dakota the following land lists: List No. 4, on account of the grant to the Institute for the Deaf and Dumb, 800 acres in the Huron district; list No. 3, public buildings grant, 4,102 acres in the Huron district; list No. 6, educational and charitable institutions grant, 39,618 acres in the Aberdeen district.</p>
<p>J. D. Corder of South Dakota has been appointed carpenter at $900 per annum at the Pine Ridge Indian agency.</p>
<p>G. M. Lamberston of Lincoln is at the Arlington. Charles A. Webber and Samuel J. Long of Lincoln are at the Wellington.</p>
<p>F. A. Brogan of Omaha is in the city.</p>

<head type="sub">President Wattles Believes that Other States Will Get in Line.</head>
<p>The news of the introduction of a bill in the Illinois legislature appropriating $100,000 to be used for defraying the expenses of an Illinois exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition was received with a great deal of satisfaction by the officers and directors of the exposition.</p>
<p>President Wattles said it was very appropriate that Illinois should make an apparition for an exhibit in view of the promptness with which the transmississippi states responded to the request of Chicago and made liberal appropriations for exhibits at the World's fair. The appropriation provided for by the bill just introduced, Mr. Wattles regarded as a very moderate one. He said he had no doubt but that several of the states outside of the transmississippi region would follow the example of Illinois. This action of Illinois he thought was especially appropriate in view of the close<unclear reason="torn"></unclear>

    <head type="main">LABOR DEMANDS A HEARING</head>
<head type="sub">IMAGINES THAT IT HAS BEEN SLIGHTED</head>
<head type="sub">Fred M. Youngs Submits a Report to Central Labor Union&#8212;Says Workingmen Are Not Fairly Treated.</head>
<div3>
<p>Transmississippi Exposition matters occupied a small but a very important portion of the regular meeting of the Central Labor union last night. They were brought up just before adjournment in a report which was presented to the body by Fred M. Youngs, a member of the Transmississippi Exposition directory, who is looked upon as labor's representative on that body. The report was as follows:</p>
<p>At a meeting of the board held December 26 a vacancy occurred, causing by the recognition of John A. Wakefield. I placed in nomination William Bell of the Painters' union, who had been endorsed by labor, and strenuously urged his election. Out of thirty-nine votes cast Mr. Bell received two votes. At the same meeting the executive committee presented a set of by-laws, which were adopted, in which there was a clause giving the executive board full and unlimited power to transact all business of the corporation. Believing the board of directors should at once make such provisions as would prevent hasty action of a committee of seven letting contracts without first submitting them for the approval of the full board, I introduced the following resolution:</p>
<p>"Resolved, That all questions of paramount importance and the letting of all large contracts for buildings, grading, etc., shall be submitted to the board of directors for approval before final action is taken thereon."</p>
<p>This resolution was hotly attacked by members of the executive committee, and a motion to adopt was lost by a large majority. At a meeting of the directory held January 9 developments showed that all power was fast being relegated from the board of directors to the executive committee, or Board of Managers, as they are now self-styled, and that, after the location question is settled, this committee of seven will have full and unlimited powers; the other forth-three directors will be simply honorary members, or, in more suitable terms, "figure heads." I thought it advisable to bring the labor issue to a head, and put the board on record as to what disposition they would show toward the protection of home labor at living wages, believing that if we failed with the full board, it would be useless to expect anything from the executive committee, and your honorable body would then know the result in time to take the proper steps for the protection of labor, in the state legislature or by other means; therefore, I introduced the following resolution, and advocated its adoption to the best of my ability:</p>
<p>"Resolved, That all contracts entered into by this board, its officers or agents, for work pertaining to the Transmississippi and International Exposition, must stipulate therein that resident labor of Douglas county&#8212;skilled and unskilled&#8212;shall be given preference over all others, and that unskilled labor shall be paid no less than $1.50 per day; provided that the said stipulation shall not apply to works prosecuted by other states or outside interests."</p>
<p>The resolution had the same effect on some of the board as would the throwing of a bomb, and was bitterly opposed by some of the executive board and the capitalists, who could bring no better argument against it than the claim that it would frustrate the getting of appropriations from Nebraska and other state legislatures. I called their attention to the fact that the resolution provided that the stipulations should not affect appropriations outside of Douglas county. My efforts were of no avail, and the resolution was committed to the tender care of the executive committee, which was a polite way of killing it. Hearing rumors of the disastrous results to labor of the late Atlanta exposition, caused by lack of protection, and discrimination against home labor, I wrote to Robert W. McGinley of Atlanta, who was an active member of the Atlanta Central Labor union at the time of their exposition, and asked him for the facts as to the position of labor. I herewith attach a copy of his reply, which plainly shows that unless home labor is not properly protected by proper legislation an exposition will be a curse instead of a blessing to the labor classes, as it will bring them into competition with the idle, cheap labor of the country, which will lower wages to such an extent that it will take years to regain. Feeling that labor will be powerless to accomplish anything in the way of protective legislation in the Board of Directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition I believe it my duty to place the Central Labor union in possession of the true state of affairs in time to enable it to use other means of self-protection.</p>
</div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">INDIGNATION EXPRESSED.</head>
<p>Attached to this report was the copy of a letter from Robert W. McGinley of Atlanta, Ga., who was a member of the Central Labor union of that city, when the exposition was held.</p>
<p>The report gave rise to expressions of indignation from several members of the union. No debate, however, was held upon it on account of the lateness of the hour. The report will be made the special order of business for a special meeting next Wednesday evening. There was some objection at first to receiving the report from Youngs, because he was not a member of the union. It was finally accepted, however. After the reading a motion was unanimously passed making Youngs an honorary member of the body, and he was requested to furnish the body with future reports.</p>
<p>The union took no action on the proposed amendment to the exemption laws of the state, which is being advocated by the Retail Dealers' association. The amendment provides that only $50 of any person's salary shall be exempt from garnishment. The bill was referred to a committee to report at the next meeting.</p>
<p>No action was taken on a proposed amendment by which material men and laborers are given a lien upon material furnished and used by horseshoers, blacksmiths, wagon and carriage builders. This also was referred to a committee.</p>
<p>A bill, offered by the Horseshoers' union, was endorsed. It provided from the appointment of a state board of five, to be known as the Farrier's board, which shall examine horseshoers and blacksmiths and issue licenses to them.</p>
<p>A communication was received from the American Federation of Musicians, urging the establishment of a local musicians' union in this city. It was reported that the musicians are preparing to join the federation of labor.</p>
<p>The following delegates were received into the body: W. C. Turner, R. E. Shipley and C. C. Vaughn of Omaha Typographical union, No. 190; H. E. Easton, Robert Richelieu and William Hill of Omaha lodge No. 31, International Association of Machinists; William B. Austin, Frank Gotham and John L. Miller, Omaha Stationary Engineers' Protective association; William Grabach, B. B. Schmidt and Charles Porter, local lodge No. 42, National Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employes.</p>
<p>It was announced that the local plumbers' union had been set on its feet again by the addition of seventeen members. The body will shortly be asked to send delegates to the Central Labor union.</p>
<p>James B. Wood of Chicago, general organizer of the International Cigarmakers' union, and David Heimerdinger of New York, general organizer of the Federation of Labor, made remarks on the use of the union label. The former will address a mass meeting of laboring men at the Temple Saturday night.</p></div3></div2>
    
<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">TRANSMISSISSIPPI EXPOSITION.</head>    
<head type="sub">Hearty Commendation from a Southern Newspaper.</head>
<ab>Atlanta Constitution.</ab>
<p>While every movement which seeks to develop the resources of the country is a matter of national interest, regardless of the section in which it may be located, the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha, Neb., next year is of more than ordinary significance.</p>
<p>Aside from illustrating the varied resources of the country along industrial, scientific and agricultural lines of progress, it will be the first exposition of this kind ever held west of the Mississippi river.</p>
<p>There is a marvelous record of growth condensed in this simple statement. Only a few years ago the great western half of the continent was a barren wilderness, occupied by tribes of savage Indians. Today, however, it belongs to civilization in the broadest and best meaning of that term. It is the home of a thrifty, progressive and enterprising people, who have put their energies into its soil and made it the imperial granary of the nation. It is also the abode of manufacturing industry, as the progress of the west during the past few years abundantly shows.</p>
<p>The movement to hold an exposition in Omaha was inaugurated several months ago. The enterprise has steadily grown in magnitude, however, until now the plan of the incorporators is to hold an exposition which will be colossal and world-wide in its character. That the exposition will be a pronounced success is evident not only from the varied and infinite resources of the west, but in a still higher degree, from the sleepless and unremitting activities of our transmississippi brethren.</p>
<p>The authorized capital of the Transmississippi and International Exposition company is fixed at $1,000,000. Of this sum $400,000 has already been subscribed, while the balance will be raised within the next six months. It is understood that the legislature of Nebraska has been asked to appropriate $250,000, and that indications point to a favorable consideration of this request. Last June a measure was adopted in congress appropriating $200,000 toward a government exhibit, and there is some likelihood that this appropriation will be increased during the present session.</p>
<p>It is needless to assure our western brethren that the sympathies of the south are most cordially enlisted in this great enterprise. Between the two sections there are many strong ties of natural interest and affection. Especially is this true in the relationship which exists between Georgia and Nebraska, and to say that Georgia wishes her sister state godspeed in her mammoth undertaking is, in a measure, superfluous.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the Omaha exposition which conflicts in the least with the great industrial enterprise to be held in Nashville this year. They occur at different times, and, while they are both international in scope, like our own exposition two years ago, their purpose is to advance the welfare of the country and to make it a still greater blessing to the world. The entire south therefore, cordially unites in wishing <note>article ends abruptly</note></p></div2>

The customs division of the Treasury department in replying to a letter of Secretary John A. Wakefield, of the Transmississippi Exposition, relative to the bonding of the exposition for the care and custody of goods in bond, addressed a letter to Representative Mercer today, in which the department states that the act is ample for all purposes of the exposition, but if additional provisions are needed, they will be taken care of in the regulations of the Treasury department. "Every privilege which has been enjoyed by previous expositions will be included in the arrangements to be made by this department for the exposition referred to," is the concluding paragraph of the letter.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">EXPOSITION GROWS IN FAVOR</head>
<head type="sub">LEGISLATORS TAKE UP WITH THE IDEA</head>
<head type="sub">Dudley Smith's Bill Has Many Warm Friends Already, but Will Meet Many Amendments on Its Way.</head>
<p>LINCOLN, Jan. 15.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Despite the frantic assertions of a few opponents of the proposal to appropriate a sufficient sum of money from the state treasury to enable the state of Nebraska to make a creditable showing at the Transmississippi Exposition, the fact yet remains that the preposition is growing in favor among the members of the legislature. The bill introduced by Representative Dudley Smith of Omaha, although not yet out of the printer's hands, is already the topic of the conversation in legislative circles in Lincoln. It is developing some warm friends among the populist members, although all do not agree with all the expressed terms of the bill. Many amendments will doubtless be offered, and already some practical suggestions are talked of.</p>
<p>Ex-Senator H. G. Stewart of Dawes county, one of the best known middle-of-the-road populists of the state, for two terms a senator from his district and assistant secretary of the senate at the present session, said this morning that, generally speaking, he was in favor of the appropriation. He believed that the provision making the twelve state directors members of the regular Board of Directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition company was a very wise one, and that it would enable the state to secure better returns for the money invested than if a commission were appointed to act independent of the Exposition company. Under the plan adopted in making the appropriation for the Nebraska exhibit at the World's fair, said Senator Stewart, a large proportion of the money was dissipated in the payment of the salaries and expense of a great many officials. Senator Stewart is of the opinion, however, that the state should secure some tangible return for the money voted to the exposition. He suggested that a provision be inserted in the bill requiring the Exposition company to donate to the state at the close of the fair some of the larger buildings, to be used for the benefit of the people of the state. In order to give his idea practical form he suggested that it might be a wise move to either locate the big fair on the State fair grounds or remove the fair grounds permanently to a point nearer the city of Omaha, and by locating the Exposition buildings upon the new site give to the state of Nebraska some permanent buildings for State fair purposes that would make the State fair the superior of any held in the United States. He also suggested that at least one of the

<pb n="30" xml:id="TMISB02-030"/>



buildings, if constructed of structural iron, be removed to the city of Lincoln to be used as a part of the equipment of the University of Nebraska. One of the Exposition buildings, he thought, could be designed in such a manner that all of the permanent structural portion could be admirably used for one of the large buildings at the university.</p> 
<p>Another suggestion made by Senator Stewart was that the bill should contain a provision requiring the Exposition management to devote a portion of the money appropriated to a model irrigation farm of at least forty acres. Upon this farm should be planted various crops, all to be placed in the hands of practical irrigation men who would show the immense advantages of irrigation through the entire season.</p>
<p>Senator Stewart is one of the leaders of the populist party and comes from a section of the state where the prevailing business depression pinches the hardest. He is, nevertheless, favorable to an appropriation commensurate with the importance and dignity of the state. But, he says, that, as far as his people are concerned, they feel that the state should have some tangible return for the money the state proposes to invest.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">ILLINOIS IS DEEPLY INTERESTED.</head>
<head type="sub">Senator Crawford's Bill for Representation Has Strong Support.</head>
<p>CHICAGO, Jan. 15.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Senator Crawford yesterday introduced into the senate at Springfield a bill providing for the participation of the state of Illinois in the Transmississippi and International Exposition, and for the appropriation of $100,000 for that purpose. The bill contemplates the appointment by the governor of three commissioners, who are to receive not to exceed $2,000 each for their expenses, and for the appointment of a salaried secretary. It also provides for the erection of the proper state buildings.</p>
<p>Senator Crawford is one of the oldest Chicago members of the upper house and is usually a member of the steering committee, which practically controls the right-of-way of all bills on the calendar. As yet no committees have been appointed in either branch of the legislature, it being the understanding that the complete organization will be deferred until the senatorial fight is out of the way. This bill has been very fortunate in being introduced at this time, and in fact it is the only bill of general interest so far introduced in either house. The representative of the exposition having the matter in charge has enjoyed the friendship of all factions and avoided identification with any particular candidacy.</p>
<p>Before Senator Crawford would consent to introduce and champion the bill it was necessary to show him that influential commercial and railroad interests in Illinois were favorable thereto. The senator himself is strongly in favor of the bill and will guard its interests at every stage. It is understood that already the knowledge of this contemplated action on the part of Illinois has started a movement in St. Louis looking to similar action on the part of the Missouri legislature, as St. Louis has trade interests that cannot afford to stay out with Chicago in. </p>
<p>This action in Illinois should stir up all the western states, and surely Nebraska must, in comparison with this amount, grant all that is being asked in the way of an appropriation at this session in Lincoln.</p></div2>
    
<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">PLANS OF THE COLORED PEOPLE.</head>    
<head type="sub">Propose a Department at the Transmississippi Exposition.</head>
<p>The colored population of the city is desirous of having a department and exhibit of its own at the Transmississippi Exposition. The plans are as yet in embryo, but the first steps have been taken.</p>
<p>The negro exhibit at the Atlanta exposition is responsible for the idea. The matter was first proposed at a meeting of colored men which was held in the office of Dr. M. O. Ricketts last Wednesday night, although it had been quietly worked up for some time past. The meeting was attended by about twenty of the prominent colored men of the city. The evening was spent in talking over plans, but nothing definite was done. A committee, consisting of M. F. Singleton, A. W. Parker and Fred L. Smith, was appointed to obtain information of the exhibit that was held at Atlanta. Another committee, composed of T. P. Manhamitt, J. Tucker and W. B. Watson, was selected to secure similar information regarding the exhibit that is to be made at the Nashville exposition this year. A third committee consisting of A. D. White, Joseph Carr and George E. Collins, was appointed to gather statistics of the colored race resident in the transmississippi states. Another meeting will be held Thursday night, January 28.</p>
<p>It is the intention to have a separate building of some character on the exposition grounds. It is more than probable that the educational progress of the race will be made the principal feature of the exhibit. In addition, however, the department will show the present condition of the colored people of the west. It is believed that if such an exhibit can be arranged, a number of conventions of colored people can be induced to meet in this city during the exposition year. Among these are mentioned the supreme lodge of the Colored Branch of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Colored Women's Federated Clubs, the Colored Workers of the Episcopal church and the grand lodge of Colored Masons of this state, Kansas and Missouri.</p>

<div2 type="article"><dateline>THE OMAHA DAILY BEE: SATURDAY, JANUARY 16, 1897.</dateline>
    <head type="sub">VOICE OF TRANSMISSISSIPPI PRESS.</head>
<p>Sioux City Tribune: Mr. E. Rosewater, editor of The Omaha Bee, and manager of the Department of Publicity of the Transmississippi Exposition, has begun his work of publication of the exhibition, which is to be an exposition of the resources and products of the states west of the Mississippi, to be held in the City of Omaha in 1898. No doubt it will be a great thing for Omaha if it is a success, and pending its opening it will be a great source of encouragement to the people of that city.</p>
<p>So. Louis Republic: Omaha is vigorously preparing its Transmississippi and International Exposition for 1898. Since it is the first great exposition attempted beyond the Missouri, all the western states will lend their warm interest and best efforts in aid of the Omaha enterprise. The Nebraska legislature will appropriate $250,000 this winter. With the appropriation by congress the funds will be ample for an elaborate affair. The Omaha exposition will be one of the marked features of next year.</p>
<p>Cedar Rapids Republican: The Transmississippi and International Exposition association is putting forth its best efforts for an exposition in 1898, and Mr. Edward Rosewater of The Omaha Bee, who is manager of the Department of Publicity, states that the association proposes to focalize attention upon the marvelous resources and capabilities of the transmississippi states, as distinguished from the monopoly of the Columbian exposition by foreign exhibitors. There is every reason why the Omaha project should receive the co-operation and support of the entire country, and particularly of the part west of the great river. The fact that Nebraska has been captured politically by the populists has undoubtedly militated to decrease the interest which was first felt in the scheme, but it must be remembered that the populists are invariably better talkers than workers. If the Transmississippi Exposition becomes a reality and a success it will be through the efforts of men like Mr. Rosewater, who are business men in the highest and best sense of the term. The men who are behind this exposition in Nebraska should not be made to suffer for faults which are not their own. There is no question but such an exposition will be a great benefit to Iowa, as well as many other states. The government has made a small appropriation of $200,000 for an exhibit, and the legislature of Nebraska is expected to appropriate as much or more. Until the latter has pledged itself it is not likely any very positive steps will be taken elsewhere, but the Republican expects to see the exposition go forward to a profitable and successful culmination.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Herald: The proposed International Exposition to be held at Omaha may now hot only be put down as a fixed fact, but it gives promise of being one of the most complete and extensive exhibits of the resources and products of this country that was ever made. Let everybody give the enterprise a boost, and then when it opens in 1898 go and take it all in.</p>
<p>San Francisco Chronicle: The Transmississippi and International Exposition, which is to be held in Omaha in 1898, deserves the attention and encouragement of Californians. It will afford the producers of this state an excellent opportunity to introduce their specialities to the people of a large and rapidly growing section of the country, and whatever may be said by the unreflecting, such opportunities are not to be despised. It is not always easy to trace to their source the causes that contribute to the popularity of natural or artificial products in remote places, but there can be no doubt whatever that the chief of them is judicious advertisement, and no better method of advertising in distant places could be designed than an exposition which permits the products of different sections to be placed in competition. Such a competition Californians may enter upon with confidence. Their experience in the past has taught them that in most lines they need not fear rivalry, and in many they may court it.</p>
<p>Some idea of the scope of the proposed Transmississippi and International Exposition may be gained from the fact that those who are promoting the affair have paid California the compliment to inquire particularly into the management of the Midwinter International Exposition, with a view to profiting by our experience. In response to an inquiry for information the published history of the Midwinter fair was sent to the board of directors of the Transmississippi Exposition. Acknowledging the receipt of this, the secretary, John A. Wakefield remarked:</p>
<p>"We have the history of the Midwinter exposition, and I want to say, in this connection, that in all the histories of expositions which it has been my pleasure to inspect, there is only one which seems to be real, sure enough history, and that is the Midwinter. It is the only one which gives any clear financial showing whatever. Mr. Higinbotham of the World's Columbian exposition writes me that the financial history of the World's Columbian exposition will be issued from the press of Appleton's some time during the year 1897, or four years after the close of the exposition. The promptness of the financial statement contained in the Midwinter history is, by comparison, all the more complimentary."</p>
<p>That the compliment was not entirely undeserved may be gathered from the added statement that the history above referred to was in the hands of the printer within six weeks of the close of the fair, and that it was published in elaborate form before the end of the year 1894, the Midwinter exposition having terminated on the 4th of July of that year. Some one may suggest that the Midwinter fair should not be compared with the colossal Columbian World's fair, but it must be remembered that while the Chicago exposition was on a grander scale than California's show, it also had much larger corps of accountants and other attaches than the latter. But the most remarkable instance of dilatoriness is that furnished by the Centennial exposition, which did not complete its history until nearly nineteen years after the close of the fair. So on the whole it may be said if the projectors of the Transmississippi Exposition conduct their fair on the lines of the California Midwinter International exposition they will make no serious mistake.</p>
<p>Las Vegas (N. M.) Daily Optic: The Transmississippi Commercial congress, held in November, 1895, declared in favor of an exposition of the resources and products of the states west of the Mississippi, to be held in the city of Omaha in 1898. To carry out this project the Transmississippi and International Exposition association was incorporated, with an authorized capital of $1,000,000, of which over $400,000 has already been raised and the remainder will doubtless be secured in the next six months. In June last congress passed a bill granting recognition to the Transmississippi and International Exposition, pledging not less than $200,000 toward a government exhibit. It is confidently expected that the appropriation will be increased during the coming session to $500,000. The legislature of Nebraska, at its biennial session this month, will be asked to appropriate at least $250,000, and the management is assured by the governor and incoming members that this request will be complied with.</p>    
<p>Salt Lake City News: An interesting topic for legislative consideration on the part of the Transmississippi states and territories now comes forward in the Transmississippi and International Exposition, to be held in Omaha, Neb., between June 1 and November 1, 1898. It is an outcome of the declaration of the Transmississippi congress, held in 1895, which recorded itself in favor of such an exposition. The project was taken hold of by an organization in which each of the states and territories west of the Mississippi is represented by a vice president. The national government and various legislatures were asked for an appropriation. Iowa contributed $10,000 for preliminary work; other states have pledged liberal aid, and congress appropriated $200,000 on certain conditions that have been complied with. This year Nebraska is asked to contribute $300,000, congress will be requested to donate a like sum, and all the Transmississippi states and territories are being urged to make appropriations to aid in the project.</p>
<p>Such an exposition for the section of country west of the Mississippi, which comprises two-thirds of the area of the United States with wonderful possibilities in the future development of its resources, cannot fail to be of vast benefit to the entire region that is to be given representation. When exhibitions are held by states locally, the advantages gained by mutual association and competition of various sections are readily discernible, and in no way more perfectly than by the increased activity which is awakened among the producers within the state, who are inspired to renewed efforts for better results, and find encouragement in the fact that their productions thus become known and appreciated throughout the state. The Omaha Exposition means the extension of the advantages to all the transmississippi region and they are of such importance to each individual state and territory that none can afford to be left out or to be represented in meager or niggardly fashion.</p>
<p>In this state the legislature this year may be asked to further consider the semi-centennial celebration of the state to be held in this city in July next. At the same time it will not do to ignore the projects of the succeeding year in the line of exhibitions, hence the event at Omaha may be looked to receive consideration of a favorable character. That much may be regarded as a certainty. As to the detail of what the state may be expected to do, it might be premature to discuss that in advance of Governor Wells' recommendations on the subject, which has been invited to his attention in his message to the legislature. But there is no reason to fear that executive and legislators will not give the Transmississippi Exposition of 1898 the consistent, friendly, effective attention which its importance to this state requires from that source.</p>

<p>Ottumwa Courier: Omaha is making great preparations for the Transmississippi and International Exposition that is to be held in that city from June 1 to November 1, 1898. It is <choice><sic>propoesd</sic><corr>proposed</corr></choice> at this exposition to focalize attention upon the marvelous resources and capabilities of the transmississippi states, something that was not done at the Columbian exposition because of the fact that the latter was largely monopolized by foreign exhibitors. The <choice><sic>coruoration</sic><corr>corporation</corr></choice> having the exposition in charge has <choice><sic>elready</sic><corr>already</corr></choice> subscribed $400,000 of the $1,000,000 capital. The state of Nebraska is expected to appropriate $250,000 toward a government exhibit. Iowa will be asked to participate and she will certainly do so in a liberal manner.</p>
<p>Dubuque Daily Times: An effort is being made to incite interest in the exposition which the Transmississippi Commercial congress, at its meeting in November, 1895, decided to hold in Omaha in 1898. The people of Omaha and Nebraska and all those interested in the development of the western country are lending the project their aid and exerting themselves to further it.</p>
<p>The plan is to have the exposition strictly what its name implies it should be, an exhibit of the marvelous resources and capabilities of the states west of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>It is true these states were represented at the Columbian exposition, but for the reason so many foreign exhibits were there those from the transmississippi states were merely incidental to the display. In the 1898 exposition at Omaha it is desired to give the products and advantages of the western states the prominence they deserve. It is desired to make the exposition a grand affair, in keeping with the great rich territory it is sought to exploit. In order to do this aid from the government and all the western states will be asked and it is expected their response will be speedy and cor- <note>sentence ends abruptly.</note></p>
<p>To carry out the project the Transmississippi and International Exposition association was incorporated last winter with a capital stock of $1,000,000, $400,000 of which has already been raised.</p>
<p>In June last congress recognized the importance of the project by passing a bill pledging not less than $200,000 for a government exhibit. This, it is confidently expected by the <choice><sic>managemtn</sic><corr>management</corr></choice>, will be increased to $500,000. In Nebraska an appropriation has been vigorously agitated with the result that the governor and incoming members have given the assurance that a bill for the appropriation of $250,000 will be adopted at the session of the legislature which convenes this winter.</p>
<p>With this much accomplished those in charge of the exposition feel certain of its success and with the cordial co-operation there is every warrant to expect from the other states it should be all in magnificence that can be expected.</p>
<p>Iowa is interested in this project and it should awaken to its importance to this state. If the other states do manifest the interest it is expected and assured they will Iowa wants to be as well represented.</p>
<p>Such an exposition as is contemplated offers an exceptional opportunity for displaying the resources of the state and it is certain a liberal appropriation by the legislature, making an exhibit that would reflect credit on the state possible, would result in benefits many times the value of the money expended.</p>
<p>Milbank, S. D., Herald-Advance: The Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898 promises to be a most successful means of advertising the western states. Already great preparations are under way to make the exposition the most important ever instituted in the northwest.</p>
<p>Duluth News-Tribune: Omaha is looking forward with proper pride to the Transmississippi Commercial congress, which is to be held in that city in 1898, between June 1 and November 1. This exposition is designed to afford an opportunity for the states west of the Mississippi to make an exhibit of their resources and productive industries, and the showing should be remarkable. These states and territories cover an area of more than 2,500,000 square miles, and represent fully twenty billions of wealth. They are the great granary of America, and contain within their boundaries practically all the gold and silver mines of the United States, besides other deposits of incalculable volume and value. They embrace the greatest bodies of timber on the North American continent, as well as a large portion of the cotton belt, and all of the sugar-producing lands.</p>
<p>In the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 the exhibits of the transmississippi states were overshadowed by the exhibits of foreign countries. Of the millions who passed through its gates, comparatively few carried away with them a distinct impression of the productive resources of that vast empire. The purpose of the projectors of the Transmississippi Exposition is to acquaint the nation and visitors from other countries with the fabulous wealth and stupendous possibilities of the great west. To carry out this project the Transmississippi and International Exposition association was incorporated last winter, with an authorized capital of $1,000,000, of which over $400,000 has already been raised and the remainder will doubtless be secured within the next six months. In June last congress passed a bill granting recognition to the Transmississippi and International Exposition, pledging not less than $200,000 toward a government exhibit. It is expected that the appropriation will be increased during the coming session to half a million dollars. The legislature of Nebraska, at its biennial session in January, will be asked to appropriate at least $250,000, and assurance has been received that the aid will be granted.</p>
<p>Oelrichs (S. D.) Times: T. F. Wells, who is on the Omaha Exposition board as a vice president from South Dakota, has been doing some good work for this state in preparing for the big exposition. He has been called to Omaha, to confer with the board and expects to be at the meetings there a few days this week. He is also hopeful of getting an appropriation through the legislature this winter to assist this state in making a good showing at the coming fair.</p>
<p>Denver Republican: A board of directors having been chosen for the Omaha Exposition, that enterprise many be considered as fairly launched. The prospect for its success is good in view of the improved outlook for better business in the far west. Colorado will be glad to take part in it and make an exhibit of its products and resources that will present a true picture of the industrial strength of this state.</p>
<p>St. Louis Star-Sayings: Arrangements for numerous expositions to be held between now and the close of the century are in progress, but in none of them is St. Louis and the entire west so greatly interested as in the Transmississippi and International Exposition, which will be held in Omaha in 1898, from June 1 to November 1.</p>
<p>The Exposition is designed to afford an opportunity for the states west of the Mississippi to make an exhibition of their resources and productive industries. Twenty states and territories are embraced as the Transmississippi region. These states and territories cover an area of more than 2,500,000 miles, with an aggregate population of nearly 25,000,000. They represent fully $20,000,000,000 of wealth. They are the great granaries of America, and contain within their boundary practically all the gold and silver mines in the United States. These states and territories embrace the greatest bodies of timber on the North American continent, as well as a large portion of the cotton belt and sugar producing lines within the Union. The railroads within the Transmississippi states aggregate 65,000 miles, an the navigable waterways include the greatest of the American rivers, the Mississippi, the Missouri and the Columbia. </p>
<p>During the World's Columbian exposition of 1893, the exhibits of the transmississippi states were overshadowed by the exhibits of foreign countries. Furthermore, of the millions who passed through its gates, comparatively few of them saw anything of the great transmississippi west, or carried away with them any distinct impression of the productive resources of this vast empire. The purpose of the projectors of the Transmississippi Exposition, therefore, is to acquaint the nations and visitors from other countries with the fabulous wealth and stupendous possibilities of the greater west.</p>
<p>To carry out the project of this great exposition an association has been incorporated with a capital of $1,000,000, of which over $400,000 has already been raised. The last congress passed a bill pledging not less than $200,000 toward a government exhibit, and it is hoped that the present session will raise this greatly. The legislature of Nebraska will probably donate $250,000, and it can readily be seen that the exposition will necessarily = be a stupendous affair.</p>
<p>While it is still early, comparatively, it behooves St. Louis and the state of Missouri, through its legislature, to take suitable action toward being represented in this great display, which we confidently believe will be second only, if at all, to the great Columbian exposition, which overshadowed anything of the kind previously held.</p>
<p>Daily Statesman, Boise, Idaho: Those in charge of the exposition proposed to be held in Omaha next year are conducting an active campaign for the purpose of enlisting public interest in the undertaking, and the prospects are that the west will give itself heartily to support of the enterprise. The status of the project is given in a letter to the Statesman from the manager of the Department of Publicity, in which he says:</p>
<p>"The Transmississippi Commercial <choice><sic>comgress</sic><corr>congress</corr></choice>, held in November, 1895, declared in favor of an exposition of the resources and products of the states west of the Mississippi, to be held in the city of Omaha in 1898.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the executive committee of the Trans-Mississippi directory yesterday afternoon the department of promotion, through Manager Hitchcock, reported that letters had been sent to 2,119 members of western legislatures, asking them to support the bills introduced and to be introduced in aid of the exposition. Replies have been received from about 150, and the majority of them express themselves as in favor of the project. The South Dakota bill calls for an appropriation of $20,000; the California bill, $70,000, and the Nebraska bill, $350,000. Bills that have been sent to the legislatures of other states call for appropriation each of $100,000. It was announced that no state appropriation could be expected from Texas, as there is a constitutional <choice><sic>provisioin</sic><corr>provision</corr></choice> against it. The state made no appropriation for the World's fair, but was well done, and confidence was expressed that the same course would be taken with regard to the Trans-Mississippi exposition.</p>

Consequently it was after 11 o'clock before Wooster of Merrick moved that at the hearing of the Transmississippi Exposition matter next Thursday evening the opponents of the bill be given equal time by the finance, ways and means committee with those who favored the measure. On this motion Wooster made his longest speech of the session, plainly indicating that when the time came he would be found with the opponents of the measure. Hull of Harlan said that the hearing should be held for the benefit of those who favored the bill. Wimberley of Lancaster was of the opinion, however, that Wooster's motion was all right, and when a vote was taken it was found that a large majority were with him.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Department Heads Report a Satisfactory Progress of Their Work.</head>
<p>The regular weekly meeting of the executive committee of the Transmississippi and International Exposition was held at the Commercial club rooms at noon yesterday, the new quarters of the exposition in the Paxton block not being ready for occupancy.</p>
<p>A general discussion of the needs of the several departments in the way of furniture in the new offices developed the fact that some of the local furniture houses have volunteered to fit up certain of the offices free of cost. A list of the furniture which will be required was made up by each of the managers, and the whole was referred to the chairman of the committee, and the secretary, with authority to buy such furniture as is needed, or to accept any offers which may be made by patriotic firms.</p>
<p>On the recommendation of Manager Lindsey of the ways and means department O. H. Snyder of Plattsmouth was appointed as storekeeper of supplies.</p>
<p>Manager Rosewater of the department of publicity submitted a report of the operations of his department, showing that the amount of space devoted to the exposition by papers, both in and out of the transmississippi region, is very much larger than was anticipated, and that the character of the notices was all that could be wished. The work of the department was reviewed and the committee was informed regarding contemplated plans.</p>
<p>On the recommendation of Mr. Rosewater, Max Adler was appointed to the press bureau to prepare articles for publication in German in the large German newspapers of the country.</p>
<p>Manager Hitchcock of the department of promotion reported that his department had been in correspondence with members of all the legislatures in the western states and had received replies of a more or less encouraging nature from all of the states, indicating that the feeling in those states toward the exposition is of a friendly nature. He also reported that bills have been introduced in the legislature of South Dakota, California and Nebraska making appropriations for an exhibit. Mr. Hitchcock said he had information from the other transmississippi states to the effect that similar bills would be introduced in each of them within the next few days.</p>
<p>Manager Bruce of the department of exhibits had no report to make except that his department is prepared to send out 100,000 blank forms of application for space for exhibits and would commence that work within a few days. For that purpose he asked authority to employ one stenographer and one junior clerk, both of whom would be employed jointly by the department of concessions. The authority was granted.</p>
<p>Manager Reed of the department of concessions reported that he would require the services of one clerk, as the correspondence of his department is becoming very heavy. He recommended that Jay Burns be appointed to that position and his recommendation was endorsed.</p>
<p>The committee then adjourned for one week.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">LOCATING THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>OMAHA, Jan. 16.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: I wish to call the attention of those interested in selecting the site for the Transmississippi Exposition to a few figures, in regard to the transportation of the visitors from the exposition ground to the center of the city, if located in Miller or Elmwood park, or in Riverview park or the Hanscom park site. Taking as an average daily attendance of from 30,000 to 50,000 persons, and supposing the street car company would run fifty trains of one motor and one trailer, each train carrying 100 people, from the exposition ground to Farnam street, the run from either Miller or Elmwood park will take not less than one hour, whereas, from the Riverview or the Hanscom park site, eighteen to twenty minutes is the time required. The fifty trains do here the service requiring 150 on the distant sites, and it is not only the difference in the number of cars required, but being in the heated season, you know how disagreeable it is to be jammed in for one hours, when for twenty minutes one does not mind it so much. At 6 o'clock almost everybody would want to come home. From 6 to 7 o'clock only 5,000 could leave via street car, if located in the two distant sites, whereas, in the others 15,000 could be landed in the center of the city.</p>
<p>To double the attendance locate the exposition as convenient and centrally as possible. A CITIZEN.</p>
    
<p>OMAHA, Jan. 17.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: The merits of Miller park as a location for the Transmississippi Exposition have been thoroughly aired for several months, while so far, little or nothing has been said or written as to the advantages of the site adjoining Hanscom park. It is located right in the city, within walking distance of the business center,and also within easy walking distance of two-thirds of the population of Omaha and South Omaha. It is accessible on all sides over paved streets and good sidewalks. There is sufficient land available to accommodate all the necessities of the exposition; the ground in its natural condition is peculiarly adapted for the purpose and with reasonable expense can be made very attractive. A one and one-half mile circle, struck from Thirty-third and Pacific streets, takes in nearly all of Omaha, and part of South Omaha, while the same circle from Miller park as a center, hardly reaches the extreme northern residence portion of this city, and to all in the north part of Omaha, south of Kountze Place, the Hanscom park site is more convenient than Miller park. Locating the exposition at this place would certainly add enormously to the revenue, as so many people within walking distance would visit the fair many times, where once or twice would satisfy them were they compelled to make a street car or railway journey in order to reach it. Besides, all visitors to the exposition being right in the city, would spend some time in the business portions, and consequently, benefit the merchants. The people have subscribed liberally, expecting returns in the way of substantial benefits to Omaha, and a difference of a few thousand dollars in landscape work, water or sewer service, should not influence the directory in the selection of a site.</p>
<p>If we are to have an exposition at Omaha, let us have it in Omaha, and not five miles in the country, accessible only over unpaved country roads. JOHN M'DONALD.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">ENDORSE THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>Litchfield Mirror: One of the important duties of the state legislature is to make a liberal appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition. Already subscriptions have been taken amounting to over $400,000, and congress has pledged not less than $200,000 for a government exhibit. The various transmississippi <choice><sic>state</sic><corr>states</corr></choice> are looking for Nebraska to set the pace, and the participation of the former is assured if Nebraska comes to the front with a liberal appropriation. Kem's hostility to the proposition will have very little weight with the business body of our legislators, who will readily comprehend the advantage to Nebraska by having a successful exposition within her borders.</p>
<p>Perkins County Herald-Sentinel: When the legislature gets down to business one of the first things it should do is to make a suitable appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898. Congress has promised a donation of not less than $200,000 for a government exhibit, and private subscriptions to the amount of $400,000 have been subscribed toward pushing the exposition along. Now let Nebraska come forward with a suitable amount and it will be an assured success. The magnitude of the undertaking can scarcely be comprehended, but when the people of Omaha undertake anything they generally make a success of it, and with the assistance of every Nebraskan it will be one of the most wonderful developments of western progress of the time. By all means let us lend a helping hand and make the exposition a success.</p>
<p>Cedar Bluffs Standard: The Transmississippi Exposition must be made a success. Every citizen should stand up for Nebraska and lend his aid to make it a success. The present legislature would do a wise thing in making a reasonable appropriation to further this splendid enterprise. The state will receive it back many fold.</p>
<p>Platte County Times: Senator Allen introduced a bill Thursday to increase the amount appropriated for the government exhibit at the Omaha exposition from $150,000 to $200,000; also to increase the amount <choice><sic>appropriaed</sic><corr>appropriated</corr></choice> for government buildings from $50,000 to $75,000. We hope the bill will pass. The government should set a commendable example for the states in the transmississippi country. And now let our own legislature come to the front handsomely. All Nebraska is interested.</p>
<p>Curtis Courier: Time makes all things even. The long array of adverse conditions that have for a series of years tended to cloud the natural and acquired advantages of the great commonwealth of Nebraska are slowly but surely being dissipated, and the light of a new era is already beginning to dawn upon our fair state. By reason of the quick, perceptive faculties of the strong commercial combine of our expanding cities, Omaha and Lincoln, coupled with the alert and active delegation in congress, at stupendous developing factor, which at first seemingly only existed as a mythical uncertainty, has finally assumed form and forceful dimensions which even today in its infantile days gives promise of becoming a second "Atlas," whose mission shall only cease when the state of Nebraska shall have gathered a garland of deserved honors such as any state in our proud galaxy of stars might well feel proud to secure. Local subscriptions amounting to $400,000 have already been pledged, while congress has signified its willingness to appropriate nearly $250,000 more to equip the governmental exhibit which is to stand with the interstate displays. The people of Nebraska should now be fully alive to the golden opportunity thus presented. Our people, one and all should by a universal consensus of action, by both word and deed, aim to make the present occasion the one great future developing impetus which shall bring men and money for years to come into the state to participate in the general prosperity sure to follow such a showing as Nebraska can, without boasting, make before the world. The state legislature, rising to the true dignity that such an unbounded opportunity presents to materially enhance all our commercial, industrial and agricultural interests, should stand ready to liberally endow the executive board with authority and a generous appropriation to assist the great work along. Westward the course of empire takes its way, and ere long the clanging bells of time shall proclaim that Nebraska is not only the geographical center of the United States, but the center as well of all that tends to make a nation great.</p>
<p>Exeter Democrat: The Transmississippi Exposition is the biggest advertisement that has ever been attempted for Nebraska, as well as for the states beyond the Rockies. It is not a visionary, skyrocket scheme, but a well planned and well matured effort to give the widest possible publicity to the advantages offered in this section to capitalists and homeseekers who have money with which to buy land and engage in industrial enterprises.</p>
<p>A moderate estimate places the number of people who will visit the fair at from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000. The lowest amount which these people will spend at the exposition is $10 per capita. That means from $20,000,000 to $30,000,000 passing into Nebraska through the gates of the exposition. But $10 each is a very low estimate. Thousands will remain throughout the fair, each of whom will spend from $2 to $5 a day, and thousands upon thousands will pass through Omaha to the Rockies and the Pacific coast. It is safe to compute that the fair will bring about the circulation of $100,000,000 in the transmississippi country, which will be expended for transportation, in the purchase of supplies and in permanent investments. Thousands of people who visit the exposition will not stop at Omaha, but, having traveled that far, will venture beyond and take in such parts of the country as afford the most attractive field, measured by the exhibits at the fair. Stand up for Nebraska by booming the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
<p>Chappell Register: The Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha next to the Centennial exposition and the World's fair, will be the biggest and most important thing of the kind ever held in the United States, if not in the world. It means a whole lot to Nebraska and the west. Every state west of the Mississippi will be represented, the different states making appropriations for making exhibits and building suitable buildings. Nebraska cannot afford to be behind in the matter, and the present legislature will be asked to appropriate a suitable amount, in keeping with the state and the importance she will gain by being honored with the exposition. The legislature should be liberal in this respect and help make this the greatest exposition ever held. Other states will watch with interest what this state does in this respect, and their part in the fair will be governed by the action of Nebraska. Do the right thing by all means.</p>

<p>Holdrege Citizen: The Transmississippi Exposition project is now under full swing and every loyal Nebraskan should take hold and assist the people of Omaha in their effort to make it a success. Hurrah for the exhibition! If it is a big success, as it ought to be, it will result in being a big blessing for Nebraska. Let every Nebraskan do his part, and then those who live in the other western states will be willing to join in the procession and make the thing hum.</p>
<p>Ashland Gazette: The promoters of the Transmississippi Exposition, to be held in Omaha in the summer of 1898, are at work with commendable energy to make it a success. It is announced that $400,000 of capital stock has already been subscribed, and congress has appropriated $200,000 toward the capitalization of the enterprise. Back of these auspicious beginnings, and more important than the money so far contributed, lies the fact that the exposition is to be a comprehensive exhibit of the natural resources of the most fertile agricultural region in the world, as well as of the inestimable mineral wealth that lies stored away in the deposits of the Rocky mountains. In this region lies an empire of wealth and human progress vaster than any that the world has ever known, and the pre-eminent service that the exposition will render will be set forth in a clearer light the possibilities of this empire, so far existing as it were in embryo. It ought to at once enlist the active co-operation of every citizen of the transmississippi region, and especially of every Nebraskan, and a united effort should be made to make this a fitting climax to the series of interstate exhibits that have in recent years given such a wonderful impetus to the progressive movements in the commercial and industrial world.</p>
<p>Wisner Chronicle: The legislature should not pursue a niggardly, penny-wise-and-pound-foolish policy in dealing with the Transmississippi Exposition appropriation question. It will do more than anything else that can possibly be conceived to place Nebraska and her wonderful progress and still more marvelous possibilities before the world, finally eliminating from the minds of the people the false ideas prevailing concerning the state. It is the opportunity of a century and every effort should be done by the state to make the exposition a revelation to every visitor that will far exceed his most sanguine expectations. It is for the benefit of the entire state to do this, and every dollar judiciously contributed and expended to make the enterprise a success will come back increased many fold.</p>
<p>Alma Record: The Transmississippi Exposition, to be held in Omaha between the 1st day of June and the 1st day of November, 1898, will be the nearest approach to the great World's fair that the people of this country will have an opportunity to see. Very few people realize this important, if not somewhat extraordinary, statement. Twenty states and four territories are embraced in what is known to be the transmississippi region, including every inch of land that lies west of the Mississippi river. This vast territory covers an area upwards of 2,500,000 acres of land and nearly 25,000,000 of people. It is an undeniable fact that the people of this western country possess more "get there" qualities than those of the eastern portion of the United States. What they lack in capital they make up in "push," but the big Omaha show is not going to lack in either of these prime necessities. It must be remembered that the western exhibits at Chicago attracted wider comment than the exhibits of the east, and this being primarily a western exhibit by western people, their efforts will be better directed, guided by the experience of their former attempt. Nebraskans in particular ought to be especially interested, because the Transmississippi Exposition will attract hundreds of thousands of people to this state, who will spend millions of money. This certain fact has been demonstrated by expositions everywhere and does not require argument at this time.</p>
<p>Hickman Republican: The Transmississippi Exposition, which is to be held at Omaha in 1898, promises to be one of the greatest expositions the United States ever had, at least the largest ever held in the west. Every exposition held in the United States has been a benefit to its surrounding country. Millions of dollars will be expended in the erection of buildings. The purchase of products from the farm will give to the producers of the soil an interest in the enterprise, and every citizen of Nebraska should work to the success of the great centennial of 1898.</p>
<p>Edgar Post: The next really great show will be the Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha from June to November, 1898. It will not be confined to exhibits from the transmississippi states, although these of themselves would make a wonderful show, but it will be truly international in character and second only to the great World's fair of 1893.</p>
<p>Neligh Tribune: Omaha will undoubtedly ask the legislature to assist in making the Transmississippi Exposition a success. The Tribune believes the exposition will be of great benefit to the state as well as to Omaha, and, for this reason, will be glad to see our legislators extend to it every reasonable encouragement, and such pecuniary aid, not inconsistent with our financial condition, as the importance of the enterprise warrants.</p>
<p>Superior Daily Journal: And now that the Nebraska legislature is in session, one of the things by which that body can best serve the state in restoring confidence and giving an impetus to the state's growth and consequent prosperity, is to pass without any unnecessary delay a bill making a liberal appropriation for the holding of a Transmississippi and International Exposition at Omaha in 1898. Three hundred thousand dollars is the amount asked for, a sum of money which if judiciously used in connection with the aid granted by the general government and that subscribed by the citizens of Omaha, will bring a hundredfold in returns to the whole state. Nothing the state of Nebraska needs more than a good dose of elixir of life in the way of the present legislature getting a hump on itself in an effort to restore the confidence of the east in this great state, and in no way can they do it better than in a prompt passage of a bill converting the $300,000 asked for this exposition.</p>
<p>Fremont Tribune: Governor Holcomb has done the proper things in recommending a liberal appropriation to the state to help out the Transmississippi Exposition project. We hope the members of the legislature will not regard it as a wise economy to withhold such encouragement to this great enterprise. The governor should, perhaps, have specified how much. People's ideas differ as to what "liberal" means.</p>
<p>Schuyler Sun: In helping the Transmississippi Exposition no one should be more willing and ready to offer material aid than the railroads, and from the attitude taken by them they seem to appreciate the advantages to be derived.</p>
<p>Nehawka Register: The Transmississippi and International Exposition, which is to be held at Omaha from June 1 to November 1, 1898. will afford the states west of the Mississippi an opportunity to make an exhibit of their resources and productive industries. There are twenty states and four territories embraced in this region, and one object of this exposition is to acquaint the people of this and other countries with the wealth and great possibilities of this western country. It cannot help but benefit Nebraska as it will bring within her borders hundreds of thousands of visitors who will expend thousands of dollars for entertainment, to say nothing of the permanent investments that will be made when the possibilities of this great state are set forth by incontrovertible proofs.</p>
<p>Grant Herald-Sentinel: When the legislature gets down to business one of the first things it should do is to make a suitable appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898. Congress has promised a donation of not less than $200,000 for a government exhibit, and private subscriptions to the amount of $400,000 have been subscribed toward pushing the exposition along. Now let Nebraska come forward with a suitable amount and it will be an assured success. The magnitude of the undertaking can scarcely be comprehended, but when the people of Omaha undertake anything they generally make a success of it, and with the assistance of every Nebraskan it will be one of the most wonderful developments of western progress of the time. By all means let us all lend a helping hand and make the exposition a success.</p>
<p>Odell Wave: The effort being made by the managers to make the Transmississippi Exposition a success is receiving the hearty endorsement of the press. This is right, but it should also receive the support of every citizen who takes a pride in the great west and its limitless resources, for the benefits to be derived from it are beyond computation. The state legislature will no doubt set a good example for other states by granting a liberal appropriation.</p>
<p>Coleridge Blade: The government has pledged $200,000 for an exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition to be held in 1893 at Omaha. It now devolved upon the legislature to come forward with an appropriation in order that the transmississippi states may know that we are in earnest in the matter. The appropriation should be liberal and action should be taken early in the session. By so doing we may encourage some of our sister states to more favorably consider the project.</p>
<p>Brewster News: More than $400,000 has been subscribed to the capital stock of the Transmississippi Exposition association and $200,000 pledged by congress for a government exhibit. With this great affair in our own state, Nebraska is under special obligations in making an extraordinary effort to have it a great success and should be first in allowing a liberal appropriation for her own exhibits; the other Transmississippi states will then act likewise in amounts proportionately; the production of a sum sufficient to make the enterprise equal to the best of its kind every held in any country will be an assurance and the year 1898 will be the <choice><sic>greates</sic><corr>greatest</corr></choice> of all years in the history of our state. The News hopes our legislature will take a broad view of the situation and make hay while the sun shines.</p>
<p>O'Neill Sun: The legislature will be asked to make an appropriation of $300,000 for the erection of a suitable buildings and for a display at the Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha from June 1 to November 1 next year. Whether this amount is needed or not, the Sun believes that the legislature will do what is right and that the state's interests will not be allowed to suffer by reason of any meager appropriation.</p>
<p>Arlington Times: Every Nebraska Citizen should do all in his power to help the great exposition along which is to be held in Omaha in 1898. That will be the best way to "stand up for Nebraska." Other states represented will also come in for their share, but to Nebraska additional advantages are lent from the fact that it is to occur within our own borders and that one our own soil visits from the east will stop. It then behooves every citizen of the state to constitute himself a committee of one to work for this great exposition.</p>
<p>Geneva Signal: One question of considerable importance that will confront the legislature now in session is, How much aid will it give the Transmississippi Exposition, to be held in Omaha next year?</p>
<p>While fully realizing that the people of Nebraska are not in a financial condition to warrant lavish expenditures for any object that might be classed as a luxury, the Signal believes that the sound business judgment of the people will approve of an appropriation of about $250,000 in aid of this exposition, and that quite on the ground of its being a good investment.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be a luxury for Chicago to have another exposition at this time, but the transmississippi country is subject to different conditions.</p>
<p>Nothing like the proposed exposition has ever been attempted in this region. It is a source of advantage that has never been used. The west had practically determined some time ago to have such an exposition at some central point. Omaha was the successful competitor, being almost without opposition. The exposition would have gone to some other town in the west if not to Omaha.</p>
<p>Now that we have the exposition, what are we going to do with it? Shall we take every proper step to get the greatest measure of value out of it, or shall we save at the spigot to lose at the bunghole by failing to appropriate a reasonable sum for making certain the success of the exposition and its benefit to the state of Nebraska.</p>
<p>Nebraska wants more people and more money, and a growth at our time of life as a state means the bringing in of more money. The exposition will familiarize thousands of people with Nebraska's products, resources, topography and climate who would perhaps otherwise never know much about the state. We believe it will be profitable to all of us for these people to make this acquaintance.</p>
<p>The members of the legislature represent the people, and it now lies with them to say what shall be done for the exposition.</p>
<p>Niobrara Tribune: One of the first things done by the Nebraska state legislature should be the passage of a bill in aid of the Transmississippi Exposition. The exposition will be a great benefit to Nebraska and the west and Nebraska should set a good, healthy pace for her western neighbors.</p>
<p>Sidney Telegraph: Active preparations for the great Transmississippi Exposition, to be held in Omaha from June 1 to November 1, 1898, have now begun. Uncle Sam is taking a most lively interest in everything pertaining to the exposition and will lose no opportunity to render it all the aid he possibly can. Subscriptions are pouring in from all sides and they now reach nearly $500,000. The state legislature will be asked to make a liberal appropriation for the exposition, and it certainly cannot refuse to grant the request. The enterprising citizens of Omaha have undertaken a big contract, but they can be depended upon to fulfill it with honor to themselves and credit to the state at large.</p>
<p>Valley Enterprise: The Transmississippi Exposition is now enjoying quite a boom, not only in Omaha, but in Nebraska and all over the transmississippi region. Let her boom. It will be a great thing for our whole state.</p>
<p>Hartington Herald: About $250,000 or $300,000 would be the proper recognition for the Transmississippi Exposition. All Nebraska would say amen to a liberal appropriation for this enterprise.</p>
<p>Kennard Enterprise: The managers of the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha are getting down to business. This is one of the grandest undertakings that has ever been inaugurated in the west, and every state if interested, more especially the people of Nebraska, should do their utmost to make this exposition a grand success and an event that will forever stand in the annals of history.</p>
<p>Elsie Leader: The exposition at Omaha in 1898 will be a great advertisement for Nebraska, and every man in the state should do everything in his power to assist in marking it a success.</p>
<p>Wayne Herald: The great Transmississippi Exposition, to be held in Omaha in 1898, in attracting widespread attention throughout not only the United States but foreign countries. The government will appropriate $300,000 for a government exhibit, and every state of the Mississippi valley will make an exhibit which will no doubt equal, if not excel, the exhibits at the World's Fair. It behooves every Nebraskan to take an interest in the Exposition, for it means everything to Nebraska. The great resources of the state will be made known to the world and it will bring capital to the state, resulting in the building of such industries as will bring prosperity to the state, Wayne county should begin to prepare for it. Procrastination never brings good results.</p>

<p>Shelton Clipper: The management of Omaha's Transmississippi Exposition announces that private subscriptions to capital stock have already been received to the amount of $400,000. Congress has pledged $200,000 for a government exhibit, and now if the legislature will make a liberal appropriation the success of the exposition is assured. This will be, no doubt, the greatest advertisement Nebraska ever had and will bring the resources of the state prominently before the world. It behooves every citizen of the state to do everything in his power to assist in making the exposition a success. It's a good thing; push it along.</p>
<p>Shickley Herald: A liberal appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition at the hands of the Nebraska legislature will be the right thing. Every true hearted citizen of the state is bound to feel real interest in the exposition and will say amen to anything that goes to help it. This grand state of ours has a chance to show the people of the east, the west, the north and the south that she is wide awake and thrifty and that business activity is always with us. And the way is open through this exposition. Each and all of us can some little good talking for it.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">CHICAGO EXPERTS LOOK OVER THE LAND</head>
<head type="sub">Engineers Employed to Advise the Local Committee Arrange for an Inspection of the Probable Locations.</head>
<p>H. C. Alexander and A. C. Schrader, the Chicago engineers employed by the special committee of the Board of Directors of the Transmississippi Exposition association to inspect the five sites proposed as locations for the exposition, arrived in Omaha this morning. After engaging rooms at the Paxton the experts went at once to the office of C. E. Yost, chairman of the special committee. Here they met Messrs. Yost and Wilcox, the third member of the committee, J. H. Millard, being out of the city.</p>
<p>After a short conference it was decided that the most expeditious plan of examining the sites would be for each site to be shown to the experts by its friends without the intervention of any member of the special committee or of any adverse interest, after which the engineers might make such investigations as they wished. In accordance with this arrangement, Mr. Yost telephoned the advocates of each of the sites and asked them to come at once to his office. In a short time Lee Estelle, representing Miller park site; D. H. Christie, representing Miller park; City Attorney Connell, representing the Hanscom park site, and W. R. Bennett and George W. Kelley, representing Elmwood park site, were on hand. After consultation it was decided that Miller park should be visited this morning, Hanscom park this afternoon, Riverview park tomorrow morning and Elmwood park tomorrow afternoon. The representatives of East Omaha were not present, but it was informally decided that the site lying between Cut-Off and Florence lakes should be visited Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Councilman Christie quickly secured a carriage, and, accomplished by R. W. Richardson, another ardent advocate of the advantages offered by Miller park, the start was made for the north side park. The party returned to the Paxton in time for the engineers to take the edge off an appetite whetted by the short outing, after which they were taken in hand by City Attorney Connell and driven out to Hanscom park.</p>
<p>In response to questions the experts said that in making their reports to the committee and Board of Directors they would include all matters which, in their judgement, had any bearing upon the desirability of the several sites for exposition purposes. To do this they said they should consult with the city engineer regarding the grades, sewer and water facilities and other engineering data necessary to be taken into consideration and should also make such examination of all the surrounding conditions as would enable them to make an intelligent and comprehensive report.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">EARLY ACTION IS IMPORTANT.</head>
<head type="sub">Real Estate Men Urge the Necessity of Expedition.</head>
<p>The exposition was the principal subject of discussion at the meeting of the Real Estate exchange this afternoon. As a result the following resolution, offered by W. B. Taylor, was unanimously adopted:</p>
<p>"Resolved, That it is the sense of the exchange that it is of the greatest importance that the Nebraska legislature now in session should immediately proceed with the consideration of the bill now pending making an appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition, and that the said bill should be favorably considered without unnecessary delay. In view of the fact that the legislatures of other states are now in session and that they will be largely governed by the action of the Nebraska legislature on this very important measure, it should receive immediate consideration and prompt, final and favorable action on the part of our legislature."</p>
<p>In support of the resolution Mr. Taylor called attention to the fact that unless the Nebraska bill was passed before February 1 there would be only two or three weeks left in which to secure appropriations from the legislatures of the other western states. Naturally other states could not be expected to act until Nebraska had done its part. A committee expected to go to Springfield next week to urge the passage of the bill now before the Illinois legislature, and the first question asked would be how much the Nebraska legislature had appropriated. The legislatures of nearly all the western states were limited in time and it was imperative that action should be taken as early as possible. The Nebraska bill, Mr. Taylor said, should be passed at the earliest possible date in order that the committees might go before the legislatures of other states and secure adequate appropriations. The resolution was discussed along this line and passed. There will be another meeting of the exchange tomorrow to make arrangements for following up the resolution.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">WOMAN'S WORK IN THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">Woman's Club Appoints a Committee of Nine to Prepare Plans.</head>
<p>The Woman's club took action yesterday afternoon upon the request of the executive committee of the exposition, asking the club to appoint a committee to formulate a plan for a woman's department of the exposition. A committee of nine members of the club was elected to formulate such a plan and submit it to the exposition executive committee for its approval.</p>
<p>The meeting of the club was held in the Creighton theater, and was attended by about 250 women. After the preliminary business of the meeting had been disposed of, the special order of the session was taken up, and Mrs. F. F. Ford moved the appointment of a committee to name a committee or five to prepare such a plan as had been requested.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sudborough moved to amend by making the committee consist of nine members, in order to give it a wider scope. The amendment was discussed by several of the members, and was then adopted.</p>
<p>President Harford suggested that the nominating committee should report eighteen names to be balloted for instead of selecting nine names, thus limiting the choice of the club. This suggestion was incorporated into the motion, which was then carried unanimously.</p>
<p>The chair appointed the following nominating committee: Mesdames W. W. Keysor, W. H. Wyman and E. B. Toll of South Omaha.</p>
<p>While the committee was preparing its report, the club took up the proposed amendments to the constitution, which had been laid over under the rules. The amendment changing the meeting days from Monday to Saturday was defeated by an overwhelming majority. The amendment providing for a library committee of five members, to have charge of a reference library to be established by the gradual purchase of desirable books, was carried without opposition.</p>
<p>The nominating committee presented its report, recommending the following eighteen women to be voted for in the election of a committee of nine: Mesdames Z. T. Lindsey, A. S. Stiger, T. K. Sudborough, Frank Heller, I. R. Andrews, W. S. Strawn, A. N. Ferguson, J. H. Dumont, S. R. Towne, C. E. Yost, C. W. Damon, John A. MacMurphy, Henry James, B. M. Webster, John Gordon, F. Broadwell, C. E. Squires and Miss S. J. Barrows.</p>
<p>Mrs. Broadwell declined to stand for election, and Mrs. F. F. Ford nominated the president, Mrs. Harford, to fill the vacancy thus occasioned. This motion carried unanimously and the balloting commenced.</p>
<p>The home committee was appointed to act as tellers, as the ballots were collected by the members of the committee, who then retired to the waiting room to count the vote.</p>
<p>The meeting was then turned over to Mrs. T. K. Sudborough, chairman of the educational department, who introduced Superintendent C. G. Pearse of the public schools, who talked for about twenty minutes upon the general condition of the public schools from a financial standpoint.</p>
<p>The counting of the ballots occupied some time, and the exercises of the meeting were prolonged in order to fill in the time. When the report was finally made it showed that the following women had been elected as the committee to formulate a plan for a woman's department: Mesdames Z. T. Lindsay, A. S. Stiger, T. K. Sudborough, F. Heller, I. R. Andrews, A. N. Ferguson, S. R. Towne and C. E. Squires.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><p>The ostensible object of sending for non-resident engineers and landscape gardeners instead of choosing those equally competent at home was to avoid even the appearance of local bias in the selection of an exposition site. TO be sure, only one location can be chosen. But that one should be chosen strictly in the interest of a successful exposition and not to boom the real estate of any individual or set of individuals.</p>
<p>The resolution passed by the Real Estate exchange urging the necessity of all possible speed in the passing by the legislature of the Transmississippi appropriation bill is an expression of the desire of the whole people and should not be neglected by those most nearly concerned.</p>
<p>The chorus of promised loyalty and assistance to the Transmississippi Exposition continues to go up from the Nebraska press and is including in ever-widening circles the newspapers of adjoining states and the great journals of the east.</p>
<p>The women are going into the work of preparing their department of the exposition with a zeal and enthusiasm which insures success and which cannot be surpassed even by the activity of the men who have the main enterprise in hand.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">SOUTH SIDE IMPROVEMENT CLUB.</head>
<head type="sub">Committee Appointed to Escort Chicago Experts to Riverview Park.</head>
<p>The South Side Improvement club held its regular session at Tenth and Hickory streets last night, and the location of the Transmississippi Exposition was the main topic under discussion. John Powers acted as chairman, with F. K. Darling secretary.</p>
<p>Mr. Darling, as chairman of the committee appointed to confer with a committee of South Omaha men on the location of the exposition, made a report. He said the South Omaha contingent expressed themselves as being in favor of the Riverview park site and pledged their support in raising funds for the grading of the grounds, or for any other purpose which, as the plans matured, might be deemed necessary. The South Omaha men stated they would be present at last night's meeting of the club, but later sent word that it would be impossible to attend until the next meeting night.</p>
<p>Ernest Stuht was of the opinion that the south side should have the exposition located in its favorite park. He thought if all the property owners of the First and Second wards and those interested in the project in South Omaha would contribute fifty cents each, that $25,000 might easily be raised in improving the park for exposition purposes.</p>
<p>A committee composed of Ernest Stuht, W. W. Bingham, F. J. Kaspar, Frank Darling, Judge Gordon, John Powers and Dr. Hanchett was delegated to meet at the Paxton at 8 o'clock this morning and accompany the Chicago engineering experts, who intend to look over the Riverview park site today with a view to its selection for exposition purposes.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">ENDORSE THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>Adams Globe: Governor Holcomb in his message recommended a liberal appropriation to the Transmississippi Exposition. Other states cannot be expected to give a vigorous support to an enterprise within our own state unless our state stands behind the enterprise in a substantial manner and the state legislature grants a liberal appropriation, as suggested by the governor. The Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898 is an enterprise that is being prosecuted with energy and promises to be a grand success and a great thing for Nebraska as well as the other transmississippi states. Four hundred thousand dollars has already been subscribed to the enterprise and congress has pledged $200,000 for a government exhibit. If the enterprise meets the expectation of its managers it will be a great advertisement for this western country and no doubt bring money and enterprise west that would not otherwise come. It will furnish eastern people a great opportunity to see the west and learn of its great possibilities.</p>
<p>Boyd County Register: The Transmississippi Exposition is now an assured fact. The amount subscribed to its capital stock is over $400,000, while congress gives $200,000 for the government exhibit. Other states have pledged generous amounts to the enterprise and no doubt the larger number of the states of the union will be represented at the great display of 1898. This exposition will be an incalculable benefit to Nebraska. While the newspaper would indeed be false to the interest of the state and that of its town did it not use its influence and its every energy to promote the success of this display of American skill and enterprise, in doing this it is but right that we urge upon our representatives in the legislature, now at Lincoln, to appropriate $200,000 at least, in order to make the undertaking a brilliant success and a pride to every citizen of Nebraska.</p>

<p>Valentine Republican Regarding the Transmississippi Exposition which is to be held at Omaha in 1898, it should be the aim of all sections to give the project impartial and undivided support, laying aside all prejudice in the matter. The exposition will redound to the benefit of Omaha and the state of Nebraska, as a matter of fact, from its location, but that will not distract from the manifold benefits that it will bring to the entire transmississippi region and for this reason there should be concert of action in making the exposition a pronounced success and a benefit to the large area it is contemplated to cover. Each state should be interested and vie with the other in carrying on this magnificent undertaking to a glorious triumph.</p>    
<p>Bancroft Blade: Governor Holcomb in his message to the legislature advised a liberal appropriation for the benefit of the Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898. It is hoped that the legislature of Nebraska will not fail to realize the necessity of this appropriation. Nebraska was very fortunate in securing the location of the exposition on its soil, and now that that point is settled every Nebraskan who desires to demonstrate to the world the true merits of our state should use every effort to make this enterprise a success.</p>    
<p>Genoa Leader: Governor Holcomb recommends that the legislature make a liberal appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition. This will meet the approval of every fair-minded man in Nebraska. The exposition is destined to be a great thing for our state and no policy of false economy should stand in the way of giving it every possible assistance, individual or state.</p>
<p>Osceola Record: The Transmississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898 is now being pushed by its promoters. The people of Omaha have made a careful, thorough organization to see that nothing is left undone which can possibly promote the interests of the big show, and we hope to see the howling success, which almost everything is which is backed by the "wild west." Every true Nebraskan will grab hold and push some.</p>
<p>Creighton Courier: The legislature should make a liberal appropriation of the Transmississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898. This exposition will do more to turn the <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> westward than anything, and if done <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> in royal style will be the best advertisement Nebraska ever had.</p>
<p>Wisner Chronicle: Governor Holcomb in his message directed the attention of the legislature to the history of the Transmississippi Exposition movement, and urged a liberal policy toward it by the state. The legislature will certainly rise to the full measure of its duty in the encouragement of the exposition.</p>
<p>Norfolk Journal: A bill has been introduced in the legislature providing an appropriation of $350,000 for a Nebraska exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha next year. Whether or not the amount asked is too large, the Journal is not prepared to say. Nebraska should have an exhibit and a building in which the people of the state can take a rare degree of pride, and while the amount of money set aside for that purpose should not be extravagant, neither should it be niggardly. The thousands of visitors who will come to Omaha should be given an opportunity to see the vast resources of the state, and should have those resources placed before them in the most attractive and impressive manner. The experience of the state at Chicago is a warning against parsimony as well as against incompetence in the management of the state display, and the legislature should appropriate sufficient funds to not only secure the best possible exhibit, but the services of the right man to handle it.</p>
<p>Superior Journal: And now that the Nebraska legislature is in session, one of the things by which that body can best serve the state in restoring confidence and giving an impetus to the state's growth and consequent prosperity, is to pass without any unnecessary delay a bill making a liberal appropriation for the holding of the Transmississippi and International Exposition at Omaha in 1898. Three hundred thousand dollars is the amount asked for, a sum of money which, if judiciously used in connection with the aid granted by the general government and that subscribed by the citizens of Omaha, will bring a hundredfold in returns to the whole state. Nothing the state of Nebraska needs more than a good dose of elixir of life in the way of the present legislature getting a hump on itself in an effort to restore the confidence of the east in this great state, and in no way can they do it better than in a prompt passage of a bill conveying the $300,000 asked for this exposition. This we say, of course, with the understanding that Cracker-box Joe Garneau's are to have any finger in the running of this great show, as was the case at Chicago.</p>
<p>Schuyler Sun: The Transmississippi Exposition is bound to be a success as it should be. Governor Holcomb, in his message referred to it in a most favorable manner. Already $400,000 of the stock has been paid in. Congress has appropriated $200,000 which is confidently expected will be increased to $500,000.

<head type="sub">GAINS STRENGTH WITH THE LEGISLATORS</head>
<head type="sub">Public Presentation of the Matter and the Objections to the Appropriation Encourage Friends of the Enterprise.</head>
    <div3>
<p>LINCOLN, Jan. 20.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Friends of the Transmississippi and International Exposition feel much encouraged over the result of the first public presentation of the claims of that enterprise upon the people of the state. At the joint convention of the two houses last night the opposition to the enterprise was voiced by Representative Charles Wooster of Merrick county. He had been selected, according to his own admission, to give expression to the sentiment which, he asserted, existed against the proposition to make an appropriation from the state treasury to assist in the undertaking. Summed up, the opposition may be stated as follows:</p>
<p>1. The exposition is to be purely a local affair, from which Omaha alone will reap the benefits.</p>
<p>2. The people of Nebraska are opposed to the idea of the exposition.</p>
<p>3. The exposition would be a damage to the state rather than a benefit, because the people would exhaust their available money in paying their expenses in visiting it.</p>
<p>4. The exposition would be a bad advertisement for Nebraska, for it would show to the people of the east a disposition to waste money for a useless show instead of using it to pay state debts with.</p>
<p>5. The farmers of Nebraska do not want to sell their farms.</p>
<p>6. Because the state treasury is empty, taxes are too high and property depreciating in value.</p>
<p>7. Because all of the directors of the exposition are Omaha men.</p>
<p>8. Because the directors refused to adopt a resolution demanded by the laboring men.</p>
<p>9. Because it was a scheme gotten up for the benefit of Omaha bankers.</p>
<p>These are the objections urged against the bill and against the opposition. It is within the truth to say that the friends of the exposition feel more confident of success after the full force of the opposition has been felt. Every objection was answered in so convincing a manner that every point was vigorously applauded. If Mr. Wooster's remarks revealed the opposition to the bill, the marked demonstration of approval with which the legislators received the answers to the objection revealed a stronger sentiment in favor of the enterprise.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">ARGUMENTS FOR THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>Hon. G. W. Wattles of Omaha, president of the Transmississippi and International Exposition company, was the first speaker to address the assemblage. He reviewed in detail the history of the exposition from its very inception at the meeting of the Transmississippi Congress at St. Louis down to the present time; laying especial stress upon the fact that the exposition was not a local enterprise, but one undertaken by the states and territories west of the Mississippi river. He closed his arguments by expressing his belief that the temporary benefits that would accrue to Nebraska from the exposition would be the least of the advantages to be secured by the state by the incursion of new people, new enterprises, new capital and new blood.</p>
<p>G. M. Hitchcock, chief of the Bureau of Promotion, was next introduced, and he announced that he would divide his time with Charles Wooster, representative from Merrick county, and that he would reply to that gentleman's arguments. Mr. Hitchcock asserted that Omaha has done its part and now asked the state to do its share. He asserted that there would be no lobby at Lincoln to work for the passage of the bill making a state appropriation for the exposition.</p>
<p>He also said that the exposition depended upon the action of the legislature. If the pending bill was passed the men at the head of the enterprise would push forward. If the appropriation was not made, the exposition project was dead. He closed the first part of his argument by saying that if it was wise to have an exposition, it was the part of wisdom to have a great one. He believed that the time had come for the west to arouse itself and attract the tide of immigration and investment to the west. "We cannot," he said, "carry Nebraska around and exhibit her to the people of the east, but we can bring millions of the people from the east to Nebraska by means of the exposition."</p>
<p>Representative Charles Wooster then spoke in opposition to the exposition. He asserted that the exposition was solely for the benefit of Omaha; that it would do Nebraska more harm than good, and that the people of the state were opposed to the whole scheme. The joint convention seemed to enjoy his remarks as an entertainment, for the points he made elicited frequent bursts of hearty laughter.</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchcock replied to the objections urged by Mr. Wooster and his replies brought out round after round of vigorous applause. The joint convention was then adjourned at 9:35 o'clock, in pursuance of the rule adopted by the committee on ways and means.</p>
<p>A number of selfish interests have already taken advantage of the situation to advance themselves at the expense of the exposition. Men with private bills to push are already using their influence to advance them by threats to hold off the exposition bill unless their own pet measures are guaranteed the support of the friends of the exposition. The friends of the enterprise, and the members of the Douglas county delegation especially, are very properly holding aloof from selfish considerations and are working with a single purpose in view, and that purpose is to secure the passage of the exposition bill. In the judgment of the friends of the enterprise the chances of success were improved by last night's meeting, and the undertaking is winning friends every hour.</p></div3></div2>

<head type="sub">EXPOSITION OFFICERS KEEP OPEN HOUSE</head>
<head type="sub">Managers of the Several Departments Installed in the New Rooms on the Sixth Floor of the Paxton Block.</head>
<p>Headquarters of the Transmississippi and International Exposition are now located in the Paxton block, the rooms on the sixth floor of that block having been formally taken possession of this morning. The rooms now occupied are confined to the west wing of the block with the exception of the president's room and that to be occupied by the Department of Transportation, both of which are in the center of the building, facing Farnam street.</p>
<p>Stepping from the elevator and turning sharply to the right the visitor finds himself at the entrance to the suite of three rooms occupied jointly by the Departments of Exhibits and Concessions. These consist of a main office and two smaller rooms opening from it, which are used as the private offices of the two departments. The hall leading to the front of the west wing is closed by a door. Passing through this, the two rooms occupied by the Department of Promotion are next, south of those occupied by Exhibits and Concessions. Next to these is the office of Manager Lindsey of the Department of Ways and Means. Secretary Wakefield occupies the room next to Manager Lindsey, being the corner room, fronting both Farnam and Sixteenth streets. The clerical force of the Ways and Means department occupies two rooms fronting on Farnam street and one room immediately in the rear facing the east. Next on the north of this comes the room of the storekeeper, and the large room north of this is to be used as a meeting room for the directors. This includes all the rooms in the west wing on this floor and the office of President Wattles is in the center of the building. This office consists of a small waiting room and the main office, a pleasant room facing Farnam street. A similar suite a little further east has been selected by Manager Babcock for the Department of Transportation. Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds has not selected his offices, as the work of his department will not commence until after the site has been selected. The Department of Publicity will remain in The Bee building.</p>
<p>All of the offices heretofore have been handsomely papered and the woodwork repainted, and such alterations made in the rooms as were desired by the occupants. Some of the new furniture was placed in position this morning and additions will be made from time to time. The rooms occupied by the president are the only ones in the entire lot which are carpeted. A local furniture firm donated a carpet for the floor of the main room, linoleum for the other room and tables, chairs, a couch and other suitable furniture for the suite. Up to date no other firm has followed this example.</p>
<p>St. Paul Press: The Transmississippi Exposition, which is to be held in Omaha in 1898 is receiving considerable attention from the press and people of the western states. Over $400,000 has already been secured by the association, and congress has pledged $200,000 more, which begins to look as though there would be no lack of funds to assure the exposition a grand success. This spirit of western enterprise should receive all the encouragement possible, as it will be on instance where the people will not be compelled to go east to spend their money, which has heretofore been the case and constantly drained the west of its available cash. The general feeling is one of great interest in the coming exposition, and we are pleased to see that sort of disposition manifest among the people of the west, and especially those of Nebraska. Later on we shall make our readers more familiar with the objects and features of the exposition.</p>
<p>Valparaiso Visitor: Our legislature should make ample appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition to be held in 1898. This will be one of the best advertisements the state ever had, and will bring thousands of people to our state.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">READY TO PREPARE THEIR REPORT</head>
<head type="sub">Engineers Conclude the Work of Viewing Exposition Sites.</head>
<p>The viewing of the proposed exposition sites by the Chicago engineers employed to report upon the advantages and disadvantages of each was completed this morning. Accompanied by John Daugherty the engineers drove to the locality which has been designed the "East Omaha site," and inspected the land lying between Cutoff and Florence lakes which has been offered for a site. The points of vantage were pointed out by Mr. Daugherty and the surroundings were carefully examined by the experts. The party returned to the city about noon and the time before Saturday afternoon will be spent by the engineers in preparing their report to the directors, which will be presented at the meeting Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning the engineers were taken in charge at 8:30 o'clock by the committee appointed by the South Side Improvement club and were shown the beauties of Riverview park. The committee comprised F. K. Darling, John Powers, E. Stuht, F. J. Kaspar, Lee Estelle and Dr. W. H. Hanchett. Four carriages were required to convey the party to the park. They proceeded by way of the boulevard entrance on Sixth street and entered the park at the north end. The party alighted and walked over the entire grounds which it is proposed to utilize as a site. The escort took good care that none of the arguments in favor of their site were overlooked, and they explained very fully just how they thought the grounds should be laid out. It was stated by some of the party that the South Side club would do whatever grading might be necessary to put the grounds in the required condition to commence building operations.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the experts were shown the Elmwood park site by W. R. Bennett. The party examined the advantages offered by the park and the adjacent fair grounds, the railroad facilities and other means of reaching the spot, the general character of the buildings already constructed on the fair grounds and all other points of advantage that its advocates claim for this site.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">LOCATING THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>OMAHA, Jan. 20.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: The proper place for the exposition is where the most people can reach it with the least possible exertion and expense. That place would be on the corner of Sixteenth and Farnam, but as that cannot be done, the nearer one can get to that point the better it would be. Therefore I should recommend the Hanscom park site as most available. It is nearer to Council Bluffs and to South Omaha than any of the other sites mentioned. Half of Omaha can get to it without depending on any mode of transportation other than that which nature has provided, leaving the transit lines for the use of strangers and distant residents.</p>
<p>Omaha has made several grievous mistakes in locating public institutions. One is the State fair. I will venture to say that if you ask 5,000 residents of Omaha why they did not attend the State fair last fall they will say it was too far and that it was too hard to get there. And those who did go did not go but once, especially if the first trip was by the electric line. Three-fourths of our citizens, for this reason, have never seen our new fort, notwithstanding its beautiful buildings and charming band.</p>
<p>The fort was located in Sarpy county and the state fair grounds near Elkhorn. Now place the exposition near Florence, build up solid between these points, and have a city of magnificent distances.</p>
<p>Why cannot this city sell, trade or give away some of the outside farms commonly called parks, get a piece of land near the city&#8212;land is not nearly so valuable as we thought it a few years ago&#8212;and place the exposition in it. After that the state fair and race track. One well located, properly kept, central park would be cheaper and be worth more to our city than six scattered and neglected ones. Have a place that all can reach. Five or 10 cents is not much to some people, but to a great many it is a good deal, and often more than they can afford to pay for recreation or pleasure. Surely these people are entitled to some consideration. Therefore let us have an accessible central location.</p>

<div2 type="article"><dateline>OMAHA, TUESDAY EVENING, <lb/> JANUARY 19, 1897.</dateline>
    <head type="sub">ENDORSE THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>Pawnee Republican: The managers of the Transmississippi Exposition will apply to the legislature this winter for an appropriation in aid of the exposition. We believe the members of the legislature will have sufficient state pride in the immense benefit that will accrue to the state as an advertising medium to vote an appropriation that will reflect the sentiment of the progressive element of our population. We should not be niggardly in furthering an enterprise that will fetch us in return wealth and immigration immeasurable.</p>
<p>Blair Courier: The Transmississippi Exposition managers are active, and if they don't turn out a good exposition it won't be their fault. But the entire west has some work to do if it be a complete success. Let the Nebraska legislature that is now convened do its duty to the exposition state and then in 1898 each member can feel his bosom swell with pride as he beholds the eighth wonder of the world.</p>
<p>Blair Pilot: Those who have followed more closely the result of fairs and expositions are best prepared to realize the vast amount of good that will accrue to Nebraska first and the entire west second as a result of the Transmississippi Exposition. A conservative estimate places the number of people who will visit this exposition at from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000. These must be fed and sheltered. The food will come first from Nebraska farms and the help to build the exposition buildings will be furnished by Nebraska to a large extent. Millions of dollars will be spent and thousands of men given profitable employment. The World's fair increased the population of Chicago over 500,000 and increased the property value by nearly $200,000,000. A like result was felt in Philadelphia as a result of the Centennial exposition in 1876. New Orleans experienced a similar result in 1884. Every city that has been favored by the location of some exposition within its boundary testifies to the great good derived from that source. Not only should Omaha put forth her best efforts in behalf of the exposition so soon to be opened in her midst, but every patriotic Nebraskan should put forth united effort in promoting the enterprise. There are none so poor as to be able to escape some good in the way of an increase in property values, even though your property be a muscular arm.</p>
<p>Columbus Journal: The Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha in 1898 must not be lost sight of by Nebraskans.</p>
<p>From June to November, next year, we are to be less than 100 miles (a three hours' ride on the cars) from one of the greatest gatherings of modern civilization&#8212;an exhibit of the world's progress up to date; a little World's fair in Nebraska; a season of reunion for old friends; a rendezvous for people widely separated both by time and space&#8212;"meet me in Omaha in June, 1898;" an object school for the young folks who wish to get in a glimpse a view of the present age of wonderful achievement and more wonderful invention; an object school for the aged who wish to have some hint of an answer to the ever-recurring question, What next?</p>
<p>The general government's pledge of not less than $200,000 and the subscription of $400,000 besides is enough to indicate what the exhibit may mean for Nebraska if the proper steps are taken. The recommendation of Governor Holcomb is timely, when he says to the legislature: "I trust that the financial assistance given by you will be liberal and sufficient, so that our sister states and territories west of the Mississippi may be thereby encouraged to lend their substantial aid." Of course a meager, lean and cadaverous "recognition" by the legislature would be an ugly thing for them to do and is not to be thought of. Iowa has already made a considerable appropriation and promises more, while other states and territories will doubtless gauge their appropriations by what Nebraska does.</p>
<p>Omaha is not half way across the continent, and this, the first great exhibit for the western portion of our country, ought to receive ample appreciation every way from Nebraskans. It will tend to educate United States people to the facts of the abounding natural resources of these plains and mountains; the unexampled pace of settlement and the progress made long industrial, commercial and aesthetic lines. This education will result in benefit to this country more than ample to repay ten times the expenditure.</p>
<p>Wayne Herald: The great Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898 is attracting widespread attention throughout not only the United States but foreign countries. The government will appropriate $300,000 for a government exhibit and every state of the Mississippi valley will make an exhibit which will no doubt equal, if not excel, the exhibits at the World's fair. It behooves every Nebraskan to take an interest in the exposition, for it means everything to Nebraska. The great resources of the state will be made known to the world and it will bring capital to the state, resulting in the building of such industries as will bring prosperity to the state. Wayne county should begin to prepare for it. Procrastination never brings good results.</p>
<p>Aurora Republican: Let us all put a shoulder to the wheel and push the coming exposition so as to make it second only to the great World's fair of 1893. We hope that the legislature will make a liberal appropriation to the enterprise, as it will be a grand thing for our state, and as far as this paper is concerned, the Department of Publicity will find us ever ready and willing to help make it a grand affair.</p>
<p>Polk County Democrat: The governor leaves no uncertain tone in his message with regard to what he thinks of the Transmississippi Exposition, to be held at Omaha next year. We believe the governor is right and that Nebraska cannot afford to refuse a good appropriation for the great undertaking. Already other states are appropriating large sums with which to make a display of their resources. Certainly it would be a very poor policy to hold a great national gathering of the kind contemplated on Nebraska soil and have the state government refuse an appropriation. The exposition will be held, that part is a settled fact. Will the state derive all the benefit possible? This is an important question for the present legislature to decide.</p>
<p>Bloomfield Monitor: The officers of the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha are actively engaged in their work. This exposition will be a great thing for the state in general and Omaha in particular. Every Nebraskan, no matter who he may be, should do something to encourage the officers and help make this exposition one of the grandest the world has ever seen. The state legislature should not forget that they have also a duty to perform. Other states expect Nebraska to come to the front with a very liberal appropriation, and if it is not done they will put no confidence in it. Nebraska must do her part and do it well.</p>
<p>Norfolk News: The directors of the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha seem to be on the verge of making a very serious mistake. At a meeting of the committee held on Saturday a resolution was introduced providing that in the awarding of contracts for labor it shall be stipulated.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">EXPERT ENGINEERS VIEW THE GROUNDS</head>
<head type="sub">Advantages of the Several Proposed Locations Are Explained by Their Enthusiastic Advocates&#8212;Work is Progressing Rapidly.</head>
<p>The engineers from Chicago who were employed to investigate the several sites offered for the location of the Transmississippi Exposition are having a busy time of it. Yesterday morning they started for Miller park at 10:30 o'clock under the guidance of D. H. Christie and R. W. Richardson. They drove to the boulevard entrance on Twenty-fourth street and then alighted from the carriage and walked over the entire grounds offered as a site. They surveyed the general situation, examined the character of the soil and visited old Fort Omaha, where they examined the grounds of the abandoned fort, and then drove to Florence, where they visited the plant of the Omaha Water company. The party remained in and about the water plant for about an hour, the visitors evincing great interest in all the details of the monster machinery. At 3:30 o'clock the party returned to the city and the engineers ate a hurried lunch before proceeding to the Hanscom park site.</p>
<p>Mr. Christie, who has been an enthusiastic supporter of the Miller park site, said this morning that he felt very confident since the exploring expedition with the engineers. He said the experts had been shown everything he could think of that had anything to do with the use of the proposed site, including the ditch which it is proposed to convert into a sewer, the railroad facilities and the water supply. In the latter connection Mr. Christie said that the engineer of the water works, Captain Reynolds, had told the engineering experts that his company would not undertake to supply water for lakes or in great quantities to any other site than Miller park, explaining that the large main in Thirtieth street, which is separate from the main system and which was formerly used to supply the old fort, would be used to supply water for the lakes and other purposes in Miller park, but that it would be necessary to increase the present water pressure in order to do this, and that the company could not undertake to lay an extra main to exposition grounds in any other location. Mr. Christie also stated that the engineers, while they were especially careful not to express any opinion regarding the site for exposition purposes, said they wished they had such beautifully rolling land in Chicago, as they could then make beautiful parks without excessive expense. They also laid particular stress upon the desirability of having some of the buildings of the exposition located upon public<note>article ends abruptly</note></p></div2>

        <p>Bayard Transcript: The Nebraska legislature will have an opportunity to do a good thing for the state when it makes a suitable appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition for 1898. Private subscriptions for the enterprise to the amount of $400,000 have been already secured, and the general government has promised $200,000 for the exhibit. The legislature should make an appropriation liberal in its magnitude. If we hope to secure the co-operation of the transmississippi states Nebraska should set an example worthy of her people. Stand up for Nebraska.</p>
<p>Lincoln New Republic: Editor Rosewater of The Omaha Bee is in charge of the department of publicity of the Transmississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha, June to November, 1898. H is the right man in the right place. The achievement of a quarter of a century, in which he has <choice><sic>builded</sic><corr>built</corr></choice> a lasting monument to his fame as an editor, a manager and a generally successful business man, by bringing The Bee to the forefront as a newspaper and the housing of it in one of the best equipped buildings in the country, is a sure sign that he will spread near and far the grand purpose of this immense undertaking, wherein twenty-two states and territories will mass the wealth gathered and garnered from 2,687,605 square miles of territory, and in which there will be a contemplated expenditure by the government and by the states of $2,000,000. The New Republic will lend a helping hand and will do all it can to shut out from that grand western aggregation of thrift, pluck and enterprise all sales of alcoholic beverages. Liquor has never added 1 cent to the wealth of the country, then why recognize this great waste?</p>
<p>Woman's Weekly: The Transmississippi Exposition is bound to receive favorable treatment at the hands of our legislature this winter. No man who pretends to have any interest in his fellow man or in the state can afford to oppose a thing so helpful and so far-reaching as this. It is getting into shape at the Omaha end of the line and all are glad that things are so peaceful on the surface, however much they may be seething on the inside. Winter is a good season for the seething and we know that as soon as the snow is gone and spring plowing begins the boiling will all be over and forgotten in the rush and bustle bound to come with the long days; everything will be laid aside but the idea that we must have the biggest show on earth and in order to do that every man, woman and child must be for it all the time and get everybody else to be for it.</p>
<p>Superior Journal: Long strides are being made by the officers in charge toward the ultimate success of the 1898 Transmississippi Exposition, which is to be held in Omaha. This enterprise will not alone prove of great benefit to Nebraska's metropolis, but to the state and district at large. It will attract national attention to our resources and every indication is that it will be the introducing of a reign of genuine prosperity, which will be duly appreciated.</p>
<p>Pawnee Republican: The Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898 will be the greatest event in the history of the sate. As the World's fair was to Chicago so will the international exhibition be to Nebraska and no patriotic citizen should fail to give his best efforts toward the success of an enterprise whose ramifications will extend to every nook and corner of the state.</p>
<p>Gering Courier: Nebraska is interested as a state in the success of the proposed Transmississippi Exposition. We believe nothing can be done which will more tend to offset the unfavorable influence which resulted from the repeated drought years than the holding of a monster show in the state. Unless our own legislature comes to the front with a liberal appropriation for the exposition we cannot with justice ask other western states to participate, and inasmuch as the great preponderance of benefit will accrue to Nebraska the Courier is most heartily in favor of an appropriation of not less than $200,000. This is a minimum, and we believe still more would be warranted by the increase in the taxable property which will follow here as in every other state where such exhibitions have been carried on.</p>
<p>Niobrara Pioneer: The legislature should be very liberal in its aid of the Transmississippi Exposition. A good sized appropriation will be a cheaper advertisement for Nebraska lands and Nebraska people than the same amount expended otherwise. A return of prosperity for Nebraska means an increase in her population, and what better plan than for the legislature to incorporate in the appropriation bill authority for each county to appropriate an amount for the same good end? A reduction from the appropriations to county fairs for that season could well be made and transferred to the exposition appropriation.</p>
<p>Juniata Herald: The subject of greatest general interest for the coming year to Nebraskans will be the success of the proposed Transmississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898. Liberal subscriptions should be given to this great enterprise by our moneyed men and all business men generally. It will be a grand thing for our state and the western country generally, the scope of the exposition taking in not only our country, but practically the whole world and bringing to our very doors the men and means needed in the development of our great <choice><sic>emprie</sic><corr>empire</corr></choice>.</p>
<p>Nebraska City Press: The Press does not desire to harp on the question, yet it cannot refrain from calling the attention of the legislature to that portion of Governor Holcomb's message relating to the Transmississippi Exposition. All Nebraska is interested in the success of this mammoth undertaking and as this state will receive the greatest benefits it is necessary for Nebraskans to assume the leadership. Unfortunately the governor failed to mention any sum which in his estimation would be proper, but the legislature should not be stingy. By judicious management $100,000 can be saved to the state in the management of state institutions which can surely be run for two years on an economic basis when the reward in the end will be so great. Add to this $200,000 and you have a pretty fair start. Other states are appropriating $75,000 to $100,000 toward the enterprise and certainly Nebraska can judiciously afford to expend thrice the amount of any other commonwealth.</p>
<p>Randolph Times: The portion of the United States commonly called the "corn belt" is undoubtedly the richest in productiveness of any land or clime. Corn is synonymous with beef and pork, of the best quality on earth. This fact alone, however, only expressed in part the wonderful resources of the transmississippi country. The exposition at Omaha will reveal to the world the products of twenty-four of the greatest agricultural states in the union. By no other means could there be created such a world-wide interest in the middle west and particularly to Omaha as the exposition would. The star of empire is moving westward and the fact will be more fully recognized by the many thousands who will visit Omaha from far and near and witness for themselves what wonders western pluck and push can accomplish and has accomplished.</p>
<p>Alliance Guide: Our legislature will be asked to make a liberal appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha next year. The government has appropriated $200,000 for a national building and exhibit, and the citizens of our state metropolis are bestirring themselves most liberally and putting forth all the energy at their command to make the exposition a brilliant success. It goes without saying that every enterprising citizen in the state feels a deep interest in the Transmississippi Exposition, and the consensus of opinion throughout Nebraska is that the legislature should not be niggardly in this matter, since the state in general will be benefited according to the success of the enterprise. Hon. E. Rosewater of Omaha has been placed at the head of the Bureau of Publicity, which means that if the exposition is not the success it should be, no blame can attach to the advertising department.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">BANQUET TO VISITING ENGINEERS.</head>
<head type="sub">Exposition Experts Entertained by Local Engineers Last Night.</head>
<p>A very enjoyable complimentary banquet was tendered last night to H. C. Alexander and A. C. Shrader, the Chicago engineers who have been spending the week in the examination of the exposition sites. The dinner was given by their friends among the local engineering fraternity, and with its incidentals of appropriate toasts and good fellowship, made the guests thoroughly acquainted with truly Omaha hospitality. The banquet was spread in the private dining room at the Millard hotel. The tables were occupied at 8 o'clock, and, besides the guests of the evening, Curtiss C. Turner, E. J. Cornish, George Smith, Prof. R. C. Richards of Lincoln, Rev. S. Wright Butler, R. B. Howell, A. J. Grover, F. W. Marsh, A. K. Sault, George H. Pegram, A. D.

Stimson of Council Bluffs were among those who gathered around them.</p>
<p>An excellent menu was disposed of, after which the remainder of the evening was occupied with the toasts and responses. Curtiss C. Turner acted as toastmaster, and he introduced E. J. Cornish, who delivered an address of welcome to the visitors. Mr. Alexander and Mr. Schrader responded briefly, and then George Smith entertained the banqueters with some very interesting reminiscences of early engineering. Prof. Richards spoke on "Present Needs of the Profession in Nebraska." Rev. Butler contributed a witty discussion of the union depot, and City Engineer Howell spoke at some length on the subject of irrigation.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Exposition Directors Postpone Action on the Location.</head>
<p>The board of directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition association are in session this afternoon.</p>
<p>At 3 o'clock a resolution was introduced providing that the report of the engineers on location be held until after the legislature has disposed of the bill that was introduced by Dudley Smith. At the hour of going to press the resolution is being discussed.</p>
<p>The report of the engineers is sealed and is in the custody of Caspar E. Yost.</p>
<p>At a late hour this afternoon it was decided to postpone all action on the engineers' report and hold the same  unopened. No date for considering the report has been agreed upon.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">AMENDMENT TO EXPOSITION BILL.</head>
<head type="sub">Labor Union Asks that Nebraska Workmen Be Employed.</head>
<p>The Omaha Central Labor union has agreed upon an amendment to the transmississippi bill now before the legislature. The proposed amendment is:</p>
<p>That for the purpose that Nebraska's labor shall be properly protected and receive just compensation the minimum of $1.50 per eight hour day be paid on all work prosecuted by the state of Nebraska through its commissioners."</p>
<p>A lobby from the Central Labor union will visit Lincoln Monday to work for the amendment.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><p>There should be no star-chamber proceedings in connection with the engineers' report on the exposition site. The thousands of stockholders, whose right to know what is going on is in every way conceded, and the tens of thousands of citizens and property owners who may yet become stockholders, should receive all adequate assurance that the exposition will be located fairly and above board on the site honestly believed to be most suitable.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><dateline>THE EVENING BEE: MONDAY, <lb/> JANUARY 25, 1897.</dateline>
    <head type="sub">NEBRASKA FOR THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>Kearney Hub: There are a number of newspapers in this state that the Hub esteems very highly, that it is compelled to take issue with regarding the exposition appropriation. Some of these newspapers, and they are few, are disposed to saddle the whole enterprise onto Omaha and to make it appear as a private enterprise of that city. Again, a little of the Lincoln-Omaha antagonism appears, and this is just as senseless as the other. The state should make an out-and-out donation to the enterprise, with such provision as will give something in return when the exposition is concluded. If in addition the state desires to make a loan, that can be done also. In this matter Omaha stands for the state, the state stands for the Transmississippi country, and the section west of the Mississippi stands for the best that will be witnessed in the development of the  country during the next twenty years. The person, the newspaper or the community that attempts to block the enterprise or to hinder or discourage it will cut just about as much figure as a fly on an elephant's trunk. The thing for a few kickers to do is to stop kicking, fall in with public sentiment and public spirit, assist in making the exposition one of the greatest ever held in the country, and then live happy ever after.</p>
<p>Ponca Journal: The proposed Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha is an immense undertaking, requiring a vast expenditure of money, but it will prove of invaluable benefit to Nebraska and the whole middle west and far more than compensate the energy devoted to it. The legislature should not lag in performing its part, but stand up for the state and promote its welfare by a liberal appropriation, with which to aid in carrying out the great enterprise. The exposition will open in the spring of 1898 and remain in full blast until fall, and to make it a successful rival of the splendid Chicago fair of '93 will be the aim and effort of the management.</p>
<p>Fremont Herald: The Transmississippi Exposition will be a greater success than was at first figured on. The co-operation of states west of the Mississippi river is all that was expected when the enterprise was first planned, but the benefits to be derived are so apparent that states east of the Father of Waters wants to come in and there is a bill now before the Illinois legislature asking for an appropriation for that purpose. The more the merrier. If necessary, let's make it a world affair. Omaha can handle it.</p>
<p>Grand Island Independent: There is no opposition whatever in the state against an appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition, but the requisite amount is what is difficult to determine upon. It should be borne in mind, however, that Nebraska must lead in this enterprise if it expects other states to subscribe towards state buildings and exhibits. But there should be such provisions made as will guard against any reckless expenditure, such as that which characterized the World's fair appropriation.</p>
<p>Lincoln News: The people of Omaha have preferred a request of the state legislature that it appropriate the sum of $350,000 to aid the proposed Transmississippi Exposition to be held in that city next year. There seems to be considerable opposition among the members of the legislature to the voting of such a sum. Some of the objectors base their action on the ground that the financial condition of the state is such that they deem it unwise to tax the people so large an amount. Others affect to believe it simply an Omaha enterprise and argue that it is only a case of Omaha greed. The plain facts are these: The people of Nebraska, the majority of them, we believe, are heartily in favor of giving state aid to the exposition. All who read and think know that an exposition of the character contemplated by the management will draw largely from all sections of the country, especially from the east, where the west gets it money supply. Omaha will be benefited primarily, but the advantage to the state is well worth the expenditure of a considerable sum to insure the success of the exposition. It is scarcely necessary for the News to enlarge upon the benefits that will accrue to the state generally; all will recognize these. But there is one thing the people of the state outside of Omaha wish to be assured of, and that is that Omaha will do her part. We have been informed by the committee sent down here that the citizens of Omaha have given stock subscriptions amounting to $425,000. That is an excellent showing, but will it be paid. If it is, then the people of Nebraska can afford to do almost as well themselves. The News believes that if the legislature will pass a bill appropriating, say $300,000, to aid the exposition contingent upon the people of Omaha raising in cash $400,000&#8212;or in other words, pay out $3 for every $4 that Omaha will lay down&#8212;that such action will meet with the approval of the taxpayers generally.</p>
<p>Woman's Weekly (Omaha): The transmississippi bill will be up for discussion soon and we hope the Nebraska legislature will not attempt to be original on a proposition which is for the good of all concerned and about which there can be no two opinions among Nebraska people however it may seem to those of other states. Horace Greeley, or some one, said, "nothing succeeds like success," and while the expression may be so old that it is entitled to rest, it tells a truth. If we make the exposition a success at this end, it will be a success on all sides. If we believe in it, it will be the object of other people's hopes and desires. None can help it along like the legislature. None will reap such benefits as the farmer and the farmer's family. There can be no possible good come to the newspapers, for instance, except what comes from general prosperity, but the farmer and the farmer's wife will reap decided and immediate benefits. For a district of 200 miles everything in the way of edibles will advance in price to a great degree and the demand be very brisk. These must all come from the farms, and besides this small consideration will be the far greater one of lasting benefit in the way of advertising. Men will visit the exposition and look at the country. It will be a revelation to many. Immigration will be increased and farms will rise in value. These are reasons enough for the populists who are supposed to be farmers, for favoring the appropriation.</p>
<p>It is said by many that the exposition will be an Omaha affair, that Omaha will receive all the benefits. She will also receive the effects of the reaction which always follows an increase of population of an unsettled or temporary character. The outside portion of the state will not feel this latter result at all. I believe the exposition will benefit Omaha, but I believe it will benefit the whole state far more and the greatest benefit to Omaha will be, in the years to come, from the boost given to values in real estate and farms. It is a pity that men should not be able to see that the benefit must be mutual, or not at all, and the responsibility must be mutual, so far as the citizens of our state are concerned, or the exposition will be a failure. Vote for the bill, gentlemen, and do it with more vigor and heartiness than you have voted for anything lately. This is your opportunity; Omaha met hers when it was presented and will all the way through.</p>
<p>Gretna Reporter: We will forgive the legislature for repealing the sugar bounty law if it will but make an adequate appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition, but if it fails to do this then it has established the fact it is opposed to progress of any nature. Governor Holcomb in his message recommends a liberal appropriation. The people all over the state expect it and it will be poor economy indeed to refuse to make a reasonable appropriation. Nebraska will be immeasurably benefited by a good showing at the exposition and any apparent parsimony on the part of our people will detract from the future prosperity of our great state in the same ratio that our parsimony is apparent. Let the appropriation be sufficient to display our resources and advantages better, or at least as well, as our neighbor states. Illinois has already appropriated $100,000 and provided for the payment of any deficiency that might occur above that amount, and Nebraska should at the very least appropriate twice that amount. Nothing less will do.</p>
<p>Wilber Democrat: The Transmississippi Exposition is the biggest advertisement that has ever been attempted for Nebraska, as well as for the state beyond the Rockies. It is not a visionary, skyrocket scheme, but a well-matured effort to give the widest possible publicity to the advantages offered in this section to capitalists and homeseekers who have money with which to buy land and engage in industrial enterprises. There can be no question that the great west, with its limitless energy and its resistless push, will in 1898 present an exposition to the world the success of which will more than justify the most liberal appropriations this and other western states may make. Similar enterprises have resulted in building up other cities and states and there is every reason to expect it to do the same in this case.</p>
<p>Nehawka Register: We are sorry to see a disposition on the part of some members of the legislature to fight an appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition, which they call an "Omaha concern." This exposition means a great deal for Nebraska and we trust that the financial assistance given by the legislature will be liberal and sufficient, so that all the states west of the Mississippi may be thereby encouraged to lend their substantial aid.</p></div2></div1>

<head type="sub">WHY ALL THIS MYSTERY?</head>
<p>Why should the report of the consulting engineers employed to inspect the competing exposition sites be kept sealed like a verdict rendered by a jury? Was not the object of employing these engineers to get unbiased professional information that would enable the directors of the exposition to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the respective sites and come to a rational conclusion after mature and careful consideration? Why should this report be shrouded in mystery? These questions must force themselves upon the 6,000 stockholders in the exposition association who have a vital concern in the selection of the site that offers the greatest promise of insuring success.</p>
<p>Does it stand to reason that the board of directors can pass upon the location of buildings involving an outlay of from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 within thirty minutes after they have heard the engineers' report read? Why should not the report be printed in the daily press so that every one of the 6,000 stockholders may read and digest it and the directors act intelligently and to the best interests of the exposition? Will not the withholding of this report naturally create the subscription that there is a design to subserve private interests rather than the public interest, which should be paramount?</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><p>Nelson, Neb., Gazette: The Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898 is an enterprise the success of which depends upon the united labors of every Nebraskan in particular and the entire northwest in general. It will afford such an opportunity as has never been give the people of the midwest to encourage capital to invest here and assist in the development of our state. It will be the chance of a lifetime. The national congress will do its share; let the state legislature make as a liberal an appropriation as our finances will permit. Then with the energy of true western grit backing it up, the exposition will be equal to anything of the kind ever attempted.</p>
<p>Blair Pilot: Inasmuch as the Transmississippi Exposition will bring its first great good to Nebraska, our legislature should make a generous appropriation for the Nebraska display and to further the home interests in the undertaking Nebraska should be the center of attraction in the entire affair.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Fraternity Association Gives Its Time to an All-Absorbing Topic.</head>
<p>The meeting of the Business Men's Fraternity association held last night was devoted largely to a discussion of the proposed sites for holding the Transmississippi and International Exposition, after disposing of the routine matters. All of the proposed sites had their advocates and much time was consumed in detailing the particular advantages of the tracts proposed. In a most eloquent manner H. K. Burket explained why the exposition should go to Miller park, while Messrs. Bartlett and Mulford urged that there was no place like the East Omaha site. J. M. Welshans declared for the Elmwood park site and F. K. Darling raised his voice in praise of the beauties offered by the Riverview park site. H. H. Harder advocated the Hanscom park location and then proceeded to urge that if the exposition was located there it would result in great advantage to every portion of the city.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">Exposition Endorsements BY THE Transmississippi Press</head>
    <div3>
<p>Fort Worth (Tex.) Register: The Transmississippi country is feeling the effects of the turning tide of immigration. So long as the stream of new settles poured its flood of thousands of settlers and millions of investing capital into the fertile and undeveloped regions between the Rockies and the Father of Waters, so long the business of that vast section lying between the British possessions and the Indian territory went forward with ever-increasing strides under the stimulus of new population and increasing capital. But with the slack in the tide came stagnation. The country there is at a standstill in development. In western Kansas it is even retrograding in population and farms have turned to the primal wildness of the prairie and towns have become pictures of desolation. All that country feels the slackening of the tension which men and money keyed to the note of business success. Its business men would bring back the old-time conditions&#8212;would welcome the inflow of willing hands and plethoric pockets. So they have planned a great exposition. The exhibitions previously held at Philadelphia, Chicago, New Orleans and Atlanta brought large additions of population and capital to those cities and surrounding country. It is hoped that the same effect will be produced upon Omaha and the whole transmississippi region by the exposition now projected. As an advertisement of the resources and possibilities of a region nothing exceeds an exposition founded upon a scale commensurate with its possibilities of a region nothing exceeds an exposition founded upon a scale commensurate with its possibilities. And it may be said with equal truth that any section of the country can advance its interests by taking part in such an exposition. The possibilities of the south Atlantic states as fruit raising and truck farming localities were made known at the Columbian exposition in a manner that made possible the Atlanta exposition of last year and the consequent betterment of all the south Atlantic coast country. When the Transmississippi Exposition shall have materialized Texas should be represented there with all her wealth of mines, forests, fields and quarries. She should demonstrate to the business centers of the teeming northwest that her wheat is the best, her cotton staple the best, her coal fields the greatest and her forests the largest in all the land. She should be prepared on the spot to prove that her climate is the most salubrious, her range of agricultural products the widest, her opportunities for men of small means the most expansive, her markets the quickest and surest. Texas will wish godspeed to the Transmississippi Exposition, of which she will be a part.</p>
<p>Shelby (Ia.) News: The state legislature at its session this winter should see that an appropriation is made that will give Iowa a good showing at the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha in 1898. The state's advertisement at the World's fair went a great way toward showing up this state's resources and now that we have a fair right at home we should not let this opportunity pass. We have one of the best states in the union and we should take advantage of this opportunity to show off its good qualities. The state will undoubtedly see to it that a good appropriation is made.</p>
<p>Portland Oregonian: The promotion of world expositions has not been flourishing of late. The Nashville affair had to be postponed, and the Switzerland exposition closed untimely. This part of the world was so surfeited with the Midwinter fair at San Francisco, and the last feeble echo at Tacoma of the world's fair that the very name "exposition" became a byword and reproach. But time passes quickly and memory is short-lived. Perhaps an exposition in 1898 will be far enough away from Chicago's eighth wonder of the world for the faculty of sight-seeing to be rested, and for the "Transmississippi and International Exposition" announced for June of that year at Omaha to achieve success and usefulness.</p>
<p>Its prospectus, at any rate, is prepossessing. The preliminaries have been attended to. Congress passed and President Cleveland signed the act recognizing the enterprise, pledging the government to spend $200,000 for its building, and remitting duties on imported exhibits. Of the $1,000,000 stock $400,000 has been subscribed and the rest is almost assured. The directors include the first citizens of Nebraska, including ex-Senator Saunders, ex-Senator Manderson, railroad men like Holdrege of the Burlington and Kimball of the Union Pacific, and business men like Paxton, Millard, Creighton, Kountze and Korty. The further sum of $300,000 is expected from the general government and at least $250,000 from the state of Nebraska. The Department of Publicity is directed by so able a man as Editor Rosewater of The Omaha Bee.</p>
<p>These are promises of success that should materialize in achievement in time for exhibits of magnitude to be gathered in the whole transmississippi country. As this prospectus says, the Columbian exposition was practically monopolized by foreign exhibits, while the products of the transmississippi region&#8212;cismississippi, we ought to say&#8212;were merely an incident to the great aggregation. In the Omaha exposition it is proposed to "focalize attention upon the marvelous resources and capabilities of the transmississippi states." If the enterprise attains its now contemplated measure of success Oregon should be represented in it, and doubtless will be. The state legislature now in session will hardly set aside state money for the purpose and should not do so unless discretion to forego its expenditure were lodged in the governor or some such repository of authority. But as soon as the Omaha exposition has demonstrated its success the citizens of Oregon will bestir themselves and make as good a showing, relatively, as they did at Chicago in 1893.</p>
<p>Renwick (Ia.) Times: The Transmississippi Exposition is the biggest advertisement that has ever been attempted for the Mississippi valley and the states beyond the Rockies. It is not a visionary skyrocket scheme, but a well planned and well matured effort to give the widest possible publicity to the advantages offered in this section to capitalists and homeseekers who have money with which to buy land and engage in agricultural enterprises. The Atlanta Cotton State exposition turned the tide of immigration and capital from the west to the south. The aim of the exposition of 1898 is to set forth the advantages and limitless resources of states west of the Mississippi and thus attract homeseekers and investors.</p>
<p>Minneapolis Improvement Bulletin: Omaha is evidently thoroughly in earnest in its efforts to make the Transmississippi and International Exposition a notable success. It is true that in no previous exposition have the resources and products and possibilities of the great transmississippi section been given an adequate setting forth. To do this is the distinctive purpose of the exposition of 1898, and the Improvement Bulletin bespeaks for the enterprise general and generous co-operation.</p>
<p>Decatur (Tex.) News: That which should meet the instant approval of the people of the western states, and especially Texas, is the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held in Omaha, Neb., from June until November in 1898. Texas should be represented with an abundant display of its wondrous resources, as this is a central locality and will be visited by a vast number of the people of the United States and foreign countries.</p>
<p>Blue Rapids (Kan.) Motor: The Transmississippi and International Exposition, which will be held at Omaha next year, means much for the prosperity of the west, and it is not now too early to commence laying plans for its success. What the World's fair was to Illinois, the Centennial to Pennsylvania, the New Orleans exposition to Louisiana, the Atlanta exposition to Georgia and the San Francisco Midwinter fair to California, so will this exposition be to Nebraska and Kansas. It will bring thousands of visitors to the west who will leave millions of dollars on this side of the Missouri river. The resources and the possibilities of the two states will be advertised as never before. The benefits will be permanent. It is to the interest of every Kansan to use his influence for the success of this exposition.</p>
<p>Phoenix (Ariz.) Gazette: There will be held in the city of Omaha, Neb., in 1898 an exposition to display the resources of states and territories west of the Mississippi river. The Transmississippi Commercial congress, held in 1895, declared in favor of the same and congress has appropriated $200,000 towards a government exhibit. There will be an effort made during the present session to have the amount increased to $500,000. The state of Nebraska will probably appropriate $250,000 and an association has been formed with an authorized capital of $1,000,000, with $400,000 already paid. When the time comes no doubt Arizona will be represented, as the display is intended to show the marvellous resources of the west beyond the Father of Waters.</p>

    <p>Wadena, (Minn.) Journal: There is to be a Transmississippi and International Exposition at Omaha, Neb., in 1898. The purpose is to focalize attention upon the marvelous resources and capabilities of the transmississippi states. Careful preparations are being made to push the enterprise, and there is promise of success. It is expected that the several states will make liberal appropriations for exhibits.</p>
<p>Lyons (Kan.) Republican: The Transmississippi Exposition is the biggest advertisement that has ever been attempted for the Mississippi valley and the states beyond the Rockies. It is not a visionary, skyrocket scheme, but a well-planned and well-matured effort to give the widest possible publicity to the advantages offered in this section to capitalists and homeseekers who have money with which to buy land and engage in instrumental enterprises. The Atlantic Cotton States exposition turned the tide of immigration and capital from the west to the south. The aim of the exposition of 1898 is to set forth the advantages and limitless resources of states west of the Mississippi and thus attract homeseekers and investors.</p>
<p>Pineville (Mo.) Democrat: The campaign is now on for a Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha, Neb., during the summer of 1898. The history of all the great expositions held anywhere in this country since the Centennial at Philadelphia has been that of great good to the whole country. If the one now being gotten under way at Omaha is pushed on to successful opening it will be of untold advantage to the entire country west of the Mississippi river, and Missouri would receive its full share. In all probability our state legislature will be called upon for an appropriation for the proper representation of our interests at that exposition, and nothing niggardly should be done. In fact, imperial Missouri should be at the head of the column.</p>
<p>Minneapolis Chronicle: The project of holding a Transmississippi and International Exposition at Omaha next year is being agitated. It is proposed to open in June, 1898, and continue till November. Minnesota is expected to take part in the work of helping to make the exposition a success, on the ground that it will prove a benefit in a material way to this state, by a full exhibit showing its mineral wealth, its agricultural products and its resources in all the varied lines.</p>
<p>Fessenden, (N. D.) News: We have received from E. Rosewater, editor of The Omaha Bee, a prospectus of the Transmississippi and International Exposition, to be held at Omaha, Neb., from June 1 to November 1, 1898. In the World's Columbian exposition of 1893 the exhibits of the transmississippi states were overshadowed by the exhibits of foreign countries. Of the millions who passed through its gates, comparatively few carried away with them a distinct impression of the productive resources of that vast empire. The purpose of the projectors of the Transmississippi Exposition is to acquaint the nation and visitors from other countries with the fabulous wealth and stupendous possibilities of the greater west. This enterprise should have the hearty support of all North Dakotans, and we would suggest that the present legislature take some action toward creating a commission and making an appropriation that our state may be properly represented in this great exposition. It is of vital importance that the matter be given careful consideration and that prompt and ardent action be taken. This will be a great display and North Dakota should not be a laggard in the procession.</p>
<p>Mankota (Minn.) Free Press: Next year the west will have a big exposition of its own in what will be known as the Transmississippi Exposition that is to be held in Omaha from June 1 to November 1. The main object of this exposition is to give the states west of the Mississippi a chance to make an exhibit to the world of their resources and productive industries, and that the showing will be a great one cannot be questioned and ought to prove of great benefit to the west. The state of Minnesota ought to take steps this winter to see that it is properly represented at the said exposition in 1898.</p></div3></div2>
    
<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">LOCATING THE EXPOSITION.</head>    
<p>OMAHA, Jan. 19.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: I see you invite discussion on sites for the location of the exposition. I have read letters from Mr. McDonald and others advocating the Hanscom park site. It seems to me that we have enough in the park now, so the "permanent buildings" are a myth.</p>
<p>It is too hilly and rough with the adjoining ground for such purposes, making it altogether too wearing on the pedestrian and an extra unnecessary and unreasonable tax on the patience and muscle of the poor "chair wheeler." The streets to and from are entirely too hilly, making double the pull on all teams and over which the hack and carryalls all claim they must charge double, besides killing their teams, thus giving the Humane society so much extra labor. The most important objection is the matter of transportation of the immense crowds anticipated.</p>
<p>We all know there is but one line of street railway to the park. The Thirty-second street line spoken of is misleading and so unfair, as it is only a spur of the one line, every other car on the line running around that way. So far as half or two-thirds of the people of Omaha and South Omaha walking, there is little doubt of that if they went, for there would be nothing to ride on. We have a sad experience of this great question and the hilly streets with the two years of the state fair. It has cost the society in those two years $25,000 and has cost the city of Omaha many a kick from people who will never visit it again. Now, let us not make this error in this, the crowning event of our city. We have plenty of level ground, reached by level, paved streets, reached by the largest water main, the largest sewer, four separate lines of street railway via Sherman avenue, North Twentieth street, Hanscom park and North Twenty-fourth, besides the Belt Line Railway, over which all roads may bring in their trains; the Fremont, Elkhorn &amp; Omaha railroad. I think any of your readers can guess the location from the foregoing. It is Miller park. I have been among the ranch people of Colorado and Wyoming during the past six months, a great many of whom come to Omaha with stock and are well acquainted with the city and its streets. These men say should the exposition location be among the hills, as the fair is, it will kill it among a great many. I have also visited a great many farmers in western Nebraska and western Iowa, where I am at work now, and the same feeling exists among them.</p>
<p>I can give you the names and postoffice addresses of at least 500 of them and each will write you if asked to locate the exposition on level ground.</p>
<p>One thing I neglected to say in relation to the street railway service. All but the Hanscom park line starts from the union depot at its present site. Now, taking the opinion of hundreds of people who will have to be relied on for patronage, and to ignore the lack of water for lakes, etc., and it seems to me that no other location has the advantages which Miller park presents.</p>
<p>Let us make no mistakes. L. V. CRUM</p>
<p>OMAHA, Jan. 20.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: There seems to be a preconceived plan to have regular installments of communications through the channel of your paper to create sentiment in favor of the "Poor Farm site," designated under the more popular name, but misleading as to location, as the "Hanscom Park site." The basis of the appeal for this site is, in my opinion, a flagrant and gross violation of the original intention and declaration that this Exposition should be, first, for the great transmississippi region; that it should be upon the broadest and most liberal conception, and under no consideration should it be narrowed to the local interests of Omaha, or be made to subserve the selfish interests of any class of her citizens. Now, here, at the initial step of the first active work, the selection of a site, comes the talk of "near in," "Omaha's interest," "gate receipts," "permanent buildings," etc. I would not deprecate Omaha's interest, or the welfare of its citizens. I would bring to Omaha every blessing and advantage, and open to Omaha every avenue to wealth and advancement, but would remind our people that the greater benefits and advantages from the exposition is not to be measured by "trade and traffic," "gate receipts," etc. Therefore, we cannot afford to circumscribe the exposition by selecting for it a site inadequate to its demands in order to satisfy local self-interests. These <choice><sic>thing</sic><corr>things</corr></choice> are important, and should be in their measure subserved. The location will be best for the highest interest of the exposition, the states and territories of the transmississippi region, our own state and city, which meets to the fullest degree the broadest gauge requirements and demands of the exposition, and be most easily accessibly by every class of vehicle, and furnish easy, cheap and rapid transit. Distance is measured by time and ease and cheapness of access to the objective point. It is practically but half as far on the level as it is climbing up hill and down, even though the actual distance be twice as great. The wide and boundless transmississippi region, with its demand for space, is compared to the compact tenements of Paris and New York, and we are asked to hold an exposition adequate to the wants of this great region in a prescribed area of 125 acres, hardly one-half of which is suitable for buildings.</p>
<p>The World's fair at Chicago required more than 600 acres and our exposition will represent more than one-half of the biggest broadest part of the United States, being the transmississippi end, and the international contingent, embracing the world at large. The Nashville exposition covers more than 200 acres and it does not rise to the shadow of our ambition for this great enterprise. The interest of irrigation, so important to the people of the western states at this time, should demand that we set apart at least 100 acres to this feature alone and make it one of the special attractions.</p>
<p>The field we cover has great agricultural and stock raising resources, requiring outdoor space to make proper and practical displays,and the site selected should comprehend these wants, affording all the ground necessary upon the proper level nearest to the center of the city, considering its ease of accessibility, cheapness and rapidity of transit to and from.</p>
<p>If it is the purpose and design to direct this exposition to the local interests of Omaha, let us proceed to do this on a practical plan that means something. Let us use the money subscribed and appropriated for the purchase of several blocks of ground near the business center of the city and for the erection thereon of suitable and permanent buildings, containing convention halls, museums, art galleries, permanent exposition quarters, etc., that the states and territories comprising the transmississippi country may not be restricted to the few central months of 1898, but may maintain at the gateway of this great region an exhibition of their wonderful resources at all times.</p>
<p>I would appeal for the greater and paramount interest of the exposition in considering the selection of the site, conceiving that therein lies the glory and greater achievement for Omaha. Let us say to the transmississippi section and to the world that Omaha is for the exposition, and not the exposition for Omaha. Our people will, I believe, be loyal to the enterprise, whether it is dumped into the ravines of Riverview or hidden away in the valley of the "Little Pappio;" but I fear they will not be content if it is taken "over the hills to the poor house." Therefore, what is the matter with the Miller park site, with its 500 or more beautiful acres? R. W. RICHARDSON.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><dateline>THE EVENING BEE: FRIDAY, JANUARY 22, 1897.</dateline>
    <head type="main">Locating the Exposition</head>
<p>OMAHA, Jan. 21.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: I present herewith a few of the reasons why Miller park should be the preference of the board of directors for the exposition site:</p>
<p>1. Because it is a Transmississippi and International exposition and comprises the twenty-four states of the transmississippi country, whose principal resources are agricultural, grazing and mining pursuits and can only be shown by placing the exposition on a large tract, such as is offered in the Miller park proposition, making it possible to show all the advantages of a thoroughly equipped irrigated farm. If the exposition were to be held in a manufacturing district, 200 acres might be sufficient; but, as is stated, it is in part the exposition of an agricultural district, which will require sufficient room to make a creditable showing.</p>
<p>2. Because it is accessible by all railroads running into Council Bluffs via the new bridge of the Bridge and Terminal company, bringing us into immediate relation with Iowa, one of the first states to recognize the importance of the great enterprise. It is also reached by the Missouri Pacific, the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha and the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley on all sides. The Belt Line under its charter must give to all roads desirous of entering the city the right of way over that line, which makes it possible for every road in the state to reach the grounds. Four lines of street railway are within a short distance of all sides. The beautiful and only boulevard reaches the main entrance, while paved streets favor the proposed site to the gates, all being on a straight level and direct route from the center and business portion of the city.</p>
<p>3. Because it is the only place where water can be had without great cost to the exposition company. The great water main, thirty-six inches in diameter, on Twenty-fourth street; also the thirty-inch main on Thirtieth street, which originally furnished water to the abandoned Fort Omaha, could be used without materially affecting the present pressure of the water works, which would be furnished free to the exposition company only on this site. This advantage will make it almost impossible for the destruction of the buildings and contents by fire and furnish water for a series of proposed lakes and fountains which will beautify the grounds.</p>
<p>4. Because leases for 400 acres are ready for delivery free of cost to the exposition company. Also 100 feet bounding the entire site on all sides to be used as directed by the board of directors. The above mentioned 400 acres will require no grading and is of a rolling nature so every building could be shown to great advantage, while the complete water system already in Fort Omaha will save a great deal of expense and the general distribution of beautiful trees.</p>
<p>5. Because it is desired by most of our citizens to make some of the buildings permanent and that can only be done on public property. If this is done an offer is made in the original proposition by which F. W. Parker will donate to the city his collection of curiosities, which has been collected all over the world and is estimated to be worth $30,000. By locating on this site on of our best park tracts will be improved and beautified without additional cost to the city.</p>
<p>6. Because I believe the sentiment of the people is in favor of this site and believe that it should be placed on a broader scale, governed by a broader mind than is being done by some of the directory, remembering it is not only to benefit a few Omaha business men, but the entire transmississippi section. DAVE H. CHRISTIE.</p>
<p>OMAHA, Jan. 21.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: If it is true, as Mr. Richardson asserts, that your paper is a medium through which the friends of the Hanscom park site may create sentiment in favor of this site, then we think it time that those in favor of this location begin to make use of the opportunity and utilize at least half as much space in The Bee as has been found necessary to give expression to the Miller park advocates.</p>
<p>The "spreading out idea" of our Miller park friends is their argument in chief. This same lunacy of certain real estate men has not only brought ruin to themselves, but to hundreds of other people in Omaha, and now those who were caught out in the rain with their real estate, near Florence and the Washington county line, seek to avert the result of their own folly at the expense of the masses of the people now in Omaha and of those who will be in Omaha in 1898 from other states. Those who advocate the Hanscom park site have no corporate or selfish individual interests at stake. They are for this site because it is pre-eminently the logical site, if not the only site, where the exposition can be located to the complete advantage and convenience of every man, woman and child who attends the exposition, whether from San Francisco, New York, Chicago, New Orleans or Omaha, or from rural communities in the different states. They will all be in Omaha when they attend the exposition.</p>
<p>It certainly will be to the delight and approval of those from abroad to find the exposition located near the principal hotels of the city, lying between the two most beautiful residence portions of Omaha, the grounds flower gardened and beautified in Parisian glory overlooking the transmississippi metropolis. W. A. C.</p>
<p>OMAHA, Jan. 21.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: I am a laboring man, and in behalf of the laboring men I would like to see the exposition site located as convenient to the homes of the laboring men of Omaha as it can be. If it goes to Elmwood or Miller park, the men who live in Omaha, and many of them who are trying to pay taxes and pay for their homes, have got to deduct car fare from their already small wages, as well as put in so much extra time in going and coming, while outside labor will flock in and stop at the cheap boarding houses which will be built where the fair is located and will have the best of Omaha labor. Car fare might seem like a small thing to most of your readers, but if this show is as big as they are planning it will take a great many men to put it in shape for 1898, and the car fare altogether will amount to something like $15,000 or $20,000. I do not see why this amount cannot be saved to the laboring men as well as given to the street car of railway companies.</p>
<p>GUS PETERSON.</p>
<p>OMAHA, JAN. 22.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: Elmwood park site has everything to recommend it to the directors as the only logical site for the exposition. It contains 385 acres of public land located just three and one-half miles west from the postoffice. Elmwood park is Omaha's largest park; it contains 215 acres of land; it has shade trees and plenty of them; it has excellent water in abundance; it is a beautiful tract of land and should be improved; it is only a twenty-minute ride from the business center of the city by the electric car line but if the Omaha Street Railway company would do the right thing for the western part of this city it could make the run in much less time and give satisfaction to its patrons.</p>
<p>Elmwood park site would be a permanent benefit to the public, a saving to the taxpayers, a profitable income for the transportation companies for all time. It is the only site that can be conveniently reached by all the people of Omaha, South Omaha and Council Bluffs. The Nebraska legislature might demand that this exposition be located on public property.</p>
<p>W. WEBSTER.</p>
<p>OMAHA, Jan. 21.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: The friends of Riverview park, in advocacy of that site for the exposition, desire through your columns to state to the public the following facts:</p>
<p>Treating the Paxton hotel as the central point of the street cars, hotels and population of Omaha and South Omaha, measured by the blocks necessarily traveled and not by an air line, the Riverview park site is five blocks nearer to the Paxton hotel than any other site suggested. To make this more fully appear we give distances measured in blocks of the ordinary size: Riverview Park site, or poor farm site, thirty-two; fair ground site, seventy; East Omaha site, sixty-five; Miller park site, seventy blocks.</p>
<p>If Sixteenth and Farnam streets is chosen as the center, then the Riverview park site is but one block nearer town than the poor farm site, but we submit that taking Council Bluffs into consideration the Paxton hotel is the fairer point from which to measure.</p>
<p>As to water: The Riverview park site has an artesian well. The springs in Syndicate park, three blocks west, which formerly supplied all South Omaha and the packing houses with water, can be piped into the ground, dispensing with the necessity of ice and giving cool drinking water at all points. In addition to that the city water now at Sixth and Bancroft, Eleventh and Bancroft, on Tenth street to the south line of the park, Thirteenth street along the side of the park, and on Twentieth street, the South Omaha thirty-six inch main can be made available. If the Nebraska legislature, as seems probable, attaches to the conditions of its appropriation, the provision that a sample irrigated farm shall be one of the features, the land adjoining Riverview park and between it and the Missouri river is the only land in any of the sites available for such purpose in its general contour, and is the only land in which the water for irrigating purposes could be obtained at slight cost either from the Missouri river or from the artesian well without the great cost to the water works company.</p>
<p>In addition to the foregoing, which has not been called to the attention of the public, we may add the following reasons why the exposition should be located at Riverview park:</p>
<p>It is the only site that presents a view of the Missouri river and the bottom lands, bluffs, woods, cornfields and lakes that line its banks, making the one unique, distinctive Omaha landscape.</p>
<p>It is the only site that possesses forest trees in abundance.</p>
<p>It is the only site that possesses pure, healthy, cold mineral water and artesian water.</p>
<p>It is the only site where the Missouri river can be made available for excursion boats and as a means of transportation to and from the grounds.</p>
<p>It has perfect sewerage.</p>
<p>It is accessible by the Thirteenth street car line, and by the proposed street car extension down Tenth and Sixth streets, and from South Omaha, and also by B. &amp; M. railway and river steamers.</p>
<p>On the road hither is presented the broadest and most imposing view possible of the city of Omaha.</p>
<p>The grounds are susceptible of great ornamentation at slight expense.</p>
<p>It is not confined and shut out from refreshing breezes and inspiring views in a hollow or on the bottom.</p>
<p>It is the coolest place in summer.</p>
<p>The odors from the packing houses are not wafted to it on the south wind, the prevailing wind in the heated season.</p>
<p>It is the most healthy location and less subject to contagious disease by reason of low, marshy grounds or bad sewerage.</p>
<p>It is the only site upon which the buildings would be in plain view of every train coming into Council Bluffs and Omaha.</p>

<p>OMAHA, Jan. 22.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: The letters of L. V. Crum and R. W. Richardson in last night's Bee demand an answer, as they have not clearly stated the facts in the case. I am an advocate of the site that is selected, but in all fairness each site should be properly represented before a selection is made by the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>1. Mr. Crum says "permanent buildings are a myth." It is generally conceded that if we do not succeed in getting some permanent improvement as a result of the Exposition that it will not be the success that it should be. Level-headed Chicago men will tell you today that their greatest mistake was that they received no permanent improvements on the grounds as a result of the great fair.</p>
<p>2. He says "it is too hilly and rough." This is not so. A great majority of the site is level, or can be made enough so by a very little work, and engineers say that a site that is somewhat uneven can be made much more attractive and beautiful than a level tract at the same expense.</p>
<p>3. The streets to and from the site are not hilly. There is only one small hill on Leavenworth street, from Sixteenth to Twentieth. In fact, there is more driving on the streets leading to and surrounding Hanscom park than any other portion of the city.</p>
<p>4. Mr. Crum says, "Hacks and carryalls claim they must charge double." What rot. There is not a hack or carryall driver in Omaha today but will take you from the center of town to Thirty-fourth and Leavenworth streets, or Thirty-second and Woolworth avenue, the proposed entrance to the Hanscom park site, for one-half the price he will take you to Miller park, and take you there in one-third of the time.</p>
<p>5. The statement that there is only one motor line to the Hanscom park site is refreshing, considering the fact that Miller park has none. The nearest is equally close to the Hanscom park site, and is no closer to Miller park than the Farnam street line to Hanscom park site. While the Leavenworth street line, with its three branches runs to three proposed entrances, and other lines, the Farnam street for instance, can be connected fully as easy as any lines can be run to Miller park. Again, the Belt Line runs around the entire city, and to South Omaha, and passes the Hanscom park site on the west. In all probability the Thirty-second street line would be extended to South Omaha, which would make another <note>article ends abruptly.</note></p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">PARKS AND EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">One Way the City Can Aid if a Park Is Used.</head>
<p>The park commission has decided to ask the city council for a levy of 2 <choice><sic>mills</sic><corr>mills.</corr></choice> The exposition was discussed by the commission, and it was also decided that should it be located in one of the parks, and the exposition management make a request to that effect, that the commission will amend its request to the council, making it 3 instead of 2 mills. Up to the present time the only practical method, in the opinion of the park commissioners, by which the city can officially aid the exposition is through the commission in the line of grading and preparing the grounds, providing, of course, that it is located in a park. The commission is divided as to the advisability of the city taking such action but will be governed wholly by public sentiment upon it.</p>
<p>The park commission expresses a willingness to do anything in reason in the matter of moving to other offices in order to allow the board of health to move into its present quarters, but as both the park commission and the board of health may be abolished within the next sixty days it takes the position that no expense should be incurred until the action of the legislature on the different charter revision bills is known.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Foreign Exhibits, Non-Resident Subscriptions and Engineers' Report.</head>
<p>Secretary Wakefield of the exposition association has received from Congressman Mercer a copy of the rules of the treasury department that will govern the receipt and handling of exhibits coming from foreign countries. They are similar to, if not identical with, the rules that have prevailed for preceding expositions. All exhibits will pass through the hands of the collector of customs, and the buildings of the exposition will constitute an immense government bonded warehouse, under the charge of a customs agent specially appointed.</p>
<p>The department of ways and means is now devoting itself to the task of getting subscriptions from non-resident property holders. These include insurance companies and big investors in real estate and mortgage loans. The heads of the department say that they are not forgetting that there are several men of large property in Omaha who have not subscribed, and they will be solicited in good time and with vigor.</p>

<head type="sub">QUESTION TO BE CONSIDERED TOMORROW</head>
<head type="sub">Report of the Experts Will Contain a Recommendation of One of the Five Sites that Are Offered.</head>
        <div3>
<p>The meeting of the Board of Directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition tomorrow afternoon to receive the report of the experts employed to examine the five sites offered promises to be an animated session. The report of the engineers will be presented to the board and it will contain a recommendation of one of the sites, with reasons why that particular one should be selected. The meeting will then be agitated over the question of whether the report shall be acted upon at once and the site selected, or whether the matter shall be made the subject of extended discussion and deliberation and the selection of the site deferred for a week longer. There are many indications going to show that both sides of this question will have warm supporters. Some of the directory are strongly in favor of having the question decided at once. The most vigorous of these are among those who are boldly proclaimed by the supporters of a certain site as being in favor of that site. The position which would be taken by these members in the event that the engineers should strongly recommend some other site is uncertain. The more conservative members of the board favor a deliberate course and say the question of location should be given the most careful consideration. They favor deferring action until the report of the engineers can be thoroughly digested and all the members of the board thoroughly posted on the qualifications of each of the sites.</p>
<p>The engineers have decided to include in their report a recommendation of what they regard as the best site. What site this will be they have vouchsafed no indication, and they say they will not indicate in any way, to any person, what this recommendation will be, but will submit their findings in a sealed communication to the committee authorized to employ them, and Chairman Yost of the special committee is authority for the statement that this report will be handed unopened to the full meeting of the directors.</p></div3>
        <div3>
<head type="sub">CALLED ON THE ENGINEERS.</head>
<p>The promoters of the Riverview park site stole a march upon their rivals this morning and sent a delegation to interview the engineering experts, with additional arguments why the park down on the bluffs overlooking the Missouri should be selected as an exposition site. This delegation comprised E. J. Cornish, Ernest Stuht, Dr. Hanchett, John Powers and Police Judge Gordon. they had a talk with Mr. Alexander, one of the experts, and presented arguments in addition to those used when the site was visited by the engineers. They said the legislature would probably attach a provision to any appropriation which would require the establishment of an irrigated farm on the exposition grounds; they urged that the bottom lands forming a part of the proposed site on the south side was the only place suitable for such an exhibit. They also called attention to the springs in Syndicate park, three blocks west of Riverview park, and said the water from these could be piped to the Exposition grounds at slight expense. They also presented other reasons and wanted the engineers to visit the site again, but the invitation was declined, Mr. Alexander saying they had no further time to spare for that purpose.</p></div3>
        <div3>
<head type="sub">FIRST APPLICATION FOR SPACE.</head>
<p>The first application for space for an exhibit at the Exposition was filed this morning. The applicant was Farrell &amp; Co., the local manufacturers of syrup, jellies, etc. Application was made for 1,500 feet, and the jocose manager of the house laid claim in advance to the gold medal.</p>
<p>The Department of Promotion announces that it is now prepared to furnish business men with circular letters to be sent to their correspondents. These letters are designed to awaken an interest in this and adjoining states in legislature action, and will be supplied by the department to any business man who will send them out in his mail.</p>
<p>That the Exposition is attracting attention in every part of the United States is evident from the flood of communications that come to Mayor Broatch to inquire in regard to various facts connected with the enterprise. From a dozen to thirty such communications are received every day and they come from every state and territory in the union. They are from people who want to know about various matters pertaining to the Exposition proper and from others who inquire in regard to dry goods establishments, industrial enterprises and public improvements, evidently with a view to prospective possibilities of obtaining employment. Some of the letters are answered by Secretary Wertz and others are turned over to the managers of the Exposition.</p></div3></div2>

<div3>
<p>Among those who are most interested, for personal and local reasons, in the selection of a site for the Trans-Mississippi exposition there has been a good deal of doubt as to just what sort of report the Chicago engineers, Messrs. Alexander and Schrader, who have been inspecting the sites proposed, will make. The engineers have been in some doubt on this point themselves, the question being whether to recommend a definite site or simply to describe from their standpoint the advantages and disadvantages of all the sites and express no preference.</p>
<p>They have come to the conclusion, however, that the resolution under which they were employed contemplates something more definite than a general discussion of the availability and suitability of the several locations, and they will, therefore, in submitting their findings, express their approval of a particular site. They agree with the suggestions made by others that if a statement simply of the features of each site was the only thing wanted, home engineers could readily and impartially have furnished it, while they might possibly not have been able to make an impartial recommendation of a particular location. Indeed that is <choice><sic>was</sic><corr></corr></choice> precisely for the purpose of avoiding any personal influence in the latter respect that the outside engineers were called for.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">NO SIGNS GIVEN.</head>
<p>The promoters of the various locations have eagerly watched for any expressions on the part of Mr. Alexander or Mr. Schrader that might indicate how the subject was beginning to shape itself in their minds, but they have watched in vain. The two men have been, it is conceded, about as non-committal on the matter as two men could possibly be, but the impression with many is that they favor the poor farm location. A more general impression is that their preference lies between the poor farm site and Riverview park. At any rate, it is certain that promoters of these sites have doubled their efforts to have the experts see the subject just as they respectively see it.</p>
<p>A significant circumstance was the nature of the remarks made by a delegation of South Side people that called on Mr. Alexander yesterday morning. The delegation comprised Councilman Stuht, Attorney Cornish, John Powers, Police Judge Gordon and Dr. Hanchett. They confined themselves to correcting alleged false representations that had been made respecting their site by the poor farm champions. These points touched the distance of the site from the center of the city, its water supply and the facilities it might offer for an irrigation farm.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">POOR FARM SITE.</head>
<p>If the report of the experts should be favorable to the poor farm site, there is one South Sider who believes that the report and the weight of sentiment in the directory will coincide, for he says that a poll of the directors now shows that the majority are in favor of the poor farm site. This is not admitted by the Miller park people, who claim enough support to determine the choice.</p>
<p>So persistent have the site advocates become that the experts have to suffer considerable interruption in formulating their report. They say, however, that it will be ready to hand to Mr. Yost, sealed, this morning. They do not expect to get away from the city until this evening, but will not be present at the meeting of the directors, unless pressed to attend.</p>
<p>As definite a statement as the experts have made was given by Mr. Alexander Saturday, when he said that there was more than one of the sites proposed which might be <note>article ends abruptly></note></p></div3></div2>

    <head type="sub">THE PUBLIC PULSE,</head>
<head type="sub">Riverview Park.</head>
<p>Omaha, Jan. 22.&#8212;To the Editor of the World-Herald: the friends of Riverview park, in advocacy of that site for the exposition, desire through your columns to state to the public the following facts:</p>
<p>Treating the Paxton hotel as the central point of the street cars, hotels, and population of Omaha and South Omaha, measured by the blocks necessarily traveled and not by an air line, the Riverview park site is five blocks nearer to the Paxton hotel than any other site suggested. To make this more fully appear we give distances measured in blocks of the ordinary size. Riverview park site, twenty-eight blocks; the so-called Hanscom park site, or poor farm site, thirty-two blocks; fair grounds site, seventy blocks; East Omaha site, sixty-five blocks; Miller park site, seventy blocks.</p>
<p>If Sixteenth and Farnam streets is chosen as the center then the Riverview park site is but one block nearer town than the poor farm site, but we submit that taking Council Bluffs into consideration the Paxton hotel is the fairer point from which to measure.</p>
<p>As to water: The Riverview park site has an artesian well. The springs in Syndicate park, three blocks west, which formerly supplied all South Omaha and the packing houses with water, can be piped into the ground, dispensing with the necessity of ice and giving cool drinking water at all points. In addition to that the city water now at Sixth and Bancroft, Eleventh and Bancroft, on Tenth street to the south line of the park, Thirteenth street along the side of the park, and on Twentieth street the South Omaha thirty-six inch main can be made available.</p>
<p>If the Nebraska legislature, as seems probable, attaches to the conditions of its appropriation the provision that a sample irrigated farm shall be one of the features, the land adjoining Riverview park and between it and the Missouri river is the only land in any of the sites available for such purpose in its general contour, and is the only land in which the water for irrigating purposes could be obtained at slight cost either from the Missouri river or from the artesian well without the great cost to the water works company.</p>
<p>In addition to the foregoing, which has not been called to the attention of the public, we may add the following reasons why the exposition should be located at Riverview park:</p>
<p>It is the only site that presents a view of the Missouri river and the bottom lands, bluffs, woods, corn fields and lakes that line its banks, making the one unique, distinctive Omaha landscape.</p>
<p>It is the only site that possesses forest trees in abundance.</p>
<p>It is the only site that possesses pure, healthy, cold mineral and artesian water.</p>
<p>It is the only site where the Missouri river can be made available for excursion boats as a means of transportation to and from the grounds.</p>
<p>It has perfect sewerage.</p>
<p>It is accessible by the Thirteenth street car line, and by the proposed street car extension down Tenth and Sixth streets and from South Omaha, and also by Burlington &amp; Missouri railway and river steamers.</p>
<p>On the road hither is presented the <choice><sic>proadest</sic><corr>broadest</corr></choice> and most imposing view possible of the city of Omaha.</p>
<p>The grounds are susceptible of great ornamentation at slight expense.</p>
<p>It is not confined and shut out from refreshing breezes and inspiring views in a hollow or on the bottom.</p>
<p>It is the coolest place in summer.</p>
<p>The odors from the packing houses are not wafted to it on the south wind, the prevailing wind in the heated season.</p>
<p>It is the most healthy location and less subject to contagious disease by reason of low marshy grounds or bad sewerage.</p>
<p>It is the only site upon which the building would be in plain view of every train coming into Council Bluffs and Omaha.</p>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">Labor Interests and the Exposition Site.</head>
<p>Omaha, Jan. 19.&#8212;To the Editor of the World-Herald: it is currently reported that the labor representative on the board of directors of the Trans-Mississippi exposition favors Miller park. He has probably given the subject careful consideration and can give his <choice><sic>constitutents</sic><corr>constituents</corr></choice> good and sufficient reasons for his preference, but there is one item which should be taken into consideration by the laboring men in the location of this exposition, i. e., car fare. There should be no car fare when the work is within a mile and a half of the homes of the laborers. The one and a half mile limit from the main portion of the Hanscom park or poor farm site includes the northern boundary of South Omaha, takes in all of the city limits west of Thirteenth street and as far north as and including Hamilton street. This tract includes the thinly settled portion of our city and a very large proportion of the laboring men who would probably be employed in the construction of the building and the arrangement of the grounds, etc., while the mile and a half limit from the main body of the Miller park site still falls short of the northern part of the most northern of the improved additions to the city, Kountze place, which, even if included, would still embrace no laboring men.</p>
<p>It has been estimated that it will take 500 men one year to properly prepare the ground and erect the buildings incidental to the exposition. This means a payment to the laborers of at least $300,000, two-thirds of whom (a small estimate) by paying car fare would be assessed for the benefit of the street car companies $10,000. The well-known preferences of the Street Railway company can be easily understood, but the interests of the laboring classes and the Street Railway company in this instance are not identical. The extra labor employed in the extension of the street railway line will be counterbalanced one hundred fold by the difference in the character of the buildings erected for hotel purposes, etc., if an interior site is chosen.</p>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">A Laborer's View.</head>
<p>Omaha, Jan. 21.&#8212;To the Editor of the World-Herald: Being a workingman, and seeing the location of the Trans-Mississippi exposition fair ground from a workingman's standpoint, I would, for one, very much like to see the grounds located right in or as near the city as possible. It was demonstrated to the entire satisfaction of everybody concerned in building the new state fair grounds that it is not practical to board and live in the city with the place of work so far off. But you say, "We will have one or two car lines running right up to the fair grounds gate this time." True, I'll admit, but when it comes to moving thousands of people every morning and evening to and from one point at so great a distance as most of the proposed sites are located, I am positive it will create delays and inconveniences without end. And I would like to say that hanging on to the outside of an overloaded street car four or five miles after working hard all day is not very desirable. For this reason I believe locating the fair at some place close at hand would confer a great favor on all laboring men of Omaha. GUS PETERSON</p></div2>
    
<div2 type="article"><p>OMAHA, Jan. 22.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: The undersigned most respectfully beg to call the attention of all the citizens of Omaha to the only real, plausible, economical and advantageous site of all for the holding of the coming Transmississippi and International Exposition. First we wish to state plainly which site we are championing, so there will be no misunderstanding, and will, without any attempt at flowery oratory, deal entirely with facts regarding our site and point out a few positive objections to the other proposed sites which have not been brought out by their advocates. To our mind the location known as the "Elmwood park site," which includes 204 3/4 acres in the park, also 160 acres adjoining owned by the Omaha Fair and Speed association, is the only place in which all of our citizens should be interested and benefited alike from the permanent improvements which would necessarily have to be put on the ground, but especially the citizens (about 3,000 in number) who have subscribed to stock or donated cash for the upbuilding of the fair grounds and maintenance of same.</p>    
<p>We see by an article written by our mutual friend, Robert Purvis, that he takes occasion to score Omaha as having made "several grievous mistakes in locating public institutions," and especially so in locating the state fair. We would like to ask "Robert" where he was at the time these locations were settled upon and why he did not lend us his valuable counsel in locating our public institutions. The fact of the matter is our site is not too far from the city of Omaha and is seven-eights of a mile nearer the postoffice than other sites suggested in the north part of the city. We venture the suggestion that the 5,000 residents spoken of by Robert who did not attend the fair would not have attended had it been located at Sixteenth and Farnam streets. Assuming, as he says, that the fort was located in Sarpy county, the state fair grounds near Elkhorn and the Exposition near Florence, and that we built up solid between these points, we would have not only a city of magnificent distances, but one of between 350,000 to 500,000 inhabitants as against 140,000. Using your hammer to knock public institutions in a city is bad for the general welfare of said city, and if all other sites contained sufficient area, which was owned by the city of Omaha, everything else being equal, we should not oppose them for a moment. One of the great features of the Elmwood park site is that all of the buildings that are to be erected and all of the permanent improvements that are to be placed upon said grounds will be put upon grounds belonging to all of the citizens of Omaha and therefore will benefit each one of us alike, and not any one or two individuals.</p>
<p>Another strong feature which should be considered well by the Board of Directors of the exposition is the fact that the Elmwood park site and fair grounds has already expended upon it $320,000 over and above the amount expended on any one of the other sites mentioned. In other words, the Elmwood park site offers as an inducement to locate the Exposition on its grounds $320,000 as a subscription to the fund. The site in itself is high and sightly. There is no possible seepage from the surrounding country that can possibly touch this area of ground, as there is in other sights offered. An adequate and inexhaustible water supply that is practically built, supplied and operated by Providence, and not by any worldly water works company, is certainly a very desirable feature. The gravel bed overlaying bed rock, which can be reached at an average depth of 100 feet, is a veritable underground river, much more reliable than the muddy Missouri, the water therein being of the purest and clearest nature. By having an independent water plant whose duty extends no further than supplying the wants of the exposition company would certainly be more preferable than a plant that has to supply both city and Exposition grounds. The danger of broken mains and other mishaps would be reduced to a minimum.</p>
<p>The sewerage of these grounds is one of nature's work; no distance to travel to find facilities to care for the same; no extensive provision to be made for outside surface drainage, nature having also provided for that. The entire tract is covered with grass. The street car facilities, while not of the best, will be compelled to be made adequate for all wants if the Exposition is located at Elmwood park. The railroad facilities at the present time are adequate for all wants and are now laid directly to the grounds, four different lines of roads making this point. Ample provision has been made for suitable tracts of land for showing in an intelligent way all matters pertaining to agriculture, such as irrigation, etc. The grounds are reached by four of our leading thoroughfares from the city due west, in which direction "Empire takes its way." We have always advocated, ever since the Exposition theory was advanced, a point which was brought out by our friend and citizen, R. W. Richardson. That is, the perpetuation of the Exposition theory for an indefinite length of time after the time allotted for the holding of the Transmississippi and International Exposition had expired. Many, if not all, of the buildings put up by the transmississippi states would be erected with a view to permanency and there is not a state scarcely in the transmississippi country but that would be more than pleased to perpetuate and maintain, at their own expense, a building showing their wonderful resources and possibilities, and, if they did not desire to stand that expense themselves, it would be money in Omaha's pocket to stand it for them. People traveling across the continent would be sure to stop over in Omaha from one or two or three days if a permanent Exposition of this kind was held in our city.</p>
<p>If we were in our friend Richardson's place, however, we would not say much about the site that is, as he claims, "hidden away in the valley of the Little Papio," as this site is nearly a mile nearer the postoffice than the one he is in favor of. We would also like to ask our mutual friend Richardson what portion of the 500 acres he is advocating belongs to the city of Omaha and whether or not his argument against the Hanscom park site does not equally apply to the Miller park site. Not one of the proposed sites states plainly what portion of their ground belongs to the city and what portion to the various individuals. Riverview park has only sixty-five acres belonging to the city; Miller park has only seventy-eight acres belonging to the city; Hanscom park has only eight acres, which belongs to the county. East Omaha belongs entirely to individuals. Elmwood park has 370 acres and all belongs to the city and 3,000 of our most liberal and public-spirited citizens.</p>
    <p>The Hanscom park site has advantages, but also disadvantages. We venture to say that the citizens residing on the west and northwest side of Hanscom park have not been consulted in this matter, and if they have and have given their consent, have not considered the undesirable outside inhabitants that an exposition of this kind is sure to attract, such as miniature Ferris wheels, merry-go-grounds (with attendant discordant stands and wild west shows, all of which must <choice><sic>necesarily</sic><corr>necessarily</corr></choice> be located very near if not quite in their back yards. The noise and din which would surely be made by these outside inhabitants would make life most miserable from early morning until late night for six months of the year at least.</p>

<pb n="45" xml:id="TMISB02-045"/> 



<p>Riverview park, while it has some pretty features, (after you get to it), should not be considered because it has but one line of railroad running to it, and no street car facilities as yet completed to the grounds, and besides not being large enough to accommodate the buildings on ground that belongs solely and only to the city. The North Omaha sites suggested, if adopted, would be a detriment to the best business interest of the city, owning to the fact that many citizens from the east would be transported across the East Omaha bridge in the morning to the Exposition grounds and out in the evening. A large percentage of our patronage must come from the east. Omaha would never see a large number of them. The seepage and drainage from the hills surrounding this site settle here, and the present lake in Miller park is made by a stoppage of the sewer, which, if opened up, would show said lake to be a little ravine in reality. The above is substantiated by a thoroughly competent engineer.</p>
<p>Taking all things into consideration, we cannot see as there is but one location for the Exposition, and in this conclusion we voice the sentiments of thousands of citizens who have not electioneered for the site, believing that when the true and natural merits of Elmwood park were brought to the attention of those who were to be selected for this purpose that this site would stand preeminently above all others that might be offered.</p>

<div2 type="article"><dateline>THE EVENING BEE: SATURDAY,<lb/>JANUARY 23, 1897.</dateline>
    <head type="sub">LOCATING THE EXPOSITION.</head>    
<p>OMAHA, Jan. 22.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: I was amused at reading the two communications in The Bee of last evening&#8212;one from Mr. Crum and the other from Attorney Richardson, both favoring Miller park and opposing Hanscom park, and from diametrically different standpoints. Mr. Crum objects to the Hanscom park site for the reason that it would be "altogether too wearing on the pedestrian and an extra, unnecessary and unreasonable tax on the patience and muscle of the poor chair wheeler." Attorney Richardson advocates the "Miller park site with its 500 or more beautiful acres" as the only suitable location for the exposition.</p>
<p>In the name of common sense what does the exposition want with "500 or more beautiful acres?" Is it going into the corn raising business, with corn at 10 cents a bushel, or does it propose to establish a grazing or stock ranch? If it were necessary to have so large a tract of land scatter the exposition buildings all over the same, would it not be far more tough on the "poor chair wheeler" and 'more wearing on the pedestrian" than if only 150 acres centrally located were improved? Would it not be far better to improve and beautify 150 acres, or possibly 100 acres, near the center of the city than to expand the money of the exposition in attempting to improve "500 or more beautiful acres" extending from the north line of the old government reservation to the south line of Florence? It is true that Florence is a beautiful city, and if it has not the waterways of its ancient namesake, it has within its corporate limits the Omaha water works. It is also true that the surroundings of Florence represent many hundred "beautiful acres," but the distance to these beautiful acres, like the distance to the beautiful acres surrounding Bellevue, is altogether too great for the majority of the residents of Omaha, Council Bluffs and South Omaha, and far too remote from the cities named for visitors who may desire to see and know something of these cities as well as see the wonders of the exposition. It is an undoubted fact that not one in a hundred of the citizens of Omaha or South Omaha have seen the extensive improvements and beautiful grounds comprising the government reservation at Bellevue. It is also a fact that cannot be fairly questioned or disputed that there is not one in a hundred of the people of Omaha or South Omaha who have not visited Hanscom park many times. What is true of near and remote locations in the past will be true of the exposition in the future. A fair consideration of the advantages of all the proposed sites for the exposition will demonstrate the correctness of the contention of the advocates of the Hanscom park location that for accessibility, elevation, water supply, drainage and sewerage, and the preservation for the future use of the public of the permanent and desirable buildings, it stands without an equal or a rival. A great deal has been said and done in the past in favor of the Miller park site, but notwithstanding this, the Hanscom park site has rapidly been growing in public favor.</p>
<p>Permit me briefly to enumerate the special advantages of the Hanscom park site:</p>
<p>The Hanscom park site is the most central of all the locations proposed. This is demonstrated by a reference to the maps of the city. No unbiased person will question the great advantage of a central location. The direct result of a central location would be to double the gate receipts, largely increase the street railway traffic and greatly benefit the business interests of our city. The nearest possible location to the business center of the city should be favored by every one having the interest of the city at heart and desiring to see the exposition a complete success. As recently stated by one of our business men, the best location would be Farnam and Sixteenth streets, but, as the adjacent improvements are of such a character as to render the selection of this location impossible, the next suitable and nearest location should be selected. If the maps of the city are examined it will be observed that if a line is drawn midway between the Hanscom park and Miller park locations it will cross the city east and west at a point some distance north of Prospect Hill cemetery and about in the vicinity of Lake street. If a two-mile circle is drawn from the proposed entrance to the Hanscom park site it will include within its limits the northern portion of South Omaha and also the southeastern portion of the city, including Mr. Kountze's residence and Brownell hall. It will also include the entire business portion of the city. It will also include Dundee and Walnut Hill in the northwest portion of the city, and also include the greatest portion of the residence property in the northern part of the city south of Lake street. If a two-mile circle is drawn from the proposed entrance of the Miller park site it will extend almost to the northern boundary line of the city of Florence, would include Cut-Off lake and would extend southward a sufficient distance to take in Kountze Place. The Hanscom park two-mile circle would include only about one-tenth of the population of the city. The Hanscom park site could most easily be reached by five-sixths of the population of the cities of Omaha and South Omaha, while the Miller park site could perhaps be most easily reached by one-sixth of the population. It is fair to estimate that the great bulk of the visitors to the exposition, if they are to stop in the city, will locate near the central portion of the city, and, therefore, could reach the Hanscom park site far more easily and quickly than they could reach the Miller park site.</p>
<p>Mr. Crum urges as a reason for favoring Miller park that the Fremont, Elkhorn &amp; Missouri Valley railway and the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha railroad, as well as the Belt Line railway, would all bring their trains into the exposition grounds. This may seem to Mr. Crum a thing greatly to be desired. As I view the matter, it would be a great misfortune to have visitors taken by the railway trains directly to and from the exposition grounds. It is manifestly for the benefit of Omaha and the business interests of the city, as well as for the street railway company, that visitors should reach the exposition grounds from some part of the city of Omaha rather than by railway trains coming into or passing through the city.</p>
<p>Mr. Crum claims that there is but one line of street railway leading to the Hanscom park site. In this he is mistaken. The Sixteenth and Leavenworth street line, which is the most completely equipped double-track line in the city, would take passengers to both the east entrance at the northwest corner of Hanscom park and the south entrance on Center street. The double track Farnam street line has a double track connection with the Leavenworth street line on Twenty-eighth street. With an extension of two or three blocks southward from Farnam street on Thirty-fifth street the main north entrance of the Hanscom park site would also be reached. During the rush hours it would be sufficient to merely run two or three trains to the Fifteenth or Sixteenth street switches, the same being sufficiently near to the hotels and centrally located boarding houses, thereby enabling the cars to at once return to the Exposition grounds. The trips could be made in less than one-third of the time that would be required to go to the Miller park site.</p>
<p>It must be admitted by every one that the Hanscom park site is the most elevated as well as the most centrally located. When it is considered that the exposition will be held during the hot summer months, a slightly elevated location is greatly to be desired. The view from the Hanscom park site is extended and beautiful in every direction.</p>
<p>While it is true that the Hanscom park site is not as near the water works as the Miller park site, it is not true that the Hanscom park site has not an adequate and sufficient water supply. The fact is that along Poppleton avenue, extending through the center of the grounds, is a large twenty-four-inch main, with fire hydrants at short distances apart. A water main also extends along Center street with fire hydrants. As a result, sufficient water supply and ample fire protection can be secured.</p>
<p>An examination of the records in the office of the city engineer will demonstrate that the Hanscom park site has drainage and equalled by any other proposed location. A large sewer main exists within a short distance of the north line of the Hanscom park site and several pipe lines extend up to and through the grounds offered to the exposition. No sewer whatever exists in Miller park. Its so-called beautiful lake is made from water contaminated with sewage, and unless a large expenditure of from $50,000 to $100,000 is made for the construction of sewer lines the proposed "beautiful lake" would be a disease-breeding pestilence.</p>
<p>Another strong point in favor of the Hanscom park location is the permanent redemption of the unsightly ravine which extends north and south through the central portion of the city, crossing Farnam near Thirty-first street. As a part of the plan for locating the exposition near Hanscom park, it is proposed to convert the unsightly ravine referred to into a beautiful park and boulevard, which for all future time, like Hanscom park, would be more generally used and enjoyed than any other park or boulevard in the city. As the result of turning this present eyesore into a beauty spot in the very heart of the city, some of the desirable buildings of the exposition could be permanently located and would remain after the exposition for the use and enjoyment of the people. Another advantage by taking a portion of the county farm would be that a number of permanently constructed buildings could also remain for future public use.</p>
<p>I respectfully submit that the advantages in favor of the Hanscom park site far exceed and outweigh any advantage that can possibly exist in favor of any other location.</p>

    <head type="main">SITE IS NOT YET SETTLED</head>
<head type="sub">Directors Postpone Further Action to Await the Legislative Appropriation.</head>
<head type="sub">ENGINEERS' REPORT REMAINS UNOPENED</head>
<head type="sub">Friends of the Different Locations Were Out in Force at the Directors' Meeting, but Were Unable to Force the Issue.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition held a special meeting yesterday afternoon to receive the report of the expert engineers employed to examine the five sites tendered as locations for the Exposition, and report on the most valuable site for Exposition purposes. Every member of the board was present, with the exception of General C. F. Manderson. The session was short but decidedly animated, although nothing was done in the way of opening the report of the engineers, or voting upon a site, all action in this direction being postponed for two weeks.</p>    
<p>The meeting was held in the new quarters of the Exposition, in the Paxton block. The room where the directors will hold all their meetings is barely large enough for all the directors to be seated, consequently the lobby was compelled to occupy the hall adjoining the room. The lobby was very numerous, the supporters of all the sites being present in force. The hall and doorways were crowded and every point of vantage was filled.</p>    
<p>After the usual preliminaries, the business of the meeting opened with the introduction of a resolution by G. M. Hitchcock providing that after reading and discussing the report of the engineers, further consideration of the report and the vote upon a site be postponed until after the legislature of Nebraska has acted upon the bill now pending, which provides for a state appropriation. In explaining the resolution, Mr. Hitchcock said that unless the legislature of Nebraska makes a liberal appropriation there is no use in attempting to carry on the Exposition, as the legislature of other states would refuse to support an exposition in Nebraska that was not supported by the legislature of that state. For this reason Mr. Hitchcock said he was opposed to taking any further action until it is determined what the legislature will do.</p></div3>

<pb n="46" xml:id="TMISB02-046"/> 

<div3>
<head type="sub">DISCUSSION OF RESOLUTION.</head>
<p>This resolution formed the subject of an animated discussion in which nearly every director took part. The resolution was opposed by several of the directors on the ground that no harm would result from choosing a site, and that it would look more businesslike to go ahead as far as possible without incurring large expense. These directors were in favor of opening the report of the engineers and voting at once upon the location. This course was warmly supported by J. C. Wharton, Dr. E. W. Lee, C. E. Yost, Alvin Saunders, J. L. Webster and others.</p>
<p>The resolution was supported by all the members of the executive committee, and a large number of others. C. S. Montgomery said it would be an insult to the people of the community to open the reports and vote upon a site without allowing the report of the engineers to be made public and give the citizens an opportunity to be heard in the matter.</p>
<p>Herman Kountze said the resolution should be adopted, but it should first be amended to provide that the report should not be opened at this time. In support of this Mr. Kountze made a short but earnest talk which had a very perceptible effect.</p>
<p>G. H. Payne demanded that the report should be opened and made public some time before a vote is taken, that members of the board, as well as the general public, might have an opportunity of learning what the report contains.</p>
<p>This idea did not meet with favor and the amendment was adopted.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">GOES OVER FOR TWO WEEKS.</head>
<p>J. L. Webster then offered a substitute providing that the special committee appointed to employ engineers to examine the sites be given two weeks longer in which to report. After a brief discussion the substitute was adopted.</p>
<p>C. S. Montgomery, of the special committee of lawyers appointed to investigate the legal right of the city of Omaha and Douglas county to make appropriations for the support of the Exposition, reported that the authorities of the city or county have no such power. He said it would be necessary for the legislature to enact laws giving the city and county such power before such action could be taken.</p>
<p>The executive committee reported that it had not yet taken any action upon the resolution of Director Youngs regarding the employment of Douglas county labor on the Exposition, and asked that it be given further time. The request was granted and the board then adjourned for two weeks.</p></div3></div2>

<head type="sub">Report of the Engineers on the Various Plots Considered to Remain Closely Sealed.</head>
<head type="sub">Decision Will Not Be Known Until the State Legislature Acts on the Bill for Appropriation Asked.</head>
    <div3>
<p>No one will know for two weeks in what part of the city the exposition will be held. It was expected that the matter would be settled yesterday afternoon at the meeting of the board of directors, which was held for the first time in the room at headquarters. The public was admitted as far as space would allow and the doors left open so that those who crowded the hall might witness the proceedings.</p>    
<p>The question of selecting the site had been discussed at a meeting of the executive committee that was held at noon, and the members of the committee had come unanimously to the agreement that it would be better to defer a choice until action should be taken by the legislature. They therefore prepared a resolution which was offered as soon as the meeting of the directory opened. This was to the effect that the report of the experts who had been inspecting the site be opened and read, but that the selection of a site by a vote of the directory be deferred until after action was taken by the legislature.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">TO AWAIT STATE APPROVAL.</head>
<p>It was suggested that the choice of a site would further bind the association to go ahead with expensive preparations for the exposition, and it was urged that this was not advisable until it was known what the legislature would do, for unless the appropriation should approximately be what was asked the exposition could not be <choice><sic>carreid</sic><corr>carried</corr></choice> out. In short it was contended that no step of so important a character as this should be taken until the approval of the state, through the legislature, had been given to the scheme. This was set forth by Manager Hitchcock of the department of promotion and he was followed in support of the resolution by Dudley Smith, J. H. Evans, Z. T. Lindsey, Mr Bruce, E. Rosewater, C. S. Montgomery, G. H. Payne, I. W. Carpenter and Herman Kountze.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">OPPOSE FURTHER DELAY.</head>
<p>Remarks opposing the resolution were made by John H. Hussie, J. C. Wharton, Dr. Lee, John L. Webster and Alvin Saunders. These were of the opinion that it would be against the interests of the exposition to delay further the selection of a site. To select one would show to all the world that the association was going ahead as fast as it could and would cause the legislature of Nebraska and of all the western states to vote appropriations more freely.</p>
<p>Many of those who were opposed to the resolution were opposed only to that part which provided that the findings of the engineers should be read. They held that if no action was to be taken the report should not be read for then it would only be the means of sowing discord and wrangling from one end of the town to the other and intensifying and prolonging the controversy, already spirited enough, over the site question.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">REPORT REMAINS SEALED.</head>
<p>Mr. Kountze moved to amend the resolution to the effect that the report of the engineers should remain sealed until time for definite action arrived, and this amendment was carried, but finally Mr. Webster moved a substitute to the effect that the special committee to which the propositions for site were referred be given two weeks longer in which to report, and this prevailed by a large majority.</p>
<p>Other business was then taken up. Mr. Montgomery, for the special committee named to report on the powers of the city and county to make appropriations or donations, reported that it had no such power and recommended that a bill be passed by the legislature conferring it upon it.</p>
<p>The executive committee asked and was granted more time in which to report on the labor resolution referred to it at the last meeting of the directory.</p>
<p>Messrs. Alexander and Schrader, the inspecting engineers, left for Chicago last evening.</p></div3></div2>

    <head type="main">RULES TO GOVERN EXHIBITS</head>
<head type="sub">AN INTERNATIONAL JURY OF AWARDS</head>
<head type="sub">Rules Set Out the Price for Space to Exhibitors, and Mention the Character of the Awards to Be Made.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The Departments of Exhibits and Concessions of the exposition have issued a blank which all prospective exhibitors at the exposition must use in making their applications for space for either exhibits or concessions. These will be mailed at once to manufacturers and inventors all over the world, being in the nature of an invitation to exhibit as well as an application blank.</p>
<p>This form is 22x17 inches in size, and is printed in attractive form. Under a tastily arranged heading, stating briefly the name of the exposition and the names of the officers and heads of departments, is a brief summary of the plan and scope of the exposition, with a concise statement of some of the regulations which will govern exhibitors and concessionaires. In this it is stated that charge for space will be made on the following basis: In buildings, floor space, $1 per square foot; wall space <choice><sic>.</sic><corr>,</corr></choice> 50 cents per square foot; and grounds, all space 50 cents per square foot. It is also stated that governments and large exhibitors, as well as exhibitors operating processes of manufacture, will be given special advantages.</p>
<p>The rules which will govern exhibitors and concessionaires are printed on the back of the application. There are forty-eight of these rules and they are very complete, having been taken from the best rules prepared for the government of other expositions in all parts of the world. They provide explicit directions for the shipment of exhibits and for the installing of the same, as well as the rules which will govern exhibitors during the progress of the exposition.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">CLASSIFYING THE EXHIBITS</head>
<p>For the purpose of classifying exhibits the following six heads are provided, with the provision that the Jury of Awards shall classify all exhibits not therein mentioned. These classifications are as follows:</p>
<p>A&#8212;Agriculture, food and its accessories, forestry and forest products, irrigation, its modern system and appliances, agricultural machinery, horticulture, viticulture, apiary products, pomology, fish and fisheries, fish products and apparatus for fishing, beet root industry of all description.</p>
<p>B&#8212;Mechanical arts, mines, mining, metallurgy transportation, railways, vessels, cycles, vehicles, electricity and electrical appliances.</p>
<p>C&#8212;Manufacturers in general, liberal arts education, engineering, public works, constructive architecture, music and drama, ethnology, archaeology, progress of labor and inventions.</p>
<p>D&#8212;Fine arts, painting, sculpture, architecture and decoration.</p>
<p>E&#8212;Woman's work.</p>
<p>F&#8212;Isolated and collective exhibits.</p>
<p>The rules provide for an international jury of awards to pass upon the merits of the exhibits, and awards are provided for as follows:</p>
<lg>
    <l>1. Special diploma of honor.</l>
    <l>2. Diploma for gold medal.</l>
    <l>3. Diploma for silver medal.</l>
    <l>4. Diploma for bronze medal.</l>
    <l>5. Diploma for honorable mention.</l>
</lg>
<p>Every diploma for medal will be accompanied by an official medal of bronze, prepared by act of congress at the United States mint. In addition to the above awards, special prizes consisting of six gold trophies, six silver cups, and six gold medals, will be offered to competitors in each of the following classes:</p>
<p>One gold trophy, one silver cup and one gold medal, as first, second and third prize, for best display of working irrigating system.</p>
<p>One gold trophy, one silver cup and one gold medal, as first, second and third prize, for best display illustrating the process of the manufacture of beet root sugar.</p>
<p>Old gold trophy, one silver cup and one gold medal, as first, second and third prize, for best display of manufacturing plan in operation, as well as two more lots of similar prizes for other high-class exhibits, to be designed by the exposition authorities.</p>
<p>The rules also contain the following clause:</p>
<p>"In giving the special prizes, preference will be given to those inventions proving the most suitable to the requirements of the west. All awards will be apportioned on the reports of the international juries to every exhibitor whose contributions are pronounced to be of incontestable superiority. The jury work will be completed at least one month prior to the close of the exposition, so as to give successful exhibitors the opportunity to advertise their awards in the exposition."</p></div3></div2>

<head type="sub">WHAT THE WEST IS DOING FOR THE COMING EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">California Urged to Come to the Front with a Suitable Appropriation for Exhibits&#8212;A Bill Now Before the Legislature.</head>
<p>In every part of California the greatest interest is felt in a bill now pending in the Legislature for the appropriation of $70,000, to be used in making a creditable State display at the coming Transmississippi and International Exposition<choice><sic>.</sic><corr>,</corr></choice> to be held at Omaha next year, from June to November. The exposition is intended to exhibit particularly the products, resources. industries and civilization of the States and Territories west of the Mississippi River, embracing two-thirds of the era. one-third of the population and one-half the wealth of the United States, and, incidentally, the products, resources and industries of the other States lying east of the Mississippi River, and of foreign countries.</p>
<p>The Transmississippi and International Exposition is a corporation organized under the laws of Nebraska, with an authorized capital stock of

<pb n="47" xml:id="TMISB02-047"/> 


    
$1,000,000. The articles of incorporation require a board of fifty directors, by whom the enterprise will be conducted. It is also provided that there shall be a vice-president for the exposition in each of the Transmississippi States and Territories, who will have a share in the management and direction of the interests of the exposition; each vice-president to have particularly under his charge the interests and representation of his own State.</p>
<p>Of the capital stock of the exposition company there has already been subscribed $405,200. There are over sixty-three hundred stockholders, most of whom are residents of Nebraska, although five or six other States are also represented on the list. Congress, at its last session, appropriated $200,000 for a national exhibit, and an amended bill calling for an appropriation of $300,000 has already been prepared and introduced at the present session.</p>
<p>At its last session the Iowa Legislature made a preliminary appropriation of $10,000, but the development of the exposition project since that time has given the enterprise an altogether different standing, and at the special session of the Legislature of that State, which convened January 19, a supplemental bill was introduced for the purpose of increasing the appropriation of Iowa for the exposition to $75,000.</p>
<p>Nebraska has risen to the occasion in noble fashion, for the Legislature is to be asked to appropriate $300,000, with a local subsidy of $200,000 by Douglas county and the city of Omaha.</p>
<p>The State of Louisiana, at its session closing July 9, 1896, passed a concurrent resolution instructing the State Board of Agriculture to arrange for and provide fitting, ample and adequate representation of the State at the exposition, and pledging the State to pay the expenses thereof.</p>
<p>Utah, Wyoming and Colorado have pledged their States to large and full representation, and it is practically assured that twenty, at least, of the twenty-four States and Territories will be fittingly and largely represented.</p>
<p>States east of the Mississippi River, and foreign countries and nations, have been invited and requested to participate to an unlimited extent, and every facility will be granted for their exhibits.</p>
<p>It is the general feeling throughout the State that California should be well to the front in taking advantage of this opportunity to advertise its resources, products and capabilities to the world. It is not a matter for Southern California alone to take up, any more than for the north, but the whole State must combine its resources and pull well together if the Golden State is to take its proper position among its peers in the great West.</p>
<p>Hon. George W. Parsons was the delegate from the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce to the Commercial Congress last year, and in his hand has been put the matter of arranging for a suitable appropriation. After careful consideration and many consultations with Superintendent Frank Wiggins of the Chamber of Commerce, a man of national experience in expositions, Mr. Parsons drafted the bill for the appropriation, which is now in the hands of Senator Robert M. Bulla.</p>
<p>When the legislators met in Los Angeles Mr. Parsons placed the whole matter before them, and all gave it hearty <choice><sic>indorsement</sic><corr>endorsement</corr></choice> and approval. It is felt that the grand State of California cannot afford to be niggardly in this appropriation. Every item of expense has been carefully worked out by Mr. Parsons and Mr. Wiggins, and the thing cannot be handsomely done for less. According to the closest calculation, it will take at least $2000 to complete the necessary preliminary work. The building and grounds will cost $25,000; the freight, $2000; the fixtures, $2000; collection of a suitable exhibit, $3000, its installment at Omaha, $5000; its maintenance there for five months, $10,000; suitable decorations, $1000; lights, $1000; miscellaneous printing, $2000; pamphlets, $7000; taking down and packing the exhibits, $1000, and returning them to California, $1000.</p>
<p>Other Western States have come to the front with heavy appropriations, and the first suggestion that California should devote $75,000 to making a proper showing at this exhibition of western products and resources has <note>article ends abruptly</note></p></div2>

<head type="sub">IMPORTANT EXPOSITION PRELIMINARIES</head>
<head type="sub">Seeks to Have Governments of the World Ready to Receive Their Subjects at Omaha in 1898.</head>
<p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 25.&#8212;(Special telegram.)&#8212;Representative Mercer, with an eye to the success of the Transmississippi Exposition, has commenced to project the coming exposition among the representatives of foreign countries having ambassadors, ministers plenipotentiary, consuls general, diplomatic agents and attaches represented at the national capital, with a view of inducing these countries to locate in Omaha at an early date as possible resident consuls, in order that foreign governments may be in a position, through their accredited representatives, to lend advice to those desiring to make exhibits. This movement is already most promising. Representatives of Mexico, Central and South American states and several Europeans countries have been seen by Mr. Mercer, with decided encouragement. The people of Atlanta tried the same plan, but found it necessary to send an accredited representative into the South American countries in order to secure exhibits from those states. The mission of the Atlanta representative resulted most satisfactorily and he secured exhibits that could not otherwise have been had. While representatives of foreign governments may take an active interest in expositions of this character, the results so far as exhibits are concerned, do not turn out as satisfactorily as might be wished for. Mr. Mercer stated, however, that he was cordially received at the several legations and he believed good would come from the efforts made to locate resident consuls in Omaha at least six months before the exposition opens.</p></div2>

<p>President Wattles of the exposition association announces that a resolution will be introduced into the Nebraska senate today, authorizing the governor of the state to announce by proclamation the holding of the exposition, and inviting the people of other states to take part. It will also authorize the governor to deliver to the secretary of state of the United States invitations to foreign countries to participate. These invitations, it is contemplated, will be finally delivered through the diplomatic agents abroad.</p>
<p>In President Wattles' mail Tuesday morning was a letter from Congressman Mercer, stating that he was paying constant attention to the amended exposition bill, and would get it called up as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It is stated by the department of exhibits that G. W. Sues has arranged to take charge of a section in which various patents and inventions will be shown in motion.</p>
<p>The correspondence of the department of exhibits is beginning to show something of the interest that is being taken in the exposition by the people of other states. A large agricultural machinery manufacturing company of Illinois has written with regard to an extensive exhibit which it intends to make. It asks whether the managers would prefer that it take space in one of the buildings or erect a pavilion of its own. This is a point which the manufacturers will themselves probably be left to decide. If the pavilion is put up it will be at an expense of several thousand dollars.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent of the brewers of Milwaukee has written asking for full particulars as to the putting up of a plant designed to show all the processes of brewing in operation. His inquiry is chiefly with regard to power. He says that if it is at all practicable to have an exhibit of this kind he is anxious to enter it.</p>
<p>The local merchants, in their correspondence, are giving a good deal of aid to the department of exhibits, as to other departments. They are calling the attention of the large houses and manufacturers from whom they buy to the exposition, and are already getting replies that indicate business. One merchant says that he has been told by one of the concerns with which he trades that it expects to have an exhibit here that will cost at least $6,000, and this merchant has asked for 300 application blanks to send out in his mail.</p>
<p>The department of promotion is urging all the merchants, big and little, to aid it in scattering the literature that has been prepared, with a view to bringing about favorable action by the various state legislatures. It asks that the merchants call for these circulars.</p>
<p>Finishing touches are being put on the work of fitting up the rooms in the Paxton block, into which the departments of the exposition have recently moved.</p>
<p>The mail of the association has now reached such proportions that one carrier cannot handle it, and arrangements have been made for special mail boxes in the corridor adjoining the rooms&#8212;one box for first-class and another for the inferior mail matter.</p></div2>

<p>Whereas, The congress of the United States did, by an act approved by the president June 10, 1896, pledge the government to participate in a Trans-Mississippi and International exposition, to be held at Omaha, Neb., between June 1 and November 1, 1898, and did by said act grant to said exposition all the rights and privileges heretofore granted to <choice><sic>internationaal</sic><corr>international</corr></choice> expositions, therefore be it</p>

<head type="sub">VIEWS OF MEMBERS OF THE DIRECTORY</head>
<head type="sub">Discussion Upon the Subject of Keeping from the Public the Report of the Experts Who Viewed the Proposed Sites.</head>
    <div3>
<p>Public interest continues to center in the question of where the Board of Directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition association will locate the great show that will be held in this city during the summer of 1898. Expert engineers were brought from Chicago for the purpose of viewing the five sites that have been proposed. These men looked over the grounds and reduced their findings to writing, the same, it is said, containing a statement with definite recommendation of one of the proposed locations. This report, sealed, was handed in to a committee last Saturday and its consideration was postponed for two weeks. Since the date of the meeting there has been an animated discussion over the question of the advisability of making the report public, that directors and subscribers to exposition stock might be informed of the nature of the contents. In order to learn the sentiment prevailing among the directors upon this subject, The Bee has secured the following interviews:</p>

<pb n="48" xml:id="TMISB02-048"/> 

<p>President Wattles&#8212;I am opposed to opening the report and making it public in advance of the meeting at which it is to be discussed and voted upon. To do so would be to stir up strife in the community and give an opportunity for the advocates of the sites which are not recommended to try all kinds of schemes to overcome the report. These engineers were employed as experts to pass upon the engineering questions involved and unless their report is glaringly unfair upon its face I am in favor of following their recommendation.</p>
<p>Z. T. Lindsey&#8212;I believe that the idea of keeping the report of the engineers a secret was a mistake. The people who have subscribed stock have a right to know what we are doing. Up to this time nothing has been concealed. The reporters for the daily papers have been admitted to all the meetings of the executive committee, and I can see no reason why, at this late day, a matter of this kind should be concealed. I think that the report of the experts should have been published at once.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WOULD ADMIT DISCUSSION.</head>
<p>A. L. Reed&#8212;I believe that it would be best to open the report of the engineers. The directors would then have an opportunity to investigate the report and discuss it before they were called upon to decide the question. Furthermore, it would give an opportunity to the public to discuss the report. I should also advocate the opening of the columns of the press to the people after the report has been made public. Let the people talk it over and say what they think of the report. All of us are greenhorns on the matter of exposition sites, and we can afford to discuss this report pretty thoroughly before deciding the matter. There is none of us who cannot learn something about the matter by a full and free discussion of it. I should say that the report should be made public at least one week before the question is to be finally decided.</p>
<p>F. P. Kirkendall&#8212;I certainly believe that the committee took the right course. I think that we could do nothing else than to support the resolution as good policy under the circumstances.</p>
<p>E. E. Bruce&#8212;I have nothing to say. The directors have taken this action, and as a director and citizen I will support them.</p>
<p>G. M. Hitchcock&#8212;I do not think that any harm and considerable good might have been done by making the report of the experts public. If the report is a reasonable one, I should consider that I was in great measure bound to vote for a site in line with its recommendations.</p>
<p>Herman Kountze&#8212;I do not wish to discuss the matter at this time. I entirely approve of the action of the committee in postponing the opening of the engineers' report.</p>
<p>H. A. Thompson&#8212;We should wait at least a week after opening the report in order to give the directors time to digest the recommendation of the engineers. The directors doubtless have a fair knowledge of the several sites, but none of them are engineers and have no technical knowledge on the availability of the sites from an engineering standpoint, therefore they should be guided largely by the report, but they should be given time to consider the report in all its bearings.</p>
<p>John A. Johnson&#8212;I think the report should have been published. I do not think it was ever contemplated by the original resolution that the report should be opened and voted on at the same meeting. The report should have been made public when it was received and then the directors could have had an opportunity to look up any questions raised in the report and vote intelligently on them.</p>
<p>C. S. Montgomery&#8212;It is an outrage that the report of the engineers should be kept from the public, and that the Board of Directors should be compelled to decide upon a location at once without having time to consider that report. If I were not on the board I would say that the whole thing indicated that the advocates of the favored site, whichever it may be, were afraid to have it considered. At any rate the report should have been given to the directors in order that they might have had a week or more to investigate its recommendations before deciding on a site. I certainly shall make a fight in the meeting two weeks hence if any attempt is made to force the board to vote on a site immediately after the report is opened. I will do this even if my favored site is the one recommended. I do not think that the recommendations of the experts were ever intended to settle the site, but were simply for the purpose of assisting the board in making the selection.</p>
<p>W. A. Paxton, Sr.&#8212;I believe that the action of the last meeting was proper. I will vote in line with the recommendations of the experts, whether they favor my first, second or third choice of site or not. I think that the experts were brought here for the sole purpose of choosing the location.</p></div3> 
    <div3>
<head type="sub">ENDORSES THE EDITORIAL.</head>
<p>Daniel Farrell, Jr.&#8212;I heartily endorse The Bee's editorial urging the publication of the engineers' report at this time. It reflects my sentiments in the matter exactly. The directors certainly have a right to know what the report contains before they are called upon to decide the location. At Saturday's meeting it was quite evident that most of those directors who preferred to keep the report sealed are those who have already made up their minds as to which is the best site suggested for the exposition, and to my mind such men are not qualified to serve on a jury that is to decide so important a matter. I say it would be to the best interests of the exposition to have the reports opened and published at once.</p>
<p><note>paragraph begins in the middle of a sentence</note>
public would be to cause the advocates of sites which are not recommended to lose their interest in the matter and they would not work for an appropriation from the legislature. After the report is read the board should use its best judgment as to whether the recommendation of the engineers should be followed or not.</p>    
<p>Edward Dickinson&#8212;I agree with The Bee on the matter of publishing the report of the engineers and heartily endorse its editorial on this subject. There is no question but that the report should be opened and the directors given more than thirty minutes' time to consider it before voting on the location. How much time they should have I am not now prepared to state, but the report should certainly be opened before the meeting which is to decide the location.</p>
<p>J. C. Wharton&#8212;If the report is opened in advance it will be found that four sites are left out and the supporters of those sites will form combinations to defeat the endorsement of the report if they are given time. If the report canvasses the advantages of each site in a fair and imperial spirit I shall be in favor of voting in accordance with the recommendation of the experts. I believe that the site question should be settled at once and was in favor of settling it last Saturday. The sooner it is settled the better, as that will settle the bickering that is now going on.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">INVOLVES TWO POINTS.</head>
<p>Dr. E. W. Lee&#8212;There are two considerations involved in this matter. One is the fear that if the report of the experts was published, the question of site might become involved with the legislative appropriation. The other is the fact that the people should know what the report contains. The managers of the exposition have proceeded regularly up to this point. They have given the exposition a name. They have advertised it to a considerable extent, have opened offices and collected a considerable amount of money. But now they stop short and say that they can proceed no further until the bill now before the legislature is acted upon. I think the last consideration outweighs the former. All things considered, the report of the experts should have been opened and published, and then the directors would have had an opportunity to consider it before they were called on to vote on the question of site.</p>
<p>John L. Webster&#8212;If the report is opened in advance it will simply stir up dissension and the supporters of the sites which are not recommended will try every means to tear down the report and to pick it to pieces. I don't know what the report contains, but if it includes a recommendation of one of the places offered, and if it states good and sound reasons for making such recommendation, I shall consider that in the light of expert testimony and follow the judgment of the engineers, but if the report shows on its face that the makers are unfair and prejudiced, I shall feel justified in using my own judgment.</p>
<p>John H. Evans&#8212;The report should have been made public at once in order that the recommendations of the experts might have been fully discussed before the selection of a site was made. I consider the report only a recommendation, anyway. The experts were brought here to view the different sites and point out their advantages. The board of directors is to select a site after considering the recommendations and suggestions.</p>
<p>G. H. Payne&#8212;I believe the report of the engineers should be opened and directors given an opportunity to investigate and discuss the report before being called upon to decide on the location. As you may have heard I took this position at Saturday's meeting, and am still of the same opinion. I think the directors should carefully investigate the report and inspect the grounds recommended before passing judgment on the matter.</p>
<p>A T. Rector&#8212;I think that a special meeting ought to be called at once, the report read and the site selected. It seems to me that the whole action is a scheme in order that influence might be brought on the legislature to tack onto the appropriation a clause fixing the exposition on some certain site. The state board of agriculture might possibly have something to do in such case in putting in on the state fair grounds. I do not see how the report could otherwise have any effect on the legislature in making an appropriation. The experts were brought here, in my opinion, simply for the purpose of showing what site would require the least grading, sewering and other improvements for the exposition. They simply recommend the most economical site. If the site is not selected, however, it is a good plan to keep the report sealed, or otherwise more feeling would be aroused over the question of site.</p>    
<p>R. S. Wilcox&#8212;If the report is made public in advance of the vote upon the site it will cause a fight from one end of town to the other. I think the matter should have been settled last Saturday, and I am opposed to making the report public in advance. I believe the report of the engineers will have great weight; those men were employed as experts to give an unbiased opinion and I think their advice should be followed. Personally, I am in favor of Miller park, but if the engineers recommend Riverview park or Hanscom park that recommendation will have great weight with me.</p>
<p>C. F. Weller&#8212;The report should have been opened Saturday and the question settled there and then. If the report is made public in advance it will stir up feeling and make a fight and the directors will be chased after by those opposed to the recommendation and by its friends. I am in favor of endorsing the report of the experts. They were employed as experts and are supposed to be competent, therefore their recommendation should have great weight and I believe we should defer to their judgment.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">SHOULD HAVE BEEN OPENED.</head>
<p>J. J. Brown&#8212;I think that the report should have been opened at once and the selection of the site made. In my opinion the report will practically decide the site, because I believe that it was the intention when the directors sent for the experts that their recommendation should be acted upon. Since the site question has been laid over for a couple of weeks, however, I believe it was a good plan to keep the report sealed. Otherwise the directors would have been petitioned to get other experts by those whose site was not selected. I fail to see, however, the benefit to be gained by putting off the selection of the site for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>J. E. Markel&#8212;I have not studied the matter very fully chiefly owing to recent absence from town. So far as I am able to say, I think the report of the engineers should not be opened until the directors are ready to decide the question of location.</p>
<p>Casper E. Yost&#8212;As a member of the special committee to employ these engineers, I do not feel that it would be proper for me to express an opinion on this matter. The board has acted as it saw fit and I am content to leave the question to it for decision.</p>
<p>I. W. Carpenter&#8212;The main object of this action was to leave the matter unsettled in order that our legislators might be unhampered by site advocates in working for an appropriation. I believe that the report ought to have been printed and a copy given to each of the directors in order that they might have considered it before selecting a site. I do not believe that it would have been advisable, however, to give the report to the public. It would have aroused, in my opinion, such bitterness among those whose sites were not chosen that our legislature might have been influenced in the matter of an appropriation.</p>
<p>John A. Creighton&#8212;Since the selection of a site was put over for a couple of weeks I favor the action in keeping the report sealed. If it had been made public and the selection been postponed for two weeks the city would have been at loggerheads and bitter feelings would have been created.</p>
<p>Arthur C. Smith&#8212;On general principles, the selection of the site should be a matter of general publicity and considerable discussion. But under the existing circumstances I am convinced that the interests of the exposition will be best served by holding the matter back until after the legislature has acted.</p>
<p>L. H. Korty&#8212;The action of the committee was emphatically correct. It would be very poor policy in my opinion to make the location just at present.</p>
<p>Charles Metz&#8212;I think the report of the engineers should be opened. The directors and the people at large should be given an opportunity to discuss it. Regarding the time that the report should be opened before the meeting called to decide the location, I cannot say, because I've not fully considered the matter. But I should think that the report should be open for discussion at least one week before the question of location is <note>article ends abruptly</note></p></div3></div2>

<head type="sub">BY THE TRANSMISSISSIPPI PRESS.</head>
<p><note>paragraph starts in the middle of a sentence</note>tion of the resources and pr<unclear reason="covered"></unclear> states west of the Mississippi, to be <unclear reason="covered"></unclear> the city of Omaha in 1898. To carry out this project the Transmississippi and International Exposition association was incorporated last winter, with an authorized capital of $1,000,000, of which over $400,000 has already been raised and the remainder will doubtless be secured within the next six months. In June last congress passed a bill granting recognition to the Transmississippi and International Exposition, pledging not less than $200,000 towards a government exhibit. It is expected that the appropriation will be increased during the coming session to $500,000. The legislature of Nebraska at its biennial session in January will be asked to appropriate at least $250,000. There is no doubt but what such a display is so prominent a western city as Omaha will result in great good. As Montana has been asked to co-operate the different commercial clubs and chambers of commerce should look into the matter and if found advisable, such a display of mineral and other products should be gathered for the occasion that would show to the world that this state excels all others.</p>
<p>Medical Lake (Wash.) Ledger: This is an age of expositions, and just now the Transmississippi and International Exposition, to be held at Omaha in 1898, is attracting a good share of public attention. It is a laudable undertaking, worthy the generous support of the states west of the Mississippi, as its object is to specially set forth to the world the limitless resources and advantages of those states, and to bring to them the homeseeker and investor. Being strictly a western affair, people of the sunset slope will take particular interest in demonstrating their attractions and industries, and in proving to the thousands that will attend this exposition that western hospitality is boundless. Washington should take a front seat in this enterprise.</p>

<pb n="49" xml:id="TMISB02-049"/> 

    
<p>Shelby (Ia.) Republican:  The proposed Transmississippi Exposition, about which so much has been said in the papers of the west in the past couple of years, is now an assured event. It will be held at Omaha next year, opening in June and continuing through October. The chief preliminary work has now been done, the taking of the required subscriptions having been completed some time ago. A board of directors and an executive committee of seven members, who will have charge of the seven departments into which the work has been divided, have both been chosen and the active work of construction and preparation for the show has begun. The national government has appropriated $200,000 for its exhibit and $300,000 more is expected. The citizens of Omaha have subscribed for over $300,000 worth of stock. The legislature of Nebraska is expected to appropriate $250,000. Other states will make big appropriations. Altogether, from $3,000,000 up will be invested in the enterprise, which is sufficient to make quite a respectable exposition, as can be readily appreciated by any one. The state of Iowa should be, and is, largely interested in the success of this enterprise. It is the chief state of the transmississippi empire, and as such will receive the major part of the benefits. We think all of our people will approve of a liberal appropriation by the legislature at the special session now sitting at Des Moines. Our people will also take large individual interest in the exposition and work for its success in the matter of exhibits and in attendance when the exposition is open.</p>
<p>Davenport Democrat: The managers, officers, directors and all others connected with the Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha are pushing things. It will be remembered that the last session of the Iowa general assembly appropriated $10,000 for an exhibit from this state, and it was intimated at the time that this amount would be probably increased. Since that time, however, the state treasurer has discovered a hole in the finances, and this may tend to discourage further appropriations. Of all the great fairs held in this country it can be safely said that the Omaha Exposition will be of more practical importance to the state than any of them.</p>    
<p>Maxwell (Ia.) Tribune: The managers of the Transmississippi Exposition, to be held in Omaha in 1898, are diligently at work to assure the success of the fair. It will be devoted exclusively to the transmississippi states, and will doubtless prove to be the best exhibition of their resources ever presented to the public. We trust the press and legislatures will render such assistance as lies in their power, and the success of the fair will be assured.</p>
<p>Lake City (Minn.) Graphic-Sentinel: When the great White City was built at Chicago and the exposition thrown open to the world, as it was claimed, the object was to bring out the advantages of all parts of the world, but American like, when Europe came here with her enormous show, the managers and the people of this country courteously gave way to their visitors and took what space there was left. Owing to this fact many of the leading advantages of this country, the Grand America, were left in the background, but in 1898 there will be one held at Omaha which will give all of America a chance to show what it contains. This exhibition is to be known as the Transmississippi and International Exposition, and while all nations will be given a chance, yet America this time will look out for America.</p>
    <p>Anderson (Mo.) Advocate: Expositions seem to be the order of the day and somehow or another they are always made to pay. The Transmississippi and International Exposition, announced for 1898 at Omaha, will be no exception to the rule, if the western states will but do their part in helping to make it what it should be. Though some of the recent expositions have shown deficits as to receipts, yet the localities where they have been held have been vastly benefited by a healthy increase in population and development. The Atlanta cotton states exposition turned the tide of immigration and capital from the west to the south. The aim of the exposition of 1898 is to set forth the advantages and limitless resources of states west of the Mississippi and thus attract homeseekers and investors, and it should be liberally supported by every state in the west.</p>
<p>Blue Rapids (Kan.) Times: There are to be two expositions in the great Mississippi valley during the coming two years. One at Omaha, the Transmississippi Valley States Exposition, to be held during the summer of 1898, and for which the legislatures of the valley states will be asked to make appropriations for state exhibits. The Times has made arrangements for articles upon the progress being made upon the Omaha exposition, which we have no doubt will be of interest to our readers. Those who attended the World's fair will remember that a great part of the exhibits were from foreign countries, thus limiting the attention given to American manufactures, while the middle states received almost nothing in the way of advertisement. It is for the purpose of advertising the products and wonderful growth of our own valley states that the Omaha exposition will be held.</p>
<p>Casey (Ia.) Vindicator: Omaha is making strenuous efforts to make the Transmississippi and International Exposition a success. The object of the exposition is to present to the world the resources of the great west. While the exposition is held in a neighboring state, yet Iowa should take an active interest in the fair. An exposition of prod <note>sentence ends abruptly</note> <note>sentence begins abruptly</note> and will increase it to a half million at least. This exposition belongs to Iowa as much as Nebraska, and the same interest should be taken by our own people as by Nebraskans. Our legislature should duly consider the great benefit Iowa will derive from such an exposition and make an appropriation accordingly. Any amount of money appropriated for an Iowa exhibit will only be an investment that will bring back large returns. It is one of the things we cannot afford to deal sparingly with.</p>
<p>Le Mars (Ia.) Daily Sentinel: If there is one thing more than another that the people of Iowa ought to be interested in it is the Transmississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha next summer. it is to be held on the border of our own state and what is better, it is on the western border, where all of the people from Europe and the rich and populous east will be obliged to traverse Iowa's peerless prairies in order to reach the exposition. The state of Iowa invites inspection rather than laudation, for the public is more deeply impressed by what is seen than by what is heard. For this reason alone, the people of Iowa can afford to give the great exposition at Omaha the most earnest support.</p>
<p>If the fair were to be held in Des Moines or any other Iowa city, the people of this state would at once start in with great enthusiasm to push the exposition. Owing to the fact that the great army of investors and citizens who seek new locations come from the east, it is more to the advantage of Iowa to have the exposition held in Omaha than in an Iowa city, because the visitors at the exposition will be obliged to travel over a larger part of Iowa and see more of it than if the fair were held in the central or eastern part of Iowa.</p>
<p>In northwest Iowa in particular we ought to comprehend the benefits of the exposition early and take action to reap as many of them as possible. While the fair will not be so large as the Chicago exposition of 1893, it is so much nearer to us that its effects will be more strongly felt.</p>
<p>Instead of being obliged to travel 500 miles and pay exorbitant hotel rates on arriving at their destination as was so often the case in Chicago, LeMars people can leave home on the early morning train for Omaha, put in a day at the exposition and return home in the evening after supper or they can stay and attend evening entertainments and reach home the next morning in time for business.</p>
<p>The people of Omaha have done a great work toward making the exposition a success. They have raised nearly a half million dollars capital and have begun active operations in all of the states that are expected to be tributary to the fair. The states of the Mississippi valley are organizing to give the world its first intelligent exposition of resources and advantages of the great central region.</p>
<p>Every county in western Iowa ought to be represented in some way at Omaha.</p>
<p>Keystone (S. D.) Miner: The Omaha papers are beginning to agitate the matter of the Transmississippi Exposition to be held in that city next year. An appropriation will be made by congress, commissioners are being appointed by the governors of the states interested and its promises to be a success. There is no question that the only sure road to success is in advertising and the best means of advertising is in displaying the products and resources of the country at some central point and offering inducements to all the people to come and see. This great inland region is as yet scarcely settled; it could easily support ten times the population it now has, and the way to fill up the country is to encourage immigration by every legitimate means and this exposition promises to become the best opportunity we have had for this purpose. The Black Hills cannot afford to fail to take every advantage of this change to advertise our resources, and in addition to the commissioner for the state at large we should have one of our own. We had a miserably meager show at the World's fair in '93 and failed to attract the attention of the world in exact ratio to the scantiness of our display, and this is our chance to redeem ourselves.</p>
<p>Sanborn (Ia.) Pioneer: Our readers, most of them, at least, are not aware of the fact that next year there is to be held at Omaha one of the greatest interstate and international expositions ever attempted in this country. It is based on the fact that advertising pays. In years gone by Philadelphia, New Orleans, Atlanta, San Francisco, and Chicago have all been built up, strengthened in every way and largely increased in population and the country for hundreds of miles in all directions greatly enriched by the expositions. These things are simply advertisements to attract and draw population and capital. New Orleans was a dead city after the war until resurrected by the great exposition of 1884. In a less degree, but still powerfully, the other expositions named enriched and built up not only the cities where held, but the adjacent country for hundreds of miles in all directions. The Omaha exposition is sure to do for the transmississippi regions what the other expositions did for the regions what the other expositions did for the regions in which held.</p>
<p>This is not simply an Omaha affair, but a great, grand interstate and international exposition, aided by state and national appropriations. The city of Omaha will be greatly benefited no doubt, but the advantages gained by the states adjacent to Omaha will be hundreds of times greater.</p>
<p>The Iowa legislature will appropriate something, of course, toward this exposition and we hope the appropriation will be in keeping with the benefits sure to be derived.</p></div2>

<p>The Transmississippi Exposition again came up for considerations of the Central Labor union at its regular meeting last night. The matter culminated in the almost unanimous passage of a resolution instructing Director Youngs of the exposition board, who is labor's representative in that body, to cast his vote for the Hanscom park site when a vote is taken on the question of a location.</p>
<p>This action was taken because it was held that the Hanscom park site is the most advantageous to the laboringmen for various reasons. The principle one is that the site is the nearest to the heart of the city. It was also argued that the site was such that considerable work would be given laboring men in the way of grading. The matter was settled and the instructions were given after but little discussion.</p>
<p>William Grabach, who took to Lincoln the union's recommendation that the exposition appropriation bill contain provision for the employment of local labor on the exposition at certain wages, reported progress.

<head type="sub">Would-Be Exhibitors Make Application for Space.</head>
<p>Notices of assessment on exposition stock are being sent out from the secretary's office. At the meeting of the Board of Directors held January 9 an assessment of 15 per cent was ordered, payable in three installments of 5 per cent each. The first installment of this assessment will be due February 1, the second on or before March 1 and the third on or before April 1. The three notices are being mailed at the same time, with the idea that some of the stockholders may prefer to pay the entire assessment at one time instead of making three payments. A new system has been adopted whereby a rush of the stockholders to pay their assessments can be taken care of without delay, thus obviating the difficulty surrounding the payment of the first assessment.</p>
<p>The exposition is to have a beauty show, application for 1,000 feet of space for that purpose having been made to the Department of Concessions by two residents of Omaha. The application states that the show is to be an international affair.</p>
<p>The Department of Exhibits has received a lengthy letter of inquiry from a large brewing establishment in Munich, Germany, asking for information bearing upon the establishment of an exhibit showing a brewery in full operation. Particular inquiry is made regarding the power, facilities for constructing a large cooling cellar, etc., and the statement is made that it is the purpose of the brewing company to erect a plant for the purpose of showing the complete operation of a brewery, with a view of convincing the public that the product is pure and wholesome.</p>

<head type="sub">MONEY FOR THE EXPOSITION ASSURED</head>
<head type="sub">Legislators Not Inclined to Meddle with the Money Already Set Aside for the Hawkeye Representation at Omaha.</head>
<p>DES MOINES, Jan. 28.&#8212;(Special Telegram)&#8212;The Iowa legislature will stand by the Transmississippi Exposition. This may be set down as assured. There has been some effort to give the impression that the appropriation made a year ago might be

<pb n="50" xml:id="TMISB02-050"/> 

withdrawn, temporarily, on account of the state's embarrassment financially, but there is no real ground for it. The appropriation will not be interfered with at this time, and it will be increased to $60,000 to $75,000&#8212;probably the latter figure&#8212;later on.</p>
<p>When the legislature met it was faced by a deficit of nearly $500,000, and Governor Drake in his message recommended a review of all appropriations of the last session in order that, if possible, they might be pared down. The ways and means committees of both houses have named subcommittees and they have been at work in this direction; but they do not propose to forget the pledge of the state's good faith that was made when the first appropriation was made a year ago.</p>
<p>The appropriation was $10,000, conditioned on congress making a liberal donation and likewise the legislature of Nebraska. Congress has done its part, although of this fact there was no official notice till a few days ago. The Iowa bill provided that the state executive council should have the power, at any time after the official announcement was received of an appropriation by congress, to name a board of commissioners for the state to have charge of the expenditure of the money appropriated. By some mistake the executive council was not notified officially of this appropriation, and the appointment of the commissioners has been delayed, but it is announced that the board will now be named in a few days.</p>
<p>A number of prominent Iowa men who are interested in the proper representation of the state at Omaha, met here today and discussed the situation. They secured assurances from the appropriation committees that the first appropriation was safe; then they secured a pledge of assistance to get it increased later on, in ample time to make a good exhibit. The executive council was sounded, and found to be all right, and now it is expected the commission will be named very soon.</p>
<p>The Transmississippi Exposition is strong is the legislature, and in the state at large is just beginning to receive appreciative attention. it is conceded that Iowa ought to make the best exhibit that of Nebraska, and that there should be no niggardliness about it. And there will be none. The first appropriation of $10,000 was only preliminary, and was made with the understanding that, in ample time for its practical use, a much larger amount should be added.</p></div2>
    
<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">FAVORS A LIBERAL APPROPRIATION</head>    
<head type="sub">Senator Allen Expresses Himself on the Exposition.</head>
<p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 28.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Senator Allen, in an interview with The Bee regarding the Transmississippi and International Exposition, and replying to an inquiry as to what was his general view of the enterprise, said: "It is a gigantic enterprise. It will affect the future of Nebraska very materially. Our people are familiar with the history of the exposition as made in congress. The law authorizing it was the work of populists, to a very great extent. The bill was introduced by me in the senate a year ago this month, and the enterprise must be regarded largely as populistic. I do not doubt the holding of the exposition will be the greatest event of Nebraska's history thus far, and one of the greatest events in its entire history. It will take millions of people to Omaha, and distribute them through the state, cities, country towns and precincts&#8212;people who would otherwise never visit us or know anything of the state, and who will spend more or less money incident to their travels. Many of them will become permanent residents. They will purchase real estate, build homes and improve farms, and Nebraska will become infinitely richer in consequence thereof. When we take into consideration the great benefit to the middle western states produced by the World's fair, it will be readily seen that this is an enterprise, the great benefits of which Nebraska and western Iowa alone will receive."</p>
<p>"What do you think the legislature will do toward making the exposition a success?" was asked the senator.</p>    
<p>"Of course, I regard it as important that Nebraska should do her full share for the success of the undertaking," he said. "Whatever the legislature does will be regarded as a precedent for legislatures of other states. I know that taxes rest heavily on our people; they are tax-ridden to a very great extent, but I feel confident the taxes that may be imposed to make an exhibit at the exposition will be more than compensated by corresponding benefits derived from the holding of the exposition. In other words, I think that property throughout Nebraska will be advanced, capital will be invested and new enterprises be started by reason thereof. In my judgment not less than from $12,000,000 to $15,000,000 will be spent by visitors and those intending to become residents, in one form or another, and this money will be scattered among the merchants, farmers, laborers and all other classes. I look upon the success of the exposition as the only real hope for relief our state will have in the immediate future. The legislature can be relied upon to do what is right and even what is generous."</p>
<p>"How will the populist members of the legislature stand on the appropriation for a state exhibit?" was asked.</p>
<p>"I can only speak in a general way," said Senator Allen, "for I am not in communication with any of the members of the legislature on the subject, but I have no doubt they will favor a bill making a reasonable appropriation. You will understand that the responsibility for defeat or injury of the exposition must not be laid at the door of the populist party. Our party will guard every avenue and protect every interest, and republicans and gold democrats must not be permitted to truthfully say the populists unreasonably obstructed a reasonable and proper appropriation to make the exposition successful. I do not doubt the wisdom of the populist members of the legislature They can be relied on to do what is right. I think the people of Nebraska have their hearts set on this exposition, and it would be regarded as a great misfortune for it to miscarry at his time. After it has been pushed along successfully thus far, we could not stand the chagrin that would be caused us by letting the enterprise lapse.</p>
<p>"I expect before the general government has gotten through, we will be able to get $500,000. We have $200,000 now, which will doubtless be increased to $275,000 by this congress. The government building will no doubt be donated to the state, and an additional appropriation of $225,000 be made as the exposition progresses to meet other necessary expenses. Such is usually the course pursued."</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">HELP FOR THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">Enterprise Commended to Liberal Treatment from Western States.</head>
<ab>Chicago Chronicle.</ab>
<p>At the last session of congress an act was passed to promote the objects of the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held next year at Omaha. No direct subsidy is granted by the terms of the act, but the government gives material help in other ways.</p>
<p>A building will be erected by the United States in which exhibits from the various departments will be made similar to those in the government building at the Chicago World's fair in 1893. Exhibits will also be furnished by the Smithsonian institution, the United States Fish commission and the National museums. A board of United States commissioners will be appointed to prepare and manage the exhibits and the superintend the affairs of the government building.</p>
<p>An appropriation of $50,000 was made for the building and $150,000 was appropriated for the expense of preparing the United States exhibits, including transportation. The United States commissioners will not be paid a salary, but will be reimbursed for their actual expenses.</p>
<p>All articles intended for the foreign department of the exposition shall be admitted duty free, but the usual duty shall be paid if the exhibits are sold. A circular letter from the United States Treasury department gives instructions to all customs collectors and other officers as to their duties in regard to imported articles for exhibition. The instructions are complete and perspicuous and are as liberal for exhibitors as the state would warrant.</p>
<p>The Omaha Exposition ought to be very well supported by private enterprise throughout the country. Especially Chicago and Illinois should be represented. As much should be done for Omaha as was done for Atlanta in 1896. All the states that were liberal in their dealings with the Chicago World's fair should receive proper returns for similar minor enterprises which may be instituted.</p>
<p>The senate put in the forenoon in a red hot discussion on sugar bounty, the debate being precipitated by a motion to indefinitely postpone Senator Spencer's resolution pledging the senate to payment of sugar bounty voted by the last legislature. The sentiment of the senate was clearly in favor of postponing the resolution, but when the debate had lasted until 12:30, the senate adjourned until tomorrow morning, leaving Senator Ransom's speech in closing unfinished. When Senator Ransom was in the midst of his argument Senator Conaway of York asked him why the state of Nebraska should be taxed to pay for an exposition at Omaha. Ransom at once took advantage of the opening presented, and at once launched into a vigorous argument in favor of the exposition. When the senate adjourned it did so with the agreement that Senator Ransom should continue his remarks. He will, of course, complete his answer to the question of the senator from York county, and he promises to place the exposition before the senate in its proper light.</p></div2>

    <div3>
<p>The exposition is to have a special building devoted to the Grand Army of the Republic, and an exhibit of war relics such as has never been made before in this country. This was decided at the regular meeting of the executive committee of the Exposition association held yesterday afternoon at the Commercial Club. The matter came up in the shape of a resolution introduced by Mr. Hitchcock, providing for such an exhibit.</p>
<p>Major T. S. Clarkson, commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, has been consulted in the matter, and he felt confident that such an exhibit could be made a most attractive feature of the exposition by securing articles from the extensive collection of the government and from the valuable and extensive collections of private parties in various parts of the country. No exposition which has been given so far has made a feature of a Grand Army department, and Major Clarkson agreed that such a department would form a strong attraction for all old soldiers.</p>
<p>The idea met with favor with the other members of the committee and was discussed somewhat in detail. It was thought that a most extensive collection of war relics could be made, which would form a strong feature, and the resolution was adopted, it being provided that the commander-in-chief of the Grand Army be asked to co-operate in the matter and give it his endorsements.</p></div3>

<head type="sub">TO ADVERTISE THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>A committee appeared before the executive committee from the Board of Commissioners appointed by the mayor to represent the interests of Omaha at the Tennessee Centennial exposition at Nashville. This committee consisted of Major Clarkson, George R. Williams and Secretary Howard. Major Clarkson acted as spokesman and said the committee had been deputized to appear before the executive committee and ask that body to appropriate $5,000 for the purpose of enabling the commission to advertise the Transmississippi Exposition at Nashville, and to secure exhibits from among the exhibitors at that place. The speaker explained that the commission has already opened negotiations with a number of leading manufacturers and commercial establishments of this section, and has memorialized the county commissioners and the city council to supply the commission with $1,500 and $3,500 respectively for the purpose of carrying out the work of the commission in making a creditable showing of the resources and conditions of this section. The request of the delegation was taken under advisement, and laid over until the next meeting of the executive committee, owing to the fact that Messrs. Kirkendall, Reed and Rosewater were absent, and a bare quorum of the committee was present.</p>
<p>The Department of Promotion reported the names of the several vice presidents recently appointed by the governors of different states, which have already been published, and the appointees were legally elected vice presidents.</p>
<p>A rule was adopted which fixes the hours of the various employes in the headquarters of the exposition. It was ordered that the offices should be open and business transacted between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., with an hour's intermission at noon.</p></div3></div2>
    
<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">NEBRASKA FOR THE EXPOSITION.</head>    
<p>Fairfield News-Herald: The part of Governor Holcomb's message that refers to the Transmississippi Exposition should be carefully read by each member of the legislature, morning, noon and night, until that body passes the appropriation bill for its support. Much depends upon what Nebraska will do in this matter. That other states will make appropriation is assured, but the amount they will give will be governed largely by what Nebraska does. If it is shown that Nebraska intends doing her part, others will respond likewise. The way for Nebraska to do this is for the legislature to respond liberally and do it quickly. The eyes of the world are upon the legislature of our states, watching what it will do in the matter.</p>
<p>Albion News: A a bill appropriating $350,000 for the Transmississippi Exposition has been introduced in the legislature. We think it is very generally conceded that there should be a generous appropriation for this, but just what amount would be "generous" is the question.</p>

    <pb n="51" xml:id="TMISB02-051"/> 



<p>Burchard Times: In Governor Holcomb's message to the legislature he spoke of the Transmississippi Exposition in glowing terms. He speaks of the many thousands of people who will visit the great west in that year. He says also: "It will do for the west what the Atlanta exposition has done for the south, but in a larger degree."</p>
<p>Tecumseh Chieftain: The members of the legislature are not taking very kindly to the proposed appropriation of $350,000 in aid of the Transmississippi Exposition. Some of them argue that Omaha would get all the benefit of the expenditure of the appropriation and that the money belonging to all the people should not be expended for the benefit of a few. Others take the ground that the state, being in straitened financial circumstances, ought to be just before she is generous, and they advocate the payment of the state's indebtedness before branching out into an expensive exposition project. A few of the strictly home-spun populists think there is some political scheme connected with the movement and they are as hostile as a band of Cuban insurgents. There is some foundation for the first two objections named, and yet we believe a little investigation will show that it is not substantial enough to thwart the exposition scheme. Omaha, being the seat of the exposition, will of course receive greater advantage from the project than any other equal area of the state. But it must be remembered that Omaha is a part of Nebraska, the business center of the state, and that whatever affects her material interests also reaches out and has an influence throughout all the country tributary to Omaha. The exposition will bring hundreds of thousands of people to Omaha from the eastern states, and many of them will not only view the exposition but will travel more or less about the state and thus come in personal contact with the resources of this important section of the transmississippi country. The intimate acquaintance thus formed will, in many instances, lead to investment. Again, the state is in need of a good advertisement. Many eastern people never think of Nebraska save as a drouth-stricken, wind-swept, famine-ridden country which no one lives in who can possibly get away. The exposition would be the means of effectually correcting that most erroneous idea and its removal from the eastern mind would be greatly to our advantage in many ways. The Transmississippi Exposition will certainly prove a powerful influence in the higher development of the state, and we regard as most foolish all opposition to the project that is based on the fact that it is to be located in Omaha. Regarding the amount which our legislature ought to appropriate for a state exhibit there are many different opinions. Perhaps $350,000 is more than our finances would justify, but at any rate the appropriation should be large enough to make a showing of which every Nebraskan can be proud and which will not thwart the object which the exposition is primarily intended to promote.</p>

<p>Pierce Call: While in Omaha last week we got enough insight into the Transmississippi Exposition to believe that it will be the greatest advertisement for our state that has yet been attempted. It will undoubtedly be next to the World's fair in its importance and results. It is not a visionary scheme, but is backed by the substantial and influential men of Omaha and the great west. It means much to Nebraska and the western states. Gurdon W. Wattles, who is well known in Pierce, is at the head of the exposition and has the ability to push it to a successful issue. Mr. Rosewater, editor of the foremost daily in the west, is in charge of the Department of Publicity and is the right man in the right place. The gentlemen at the head of the other departments are as well known as the two just mentioned. The exposition is bound to be a success and of untold benefit to our own state. Other states are looking toward Nebraska, therefore the state legislature should not be niggardly when it comes to an appropriation.</p>

<p>Fullerton News: The proposed Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha from June to November, 1898, is something which will help the state in many ways, and Governor Holcomb takes that view of it in his biennial message to the legislature. A practical way for the legislature to stand up for Nebraska will be for it to make a reasonable appropriation for a Nebraska exhibit. All the states of the Mississippi valley are preparing to make appropriations and the state which is going to reap the rewards of its being held on its own soil cannot afford to take a back seat. It is true that the state needs to practice economy, but the taxpayers can afford something which is going to bring them a return in the increased valuation of their property.</p>
    
<p>Exeter Democrat: The Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha during the summer and autumn of 1898 will attract great numbers of people from every section of the country. It will be the greatest exposition of western products ever held and will accomplish great good in bringing together the varied interests of the west and cementing the friendly relations already existing between the people of this wealth-producing region of the country. <choice><sic>Naturaly</sic><corr>Naturally</corr></choice> Nebraska will profit to a great extent by having this exposition on her soil. Eastern people will not confine themselves to visiting Omaha alone, but will travel our state from one end to the other and doubtless many of them, after noting the advantages our state offers, will never return east with a view of remaining there any longer than will be necessary to close their business affairs. The push and enterprise of the west has an attraction about it that eastern people cannot resist and once they have been here they seldom return to the east to live. Millions of dollars will be brought into our state to be paid out for food and drink for man and beast, and as the people of Nebraska will have to supply all this, that vast amount of money will therefore be put into circulation in our state. The erection of numerous and costly buildings in Omaha will provide employment for many men who are now idle, and taking it all in all the Transmississippi Exposition will be a Godsend to the people of Nebraska and we trust our legislature will make an appropriation that the people of the state will not be ashamed of. Stand up for Nebraska by booming along the exposition.</p>

<p>Crete Vidette: Voting an appropriation for the exposition these hard times is like having one's teeth pulled. But if the appropriation will attract 3,000,000 visitors, as its friends assume, it will be casting bread upon the waters which will return after many days. Since the general government has made a liberal appropriation and the city of Omaha has responded nobly, the state should come to the rescue. The action of Nebraska will have much influence upon neighboring states. A good appropriation put into the hands of an honest, competent committee will place the state in a position that will warrant the vice presidents in making an earnest appeal for the hearty co-operation of sister states.</p>

<p>Grand Island Independent: The Nebraska legislature cannot afford to hesitate in its support of the Transmississippi Exposition. True, the state finances are not in such condition as to warrant any unusual expenditure of public funds, even for an exposition, but none will deny that a careful consideration of the same should be given, followed with such an appropriation that Nebraskans will be in a position to ask their neighbors to join with them in erecting a building and making an attractive exhibit at the exposition.</p>
<p>Already the transmississippi country is awakening to the importance of the show and the opportunity it will afford the great west to display to the world the wonderful and undeveloped resources of the country tributary to the Mississippi and Missouri valleys, with the special opportunities it will afford the east and west to unite in a great exposition midway across the continent. There is no denying the great amount of good it will accomplish. But, unfortunately, it comes at a time when Nebraska is like its people, just reviving from a period of financial depression and drouth such as the great west has never before known, and the state, like individuals, is in no condition for any lavish expenditures. However, the people will demand that the legislature handle this matter with a due regard to the circumstances. The exposition should receive an appropriation that will give the directory an opportunity to lead in the results to be accomplished, and at the same time not cripple the state for the next decade.</p>
    
<p>Burwell Mascot: Nebraska needs advertising of the right sort and the legislature will do well to act on the advice of the governor and make a liberal appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>

<p>Beatrice Democrat: The legislature should do a liberal thing for the Transmississippi Exposition. Nebraska must come to the front promptly and liberally if we expect other states to respond to the invitation and put their money into the exposition.</p></div2>

<p>The Department of Concessions of the exposition has received an application for 7,500 square feet of space for a Ferris wheel 150 feet in diameter, capable of carrying 500 passengers at one time. The application is made by W. H. Bongart of Cripple Creek, Colo.</p>

Ex-Governor Clark recommended, in his message delivered a few days ago, that a liberal appropriation be made by Arkansas for exhibits at Omaha and at Nashville, and stated that there was $25,000 in the treasury available for that purpose and he recommended that the money be used in that way. Governor Jones told Lieutenant Koehler that he would favor an appropriation, and the lieutenant expresses the opinion that a bill carrying appropriations for both Omaha and Nashville will undoubtedly be passed in the near future.</p></div2>

<p>OMAHA, Jan. 29.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: Regarding the location of the Transmississippi Exposition, there seems to be very much talk and no action, and if we are not awake we will lose it altogether.</p>
<p>Of course, I believe we should abide somewhat by the decision of the expert engineers, but then we are not doing the right thing by waiting for the action of the Nebraska legislature. We should go ahead and locate the exposition regardless of the legislature, as no doubt there are enough honest people in Nebraska and other states who, after being once assured of the location, would increase their stock subscription. If we do not take action soon it is rumored on good authority that there is a city a few hundred miles south that is dead anxious to secure it without a moment's delay. It is Kansas City, and it offered $1,000,000.</p>

<p>After agreeing that it would be <choice><sic>abvisable</sic><corr>advisable</corr></choice> for the city of Omaha and the county of Douglas to make an exhibit at the Tennessee Centennial, it was decided to take steps looking toward the securing of funds for this purpose and by a unanimous vote, the officers of the commission were instructed to request the county commissioners to appropriate $1,500; the city of Omaha, $3,500 and the Transmississippi International and Exposition association, $5,000, this money to be used in defraying the expenses of making an exhibit and maintaining offices on the grounds in order that the plans and scope of the Transmississippi Exposition may be properly presented to the people of the southern states. President Clarkson and Vice President Williams will call the matter to the attention of the county commissioners. Howard M. Wallace and Treasurer Davis will meet the city council, while President Clarkson and Vice President Williams will lay the matter before the Board of Directors of the Transmississippi Exposition association.</p>
<p>Secretary Howard was instructed to visit or communicate with the manufacturers and probable exhibitors of the city and county for the purpose of ascertaining their ideas with relation to taking a part in the Tennessee Centennial.</p>

<head type="main">Exposition Endorsements</head> 
    <head type="sub">BY THE TRANSMISSISSIPPI PRESS.</head>
<p>Little Rock (Ark.) Gazette: Two expositions, which should create great interest in Arkansas on account of the opportunities which will be afforded for exhibition of the resources of the state, will be held within the next two years. The first is the Tennessee Centennial and International exposition, which will be held at Nashville from May 1 to October 30, 1897. The second is the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha, commencing June 1, and continuing until November 1, 1898. In his message Governor Clarke recommended that the legislature make suitable provision for the representation of Arkansas at each of these expositions.</p>
<p>The scope of the Transmississippi Exposition of 1898 is much more extensive than any interstate or international exhibition, excepting the Columbian World's fair, but the underlying motive and objects are the same as those which called into being the expositions at New Orleans, Atlanta and San Francisco. The twenty states and territories embraced in the Transmississippi region cover an area of more than 2,500,000 square miles, with an aggregate population of 25,000,000. They represent fully twenty billions of wealth. They are the great granary of America, and contain within their boundaries practically all of the gold and silver mines besides iron, copper, zinc, lead and other minerals. They embrace the greatest bodies of timber on the North American continent, as well as a large portion of the cotton belt, and all the sugar-producing lands within the boundaries of the union. The railroads within the transmississippi states aggregate 65,000 miles, and the navigable waterways include the greatest of American rivers. The legislatures of Iowa and Louisiana have already made appropriations for preliminary works, and it is expected that all of the states will be represented.</p>
<p>Both of these enterprises merit the serious consideration of our legislators, as it is of the greatest importance that the products of Arkansas shall be exhibited. Expositions are conceded to be the most effective method of advertising a country's resources and the money expended through them comes back rapidly and returns are more profitable than by any other known medium or investment. Neither of these enterprises are instituted for benevolent purposes. They are purely matters of business, which clear-headed, progressive business men can endorse as safe and sound. It now devolved upon the Arkansas legislature to keep pace with our sister states, and prompt action is looked for.</p>
<p>Evans (Colo.) Courier: The Transmississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha, Neb., in 1898 will undoubtedly be a fine thing, and being so close to Colorado we will all have a chance to take it in, unless the money question continues to grow worse. The state legislature of Nebraska has made an appropriation of $350,000 to start the work. Colorado, Kansas and the rest of the western states should call in line at once and help this cause along. It will be one of the finest advertisements of the west that has ever came up, as it will induce the eastern people to come west and see our country, that they think is only fit for the coyote and Indians to inhabit and not entitled to any legislation. Now is your time to make them change their minds by giving a display that will surpass anything heretofore produced. Now is the time for our legislature to take action on this matter, and we hope they will do so by making a liberal appropriation. We will get it all back tenfold in 1899.</p>
<p>Avoca (Minn.) Independent: The Transmississippi and International Exposition will be held at Omaha from June 1 to November, 1898. If carried out as planned it will be a great western enterprise, and judging from the prospectus already sent out the city of Omaha will be able to handle such a great exposition. That city has a public library containing 52,304 volumes.</p>
<p>Des Moines Farmers' Tribune: The Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898 promises to be a big affair and will no doubt attract worldwide attention to the Mississippi valley and western states and be the means of bringing in millions of dollars for our cheap land and undeveloped resources.</p>

<p><note>sentence begins abruptly</note> not "in it" except incidentally. The present exposition is to be on a large scale. The capital stock of the corporation is $1,000,000, and a permanent organization was effected December 1. The exposition will have the recognition of congress, a government building and exhibit, and the legislatures of all the transmississippi states are expected to appropriate sufficient amounts to make fitting displays. The project is one to be commended. The possibilities of this great west are unbounded. No better advertisement for this part of the country could be devised. It is time that those in the east who imagine this a wild and woolly land, full of deserts and overrun by Indians, come here and learn the contrary. The aggregation of products and of industries represented would soon show what we are and what possibilities for development and investment are to be found here. Minnesota, as one of the best states in this group, ought to occupy a prominent place in this exposition, and a proper amount of interest and appreciation of its value be shown by our people. It is left with the legislature to make the necessary appropriations, and the constituents of each member of that body ought to speak approvingly of the project.</p>
    
<p>Sibley (Ia.) Gazette: The great Transmississippi and International Exposition, to be held in Omaha in 1898, will more closely appeal to the people of this district than anything of that kind that has yet been held in the United States. There are live men at the head of the movement and it success is assured.</p>
<p>The Hills (Minn.) Crescent: The Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha between the first day of June and the first day of November, 1898, will prove to be a grand affair and will result in much benefit to the western states, as this exposition is designed to afford an opportunity for the states west of the Mississippi to make an exhibition of their resources and productive industries. This movement should receive the hearty co-operation of all the western states.</p>
<p>Corning (Ia.) Union: A letter from E. Rosewater, editor of The Omaha Bee, informs us that he has accepted the position of manager of the Department of Publicity of the 1898 Transmississippi Exposition. Mr. Rosewater writes: "You doubtless realize that the Columbian exposition was monopolized largely by foreign exhibitors, while the exhibit of the transmississippi region was merely an incident to the aggregation upon the marvelous resources of the Mississippi valley."</p>
<p>That is what Adams county farmers need and want. This is what interests southwest Iowa, for we are nearer Omaha than most Nebraska counties and infinitely better able to toot our horn and call attention to our resources.</p>
<p>The Blue Grass Palace idea added from $5 to $10 to every acre of Adams county land. Our land is still $20 an acre behind eastern Iowa land of the same inherent qualities. We can make money no faster than by inviting the development of our crude products, the manufacture of all our raw materials into some useful articles.</p>
<p>There is no reason why we should buy tons of paper of all kinds made in other states while the straw and wood are rotting all about us. There is no good reason why we should ship out hides by the carload and ship in leather and shoes from Indiana and Illinois. There is no good reason why we should not make here in southwest Iowa one-half the articles we ship in from long distances. All we need is the development of our natural resources. The Omaha exposition is calculated to help do this. Let us make it our exposition.</p>
<p>It will prove a slot machine, in which, if we drop pennies, we may catch Bryan dollars as they roll out.</p>
<p>A number of Corning citizens have signified their willingness to undertake a representation of Adams county's resources at the exposition. Among them are the gentlemen who helped make the Blue Grass Palace exhibit the prize winner&#8212;Messrs. A. M. Beymer, J. E. Bell and others. The old Corning Board of Trade should be revived to do this work and the farmers of all Adams county should volunteer help and supplies.</p>
<p>Let Adams county, Iowa, take the leading place among the local exhibits at the Omaha exposition.</p>

<p>Blunt (S. D.) Advocate the Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898 from June to November will no doubt be the greatest exposition of products of the great west ever held. Nearly half a million dollars have already been subscribed toward the capital stock. Congress has appropriated $200,000 in aid of the enterprise, Iowa has voted $10,000 for an exhibit, which it will probably increase, and appropriations and liberal support may be expected from all of the western and southern states, as well as from most of those farther east. Various national organizations are arranging to hold their annual sessions there that year in order to visit the exposition. Every state that participates will receive a benefit.</p>
<p>South Dakota should take a proper interest in so important an affair as this, to take place so near to her borders and so full of probable benefit for her in the way of attracting immigration. The legislature should be all means appropriate an amount sufficient to provide for a suitable representation and exhibit.</p>

<p>Argyle (Minn.) Banner: The Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha, Neb., June 1 to November 1, 1898, will be an affair almost as great as the World's fair of 1893. Preparations are now in progress in the different states for large appropriations, and the supervision of the exposition is in charge of able and prominent men. Omaha, located midway between New York and San Francisco, will be a central point for such an exposition, giving to the people an equal chance to reach the point of interest. Omaha has a population of 140,000 and covers an area of twenty-four square miles. Twenty states and territories are embraced as the transmississippi region.</p>

<p>Eatonville (Wash.) Eagle: Preliminary arrangements are being made for the exposition to be held at Omaha next year. A suitable place for an exposition is in a fertile region. The Mississippi and Missouri valleys, the garden of the world, with their vast resources, may well be considered as one of the best localities that could be selected. As an advertising proposition a successful exposition is found to be of prime importance. It has been estimated that from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 people will visit the exposition, thousands of whom will find homes in the beautiful prairie country on this side of the Mississippi or on the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>Skidmore (Mo.) Standard: While the Transmississippi and International Exposition at Omaha may not be so great in having as large displays from foreign countries as the World's fair at Chicago, it is intended to show up the resources of the great country west of the Mississippi in a far better way that has ever been done before. But it is not only the great west that will be on exhibition, but every part of the United States will be represented as well as foreign countries.</p>
<p>There has never been an exposition of a national character held in the central part of the great west, and all the states west of the Mississippi should avail themselves of the opportunity of making a good display at Omaha next year.</p>
<p>We hope our legislators will consider the matter favorable and make our appropriation sufficient to show Missouri up in fine shape.</p>
<p>Now let us all do what we can to help make the Transmississippi and International Exposition a grand success, for it will help the whole western country.</p>

<p>Colutta (Texas) Isonomy: A successful fair or exposition is deservedly a pilot of the cars of progress. Turn the pages of history and see the truth of the above exemplified by the Centennial, the New Orleans, the Columbian, the Atlanta expositions and the San Francisco Midwinter fair. Heralding the advent of the great Paris exposition, to be in 1900, comes the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be at Omaha, Neb., from June to November, 1898. </p>

<p>Minneapolis Lumberman: It is proposed to hold a Transmississippi and International Exposition at Omaha for several months during next year. Judging from the editorials on the proposed expositions which have recently appeared in the press, it is evident that the people of Nebraska and the Missouri valley expect great things to result from it. It is proposed to make this exposition the biggest advertisement that has ever been attempted for Nebraska as well as the states beyond the Rockies. It will be remembered that the tidal wave began to turn westward in the early 70s. It was the result of organized effort on the part of the great railways, which had become possessed of millions of acres of land, worthless unless it could be cultivated by industrious settlers. Millions of dollars were expended in advertising homes for the people from the overcrowded districts of the eastern states. It is the idea of the promoters of the Transmississippi Exposition to have it bring into prominence the resources of the Transmis-

<pb n="53" xml:id="TMISB02-053"/> 



sissippi country and induce still further settlement of its unsettled lands. Another way in which the exposition will benefit Nebraska, and Omaha in particular, will be through the money expended by those who visit the exposition. It is estimated that from $20,000,000 to $30,000,000 will pass into Nebraska through the exposition, and many of the people who come that far will go still farther, and thus it will serve to advertise the country between the Mississippi river and the Pacific coast. Its promoters say that the great west, with its limitless energy and its resistless push, will in 1898 present an exposition to the world the success of which will more than justify very liberal appropriations from Nebraska and other western states. It is expected that the legislature of Nebraska now in session, will appropriate a large sum of money for carrying on the work. There is no doubt but what the western country, to which there went so many settlers between twenty and thirty years ago, needs something of a stimulus, such as the proposed exposition, to start another tide of western immigration. If the exposition is made a success it will be of great benefit to the Transmississippi territory.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">PARK BOARD AND THE EXPOSITION</head>
<head type="sub">It Considers a Levy Large Enough to Improve the Site Selected.</head>
<p>President <choice><sic>Wattlens</sic><corr>Wattles</corr></choice> of the Transmississippi Exposition association met the Board of Park Commissioners at their rooms in the city hall yesterday afternoon to urge the request for a 3 mill levy for park purposes, the balance over the cost of maintaining the parks to be used for the improvement of whatever park should be secured as the site of the exposition. Mr Wattles stated that a careful examination of the law had indicated that the only way in which the city could lend any assistance to the exposition was through the Board of Park Commissioners. The plan suggested was the only means by which the non-resident taxpayers and local property owners who had failed or refused to subscribe could be reached. He stated that the excess in the proposed fund would go a good ways toward beautifying whatever site might be selected, and the improvements made would be of a permanent character that would remain for the benefit of the park.</p>
<p>President Tukey of the board expressed himself as favoring the plan. He stated that at the most it would only be anticipating the improvements that would naturally be made at the park during the next few years. He thought the action of the board in that particular would be endorsed by the people.</p>
<p>The same ground was again gone over at the meeting this forenoon. Mr. Wharton, somewhat contrary to expectations, fell in with the proposition. After a long discussion the matter was settled by the adoption of a resolution which provided that the council should be asked for a 3-mill levy for park purposes, the residue to be used for the improvement of whatever park was selected as the site for the exposition. Thomas Kilpatrick was the only member who voted against the resolution. He said that he did not wish to be understood as being against the exposition. It would benefit him probably more than any other member of the board. But he believed that the board should be as economical as possible this year. The board and the exposition should each stand on its own bottom.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">Colored Race and the Exposition.</head>
<p>Another meeting of colored men was held at the office of Dr. M. O. Ricketts last night to talk over the question of proper representation by their race at the Transmississippi Exposition. The committees appointed at a previous meeting to investigate the exhibits at the Atlanta and Nashville expositions reported, and these reports were referred to a committee, to be appointed later, to tabulate, preparatory to presenting to the exposition directory. The reports of the work of their race at these two expositions were very encouraging to the men present at the meeting last night and they feel that with proper financial help they will be able to make an exhibit which will be a credit to themselves and an attraction to the exposition to be held here in 1898.</p></div2>

    <div3>
<p>The management of the Trans-Mississippi exposition will at once confer with Commander-in-Chief Clarkson of the Grand Army of the Republic with reference to a building and an exhibit of the Grand Army at the exposition. At the meeting yesterday of the executive committee the following resolutions, introduced by Mr. Hitchcock, were passed:</p>
<p>Resolved, That it is the sense of this committee that a desirable feature of the exposition would be a Grand Army of the Republic building to be erected upon the grounds and placed in charge of the commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, to be headquarters for all old soldiers and to contain an exhibit of war relics and other matters of interest to old soldiers and their families, and to be known as a war museum.</p>
<p>Resolved, That the president be authorized to address a letter to the commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, advising him that the exposition desires to encourage the construction of a Grand Army of the Republic building, and will furnish a desirable site and contribute such proportion of the cost of the building as may be found reasonable; also requesting the commander-in-chief to advise the board at an early date whether his organization would <choice><sic>hake</sic><corr>take</corr></choice> charge of the exhibit and what proportion of the cost of the building he could procure from the members of the Grand Army of the Republic, and how large a war museum he could collect.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">EXHIBITION OF WAR RELICS.</head>    
<p>Mr. Hitchcock spoke with a great deal of enthusiasm about this proposition, and his feeling was shared by the other members of the committee. He said he believed it was one of the best collateral ideas that had yet come to the promoters of the exposition.</p>
<p>It was suggested that it would be possible to collect one of the best exhibitions of war relics the country has ever seen, and that the Grand Army would see to it that a warm welcome would be extended to all confederate soldiers that might attend.</p>
<p>Major Clarkson, R. F. Williams and W. B. Howard, a committee of the commissioners appointed by the mayor for the Nashville exposition, met the executive committee to urge that the exposition association make an appropriation of $5,000 for an exhibit from Nebraska at the Nashville show and for keeping representatives there in the interests of the expositions here. It was stated that the county would be asked to appropriate $1,500 and the city $3,500.</p>
<p>Action on this matter was deferred because several members of the executive committee were not present at yesterday's meeting, and it was thought that nothing should be done without a full meeting.</p>
<p>Several of the members expressed to Major Clarkson, however, their doubts as to the advisability of making an outlay for the purpose suggested, and the major answered by declaring his conviction that for promoting the Trans-Mississippi exposition the same amount could not possibly be expended where it would do more good. A chance at Nashville to reach both exhibitors and patrons in the most effective way possible would be offered.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">NO SNAP IN THIS.</head>
<p>Mr. Lindsey brought up the question of the hours per day that department employes should be required to keep at the offices, and it was decided that their hours should be from 8 in the morning to 6 in the evening.</p>
<p>The department of promotion made a favorable report of the results secured by sending out circular letters through the business men.</p>
<p>Vice presidents of the exposition recently appointed by the governors of several states were formally elected as such.</p></div3></div2>

<p>LINCOLN, Feb. 2.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Something in the nature of a flurry among friends of the Transmississippi Exposition was noticeable this morning. Agents of the Kansas City Commercial club are said to be in the city to learn the exact status of the exposition bill before the Nebraska legislature. It is given out here that these agents will report to the legislatures of Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas and other western states the true situation concerning the Nebraska bill and if there be any ground for such a report they will say that Nebraska lawmakers are not in favor of an exposition and refuse to vote an appropriation for it. This statement is to be taken as the basis for an announcement, it is said, that Kansas City stands ready to pledge $1,000,000 cash as a bonus to be paid on demand to the Transmississippi Commercial congress, on condition that the exposition be relocated at Kansas City, and that the money be devoted to exposition purposes.</p></div2>

<p>MADRID, Feb. 1.&#8212;(New York World Cablegram&#8212;Special Telegram.)&#8212;El Liberal publishes lengthy statements from leading statesmen on the Cuban reforms. The most curious article is that of Castellar confessing that the present crisis in Cuba might have been averted if the Spanish liberal and democratic parties had devoted to colonial questions even a small part of the time their energies were absorbed in domestic affairs in Spain, and if they had not listened too long to those who always affected to believe every progressive democratic reform in the colonies implied a step toward secession. He admits if Spain had acted so after the peace of Zangon in 1878, or had followed the advice of Minister to the Colonies Maura in 1894, it would not have now to undertake them all at once under pressure of irresistible events and the demands of public opinion eager for peace. In Spain, after the colonial reforms of 1891, Castellar told the government: "You have sent to Cuba considerable forces, send them now a little of justice."</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">NEBRASKA FOR THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>Steele City Standard: From all over the world come reports of the interest taken in the Transmississippi Exposition, to be held at Omaha, June 1 to November 1, 1898. How much more, then, should every dweller in Nebraska be interested in it. Every business or social letter written should contain some mention of it; every visitor from another state should be given pointers as to its magnitude and magnificence; no visit to another state should be made without a pocketful of information concerning it. Enthusiasm is contagious, and no loyal Nebraskan will let this opportunity pass to show by his fervency and zeal in the exploiting of the exposition his abiding faith in the ability of his fellow citizens to make a brilliant success of a gigantic undertaking. Stand up for Nebraska by standing up for the exposition.</p>
<p>Gandy Pioneer: Governor Holcomb in his message to the state legislature, recommends a liberal appropriation to the Transmississippi Exposition, to be held at Omaha from June 1 to November 1, 1898. In the opinion of the Pioneer, the governor takes the proper stand on this question. It is expected that our sister states will appropriate funds for an exhibit, and it certainly would not do for Nebraska to set them an example of niggardliness. It is true that Nebraska is not in a position to throw money away, but it is also true that this exposition will benefit the state as a whole. Some of the legislators are taking the stand that this exposition will benefit Omaha only, and are therefore against any appropriation. We think they are wrong on this point; Nebraska needs immigration, and showing our products is the way to get it. We, therefore, hope the legislature will follow the recommendation of the governor.</p>
<p>Falls City Populist: A bill has been introduced into the Nebraska legislature asking for an appropriation of $350,000 for the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha in 1898. Many of our reform people are talking against making the appropriation, owing to the extreme poverty of our people, the heavy indebtedness of the state, and the reason that the exposition is an Omaha enterprise. If it is an Omaha enterprise, as many aver, and they have had the enterprise and financial self-denial to put $500,000 into an exposition that has already commanded over $200,000 from the United States government, and cannot prove a success without benefiting every farmer, mechanic, artisan, tradesman, laborer, and professional man&#8212;every man, woman and child&#8212;within the limits of this state, our legislature will surely not reflect credit upon themselves, their constituency or the great cause of monetary and industrial reform which we represent, one of the greatest objects of which is to get into circulation among the great masses of our people, who have labor, the product of labor and land to sell, the millions of dollars which would be brought to and expended in our state, on our railroad and transportation lines, hotels and restaurants, to say nothing of the hundreds of thousands of dollars that will be attracted to our state and invested in our cheap farms and deserted lands of the west and northwest that could never have been brought here by other means.</p>
<p>By the liberal and commendable action of our monetary reform legislature, which is looked upon with a jealous eye by our political enemies, we shall win to our party and the reform ideas we represent, honors which will stay with us and benefit us for years to come, while a reverse action will bring odium and disgrace to our party which will take years to overcome and result in serious loss to our God-given principles of monetary reform and true American independence. We hope every true reformer of our state, who seeks financial relief for our people in a liberal appropriation to the Transmississippi Exposition, will hasten to write to or otherwise inform our representatives and senators that they will surely do more for the immediate relief of the financial distress of our people in voting a liberal appropriation with proper safeguards for its expenditure than by any other measures that can now be devised by our people for their own relief, as over six million dollars will be brought to this state within the coming two years if the financial encouragement from all sources is what we now have every reason to believe it will be. Our representatives want to know the wishes of their constituency, and you should let them know your wishes, as an intelligent taxpayer, at once, that they may act intelligently and in accord, with the wishes of the majority.</p>
<p>The Populist will be found first, last and all the time, demanding and fighting for a liberal appropriation from our state legislature for this commendable enterprise for the millions of money that will result from the appropriation. This position is prompted by self-preservation, which is the first law of nature.</p>
<p>Nebraska Farmer: When the legislature comes to weight the proposed appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition in the balance it is not very apt to be found wanting, and still we think a good liberal appropriation by the state for the exposition would be one of the best possible investments from a purely business standpoint that could be made. It is Nebraska's chance to do the right thing before the world.</p>
<p>Platte County Times: The Transmississippi Exposition should receive prompt <choice><sic>indorsement</sic><corr>endorsement</corr></choice> and a liberal appropriation from our legislature. Every citizen of this state who is a loyal Nebraskan, is personally interested in the success of this enterprise. It is a laudable undertaking. Omaha is bearing the brunt of the battle and expense. May her harvest be a hundred fold. The great metropolis is in Nebraska. We are proud of her vim, and push, and energy, and grit. They are Nebraskans. So are we. The entire state will reap untold benefits from the exposition. let our legislators set the pace. The other states will promptly fall in.</p>    
<p>Minden Gazette: Every citizen of Nebraska who cares anything for his home or his business ought to be in favor of the Transmississippi Exposition, and if he has any influence with the legislature he ought to exert it for the appropriation asked. This will be Nebraska's opportunity, and the pessimists and growlers should be kicked to the rear and kept there.</p>
<p>Surprise Herald: The Transmississippi Exposition is receiving attention from all parts of our state, and well it should, for it is of more importance to our state than any other measure that is before the people. A good liberal appropriation and a hard pull and a pull all together by our people, and Nebraska will receive such a benefit from the exposition that when the year 1898 goes to sleep our whole people will say "God bless the exposition." It will bring life, people, money and prosperity to Nebraska and should be helped along by every one, regardless of politics, religions, sex or caste.</p>
<p>Omaha Trade Exhibit: The question is not so much "Can Nebraska afford to make a liberal appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition," but "Can Nebraska afford to not make a liberal appropriation." If we expect sister states to do the right thing by the Exposition our own state must set the example. More benefit will certainly accrue to Nebraska from the Exposition than to any other state, and it therefore behooves her to not be parsimonious. The general government has done well with an appropriation of $200,000 (which will probably be increased to $275,000) for a government exhibit, and Nebraska should do as well to properly show her resources to the world, especially when the money will all be put in circulation right at home and bring millions of more money here to be spent with it. Nothing will do as much to attract attention to our beet sugar, chicory and irrigation interests and bring capital to develop them as well the Exposition. Thousands of men with money and representing financial syndicates looking for opportunities to invest will visit the Exposition, and this will be Nebraska's opportunity to secure them.

<head type="sub">WILL GET IT ALL BACK.</head>
<p>Ord, Neb., Jan. 30.&#8212;Your correspondent approached W. A. Anderson of this city with the question, "Should the legislature of Nebraska make a liberal appropriation for the Trans-Mississippi exposition?" who answered by saying, "Yes I think the legislature should either make a liberal appropriation or none. I should say not less than $200,000 should be the amount if a creditable showing is to be made by our state. It we are parsimonious in this matter, other states of the Trans-Mississippi country will be the same. This is, or should be, a matter of pride to every citizen of the state. By all means let us make this exposition a grand success."</p>
<p>Mr. W. A. Anderson is a silver man, and was president of the bimetallic club of this city during the last campaign. He is a teacher and farmer, and has the best interests of his county and state at heart.</p>

<pb n="55" xml:id="TMISB02-055"/> 



<p>G. W. Milford would have the state legislature make an appropriation of not less than $250,000 for the Omaha exposition. Mr. Milford says that much was sent out here in the dry years, and we got the benefit of it. He further says, "Omaha didn't kick, and now why should we go back on something which is sure to be a lasting benefit to us, simply because Omaha will get her share of the benefit?" Mr. Milford is a dry goods merchant, and does the largest business of that kind in the city. He says, "Suppose some people do go to Omaha and spend a few dollars. We can't expect to have the whole world with a fence around it, and we are sure to get our share of the benefit." L. D. Bailey, one of Ord's general merchants, and who does fully his share of the business, says, "By all means the state legislature should make a good liberal appropriation for this grand enterprise. It is something that will prove of benefit to us for years to come, and we should do all in our power to make it a success."</p>
<p>Peter Mortensen, president of the First National bank of this city, says an appropriation should be made which will uphold the dignity of our state. William McNutt, a prominent farmer and stock man of this county, says $200,000 is none too small an amount to give for the benefit of this exposition. When asked what he thought about the state making an appropriation for the exposition at Omaha in '98 Sheriff Smith said, "Well, I think they should by all means make an effort to make the exposition a success, and an enterprise of that kind requires money, and I think the state can well afford to do her share toward furnishing it." Ben Bridgford, our leading drug man, said, "If the state legislature doesn't make a sufficient appropriation to the exposition to uphold the pride of the state I shall be much disappointed in Nebraskans." In fact the consensus of public opinion in this city seems to be that an appropriation should be made, and that it should not be a stingy one, either. Opinion seems to be that it should range from $200,000 to $500,000. We only found one business man in town who would not approve a liberal appropriation. All seem to be united, populists and republicans alike, that the exposition should be made a success. We have talked with many farmers, and have not yet found one opposed to making an appropriation, and as a general thing, the heaviest taxpayers are the most enthusiastic about the matter. One business man said, "Why, I pay from $600 to $800 taxes a year, and I don't care if they appropriate $500,000. I will get the worth of my share of the money. We must make this thing a success."</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">MAKE IT LIBERAL.</head>
<p>Hemingford, Neb., Jan. 28.&#8212;The World-Herald correspondent interviewed a number of citizens today relative to an appropriation for the Trans-Mississippi exposition. Without exception all favor an appropriation from $100,000 to $350,000. Some of the opinions are given below:</p>
<p>B. F. Gillman, rep., County Attorney&#8212;Nebraska should certainly be as liberal to the exposition as any state, and probably more so. I would favor an appropriation of at least $200,000.</p>
<p>Thomas J. O'Keefe, dem., Editor Hemingford Herald&#8212;Nebraska should certainly do herself proud in this matter. The exposition will be of untold benefit to us all. I sincerely trust that our legislature will pass the bill introduced for $350,000. The bill should be amended, however, to give representatives of the state full control of the appropriation.</p>
<p>Hon. J. W. Christy, rep., Capitalist&#8212;I am of the opinion that each Trans-Mississippi state should make an appropriation according to her wealth. Our state should give the exposition at least $100,000.</p>
<p>A. E. Neeland, County Superintendent&#8212;Nebraska should surely do her part in the matter of an exposition. Th people of Box Butte county favor a liberal appropriation and I do most certainly.</p>
<p>W. M. Copeland, Agent Burlington &amp; Missouri&#8212;The general government has been liberal to the exposition, other states are coming to the front and Nebraska must not be niggardly. Omaha has done nobly and I think Nebraska as a state ought to make an appropriation of at least $250,000.</p>
<p>Henry Lichte, dem., Farmer&#8212;I think we ought to make a big appropriation for Omaha; it is for the whole state. I want to see the legislature do the proper thing.</p>
<p>Eli Gerber, Stockman&#8212;They ought to put up $300,000. Nebraska is the banner state of the union. I believe in advertising and we have the opportunity of our lives right now. Our cry in Box Butte county is, "On to the exposition!"</p>
<p>William Forket, Farmer&#8212;I suppose the legislature will do as they please. It seems to me that $350,000 is a big sum, still I favor a liberal appropriation, say $50,000 or $75,000.</p>
<p>I. E. Tash, rep., Attorney&#8212;I am in favor of a liberal appropriation. Nebraska needs advertising. I think the exposition will be the means of filling up our state with an intelligent class of emigrants, who, as a matter of course, will be republicans, and we will then rid ourselves of this d&#8212;d popocratic dynasty that is being built up in the state.</p>
<p>M. H. Goodenough, Merchant&#8212;I am certainly in favor of an appropriation, but it does not seem to me that it is necessary to raise any $300,000 or $400,000. It seems to me that we have already been pretty well advertised, but it has been along wrong lines. I would be glad to see the present legislature make a good decent showing for 1898.</p>
<p>G. M. Goodenough, Barber&#8212;It's whole hog or none with me. If the great state of Nebraska can't give $350,000 to such an enterprise as the exposition she ought not to give a cent. We ought to all go and bury ourselves alongside of "Wooster of Merrick" if we can't pass this exposition bill as drafted.</p>
<p>Frank Cheeney, Farmer&#8212;Of course this exposition will make a great thing for Omaha; I can't see for my part what good it will do the state. If I was in the legislature however, I should vote for a good, fair appropriation.</p>
<p>C. A. Burlew, Banker&#8212;Yes, I favor a good liberal appropriation to the exposition. It is a matter of grave importance to the state and should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>H. L. Bushnell, Butcher&#8212;I think $350,000 would be plenty."</p>
<p>H. R. Green, Hardware Merchant&#8212;The exposition will be a great thing for Nebraska, and I believe we ought to see to it that this bill for $350,000 passes. Push it along by all means.</p>
<p>W. J. Bean, Druggist&#8212;Nebraska should surely give $200,000 at least. The position in which Nebraska is placed makes it incumbent upon us to make a good showing. I want to see this exposition a big success.</p>
<p>E. L. Johnson, Jeweler&#8212;There ought to be an appropriation, but $350,000 is a big sum now-a-days.</p>
<p>Smith P. Tuttle, rep., Attorney&#8212;Yes, I favor a liberal appropriation to the Trans-Mississippi exposition. I believe it will attract people and get them better acquainted with Nebraska, her resources and opportunities, and will stimulate immigration and add to the wealth of Nebraska from this source. Enterprises may develop therefrom, and it will be an advertising medium.</p>

<p>Indianola, Neb., Jan. 30.&#8212;In interviews with the business men and farmers surrounding this city the following question was submitted to them, to-wit, "Should the legislature make a liberal appropriation for the Trans-Mississippi exposition?" To which the following answers were received:</p>
<p>G. W. Short, grocer, rep. Yes. The legislature should appropriate $400,000. It will be the greatest thing for Nebraska that could be secured.</p>
<p>A. H. Reynolds, farmer, rep. Not in favor of appropriation anything. The state disgraced itself in last election, and the pop. legislature should be permitted to complete the ruin by withholding all appropriations.</p>

<div2 type="article"><dateline>THE WORLD-HERALD: OMAHA, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 1. 1897.</dateline>
    <head type="main">A GREAT PUBLIC INTEREST.</head>
<p>In the discussion in the Nebraska state senate on Thursday of last week Senator Ransom spoke against a beet sugar bounty. While Senator Ransom was speaking Senator Conaway (who, by the way, is a good friend of the exposition) asked Ransom what was the difference between making an appropriation for a sugar factory and for "an exposition at Omaha?"</p>
<p>At that time the senate had under consideration Senator Ransom's motion to indefinitely postpone the Spencer resolution relative to the payment of the bounty on sugar beets and Mr. Ransom was closing the debate on his motion when Senator Conaway asked Senator Ransom the following question: "If you are opposed to the taxation of the people for the payment of a bounty on beet sugar, how can you demand a tax upon the whole people for an exposition which will benefit the people of Omaha alone?" Answering this question, Senator Ransom said: "I am not surprised at the question of the senator from York. I am not surprised to receive a convert threat to oppose the exposition appropriation unless I shape my course here to meet every senator's ideas on some other measure. I want to say to the senator from York and to the other members of the senate in answer to this question that the Trans-Mississippi exposition is a gigantic enterprise and is more than a local affair. It is not an Omaha exposition nor is it a Nebraska exposition solely. That enterprise is designed not only to have represented in Nebraska the great resources of the Trans-Mississippi states but the resources of the different states and territories of the union, and more than this, the great nations of the world will, by their people and their resources, be represented at that exposition. This will all be done on Nebraska soil. This will be done at the metropolis of this state. At that exposition Nebraska must be fitly represented. She has been slandered and maligned by a venal press and by corrupt political motives.</p>
<p>"This exposition will afford not to Omaha but to the whole people of the state an opportunity to show the world what kind of people inhabit her borders. It will show them a great people in a state of great agricultural resources. It will show these people to be a sturdy, honest yeomanry, against whom no word of reproach can be said because of the political ideas that flourish here; it will be a great opportunity for Nebraska and her people. It will advertise her to the whole world. I t will most benefit her, it will place her in the right light before the people of the east. It will benefit the people of the farm and those who own land in this state. It will justify the statements of Senator Allen in reply to the speech of Senator Hoar relative to the people of this state. It will be the exposition of Nebraska. It will bring hundreds of thousands of people within our borders, and when they once see the plains of this state as fertile fields many of them will remain here and locate with us.</p>
<p>The Trans-Mississippi is the garden of the world. It contains the most enterprising people of the world. The mountain states contain the mineral of the world. This exposition will bring all the people of these states together on Nebraska soil. It will unite them as one in interest.</p>
    <p>They will become more closely allied. They will become acquainted and join in many enterprises. Great things will come to this state and the Trans-Mississippi country from this enterprise and Nebraska&#8212;not Omaha&#8212;will be the cause of it, and all the people of the state and all who own property will be benefited by it. This enterprise, if encouraged by a proper appropriation, will show forth in a splendid manner the people of Nebraska, their energy, enterprise and character. It will forever refute the slander heaped upon her and upon her people and will give to the state a reputation of which we will be justly proud. It calls for patriotic action on the part of this legislature. Every citizen should take a pride in the exposition. This is no time for politics or for politicians. This is a time when selfishness should be laid aside and principle should be supported for the sake of principle. This is a Nebraska enterprise and to attempt to make it an Omaha affair, dependent wholly upon the people of that city, is unjust, is not patriotic and does not do justice to the people who seek to make such an insinuation against the exposition. It is far different to tax the people of this state to pay a bounty on sugar from what it is to tax them for this exposition, which will benefit to the whole state. Every year we tax all of the people of this state to maintaining the state university. There are only a few of the youths of this state who can attend the university. Why is it we tax the rich and poor of this state to maintain this university? The man who mixes mortar and owns a home is taxed, and though he has boys who would like to attend the university he is unable to send them. The rich man without children is likewise taxed for this institution, and I ask the senator from York why it is the case? He knows that such is the case because it is to the interest of the state that education should be encouraged. That it gives standing, character and firmness to our people. In our high schools of today there are many evidences of the skill of the youth of this state. There are many machines of the most intricate kind to be found there. In our university maybe found almost an exposition in itself. These are the results of taxing all the people to educate those who would strive for it. It is worth the tax, it is for the people. It would be so with this great exposition. It  will show forth the arts and sciences of the people of the west, their enterprise, education and energy. It will show the product of her fields and her farms, her shops and her schools, and side by side will be exhibited the ingenuity of the great people of all the great Trans-Mississippi country, with exhibits from all the world to further educate the youth of this state and beckon them on to further knowledge and to yet unexplored fields.</p>
<p>"The sugar bounty is a private interest. The exposition is a public interest. Every person owning property in the state has an interest in the exposition. It had to be located somewhere, and the Trans-Mississippi congress decided to locate it in Nebraska. It had to be located in some city, and where, I ask, could it be better located than in Omaha, the metropolis of the state? The exposition did not originate in the mind of the senator from York. It was conceived in the mind of the greatest leader the American people ever had. That man was president of the Trans-Mississippi congress, and it was by his eloquence that the delegates in that congress from every state west of the Mississippi river were induced to <choice><sic>indorse</sic><corr>endorse</corr></choice> the exposition idea. That man was William J. Bryan.</p>
<p>"Now, I say it is our duty, since this great public enterprise has been inaugurated&#8212;an enterprise which will advertise Nebraska to the union and to the whole world&#8212;it is our duty, I repeat, to lend to it hearty support. I insist that I should not be threatened with the senator's opposition to the exposition because I do not favor a sugar bounty. this is not my exposition. It is not a populist exposition. It is an enterprise backed by the people of Nebraska and of the Trans-Mississippi region. The bill for its support is not to be logrolled through this senate, and if its fate depends upon my own treachery to the people who demand the repeal of the sugar bounty, then I will say that the exposition will have to take its chances.</p>
<p>"The exposition ought to stand on its own merits, and if it so stands, it will rise. The beet sugar bounty must also stand on its merits, and if it so stands it will fall."</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">WANTS SPACE FOR A PALM GARDEN.</head>
<head type="sub">Schlitz Brewing Company Will Exhibit at the Exposition.</head>
<p>Through its local agent, Otto Siemssen, the Joseph Schlitz Brewing company of Milwaukee has applied to the department of Concessions and Privileges of the Transmississippi Exposition association for space in which to make an exhibit. Mr. Siemssen says that the company that he represents will want at least 60x100 feet, and that in this space will be arranged a palm garden, in connection with which a restaurant will be operated. Plans for the exhibit are being prepared at the company's home office.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">JUDGE MAXWELL ON THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>A few days ago the World-Herald asked Judge Samuel Maxwell for his opinion on the exposition. The request was made without any knowledge as to how the judge stood. It was made, however, in the confidence that the venerable jurist would in his reply represent the views and desire of the people of the state, or at least of the Third congressional district, which has so recently and overwhelmingly elected Judge Maxwell to represent it in congress.</p>
<p>Judge Maxwell's letter is so strong and clear, and so happily expresses an unanswerable argument, that it should be read by all:</p>
<p>Fremont, Neb., Jan. 30.&#8212;Gilbert M. Hitchcock, Manager Department of Promotion Trans-Mississippi Exposition, Omaha, Neb.&#8212;Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of last evening, I will say that I feel assured that the exposition will be a very great benefit to our whole state. I am sure the benefits that would result from a successful exposition would far exceed the most sanguine expectations of its friends. Nebraska possesses a soil and climate unsurpassed by any state in the union. It is comparatively a new state, with its resources but partially and very imperfectly developed. We are moving forward, however. The great packing houses at South Omaha are constantly being extended and already are able to consume at fair prices all the fat stock that can be obtained. The great sugar factories at Grand Island and Norfolk, built in part, at least, by the liberality of the citizens of those cities, show that the very best quality of sugar beets can be produced here, and that with sufficient factories distributed at available points in the state Nebraska could produce sufficient sugar to supply the nation and more and pay into the pockets of our farmers the vast sums that are now sent abroad to pay for sugar. This is but one item. Chicory does equally as well as sugar beets. A large amount of it was raised in this county during the last year and was found to be productive and profitable. Tobacco also has been successfully cultivated in the state; the cost of drying sheds, perhaps, has prevented its general cultivation. It is safe to say that almost every product which may be raised in the latitude of Nebraska may be raised here. The common school fund, if carefully guarded, as is provided in the constitution will equal if not exceed that of any state in the union, and even now school houses abound in all the ninety-two counties of the state. And yet real estate is low in price. This is true all over the state and is caused to a great extent by the want of publicity of the richness of our soil, its great productiveness, and salubrious air and the advantages of the state. The exposition will bring hundreds of thousands of people into the state, many of them seeking homes, who, upon investigation, will be attracted by the fertility of our soil, the agreeable climate, our splendid common school system and colleges and universities&#8212;not forgetting the churches and places of worships. I have no doubt the exposition would be the means of advancing the price of real estate all over the state at least one-half and bringing into our state many desirable citizens. The exposition is not a local affair, nor would its benefits be confined to this state, but being located here this state must show its appreciation for the advantages to be derived from it by liberal financial support. The state itself can only make an appropriation through its legislature. A refusal to make an appropriation would be equivalent to saying to the general government and the various states that we do not care for the exposition, and cast discredit upon us; and some other state would take advantage of our mistake and secure the exposition. I have no fear, however, of such a result, as I am confident the practical men who compose the great body of the members of the legislature, while anxious to cut down taxation to the lowest possible limit consistent with good government, will regard the exposition with favor as calculated to advance our prosperity. But a small appropriation would have a depressing effect upon the legislatures of other states who intend to contribute to the success of the exposition. I believe an appropriation of $300,000 would within two years be repaid to the citizens of the state more than <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> fold in increased values of every species of real estate. Like the aid granted a few years since in the purchase of grain for seed, it would be twice blessed. It would bless the giver and receiver. Yours, very respectfully, SAMUEL MAXWELL.</p>
<p>The close of the letter is particularly striking. Who doubts that Nebraska made a great investment when the legislature appropriated money to buy s<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> for farmers two years ago?</p>
<p>The exposition bill is an appropriation to buy and plant seed for a great <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> of prosperity for the people of Nebraska.</p></div2>

I am proud that we have a large city capable of being honored with a large exposition, and I believe every dollar spent in Omaha will add to the taxable property of the state, to say nothing of the immigration we are sure to receive from the east, all of which will increase our source of revenues.

<p>Fremont, Neb., Jan. 28.&#8212;The following answers were received to this question: "Should the Nebraska legislature make a liberal appropriation for the Trans-Mississippi exposition?"</p>
<p>Judge Samuel Maxwell&#8212;I think the whole state will be greatly benefited by a liberal appropriation.</p>
<p>Mayor William Fried&#8212;That's my opinion.</p>
<p>Rev. F. M. Sisson, D. D., pastor First Methodist church&#8212;The eye of the nation has been and is on Nebraska as upon no other state in the union. By our legislature promptly appropriating a liberal sum for the "Trans-Mississippi exposition" it can best reflect the confidence of the majority of our citizens in our own resources as well we challenge the admiration and inspection of the entire country.</p>
<p>Rev. W. H. Buss, pastor Congregational church&#8212;In my judgment such an appropriation should certainly be made in the interest of the noblest development of the state.</p>
<p>Rev. N. Chesnut, pastor of the First Presbyterian church&#8212;Yes, anything that will awaken enthusiasm in the interest of the state will be very acceptable to the people.</p>
<p>Rev. C. Mugan, pastor Catholic church&#8212;I think such an appropriation advisable.</p>
<p>W. H. Clemmons, president of the Fremont Normal school&#8212;I think it would be advisable to do so for the future good of the state.</p>
<p>Dr. J. S. Devries&#8212;The exposition will afford an opportunity for Nebraska to let the world know something of the wonderful and as yet undeveloped resources, and for this reason the legislature should not hesitate to make a liberal appropriation.</p>
<p>Dr. L. B. Smith&#8212;I think so.</p>
<p>Dr. Nellie Bell, Fremont hospital&#8212;Yes.</p>
<p>Dr. N. H. Brown&#8212;One hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars for the benefit of the state, but not to go into the general fund.</p>
<p>Thomas Carroll, postmaster&#8212;Yes.</p>
<p>Miss Vesta Gray, attorney&#8212;The women all over the state are interested in the exposition, and I think the legislature should encourage it.</p>
<p>G. G. Martin, county attorney&#8212;Yes; a fair appropriation considering the present condition of state finances.</p>
<p>R. J. Stinson, attorney&#8212;Yes, a reasonable one.</p>
<p>F. Dolazel, attorney&#8212;Yes.</p>
<p>Fred W. Vaughan, attorney&#8212;The legislature should make an appropriation commensurate with the importance of the exposition, and I believe it will. It would be ridiculous not to.</p>
<p>Waldo Wintersteen, attorney&#8212;Yes.</p>
<p>E. F. Gray, attorney&#8212;Yes: I should say so.</p>
<p>R. D. Kelly, editor of the Leader&#8212;I am not in favor of any unnecessary appropriations at present from the state, but owing to the national importance this exposition has assumed, would favor $100,000.</p>
<p>Ross L. Hammond, editor Tribune&#8212;I favor an appropriation of about $150,000. Such an enterprise would, next to the encouragement of sugar production, be worth more than anything the legislature could do for the state.</p>

    <head type="sub">NEBRASKA FOR THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>Filmore County Democrat: There seems to be some little difference of opinion in the legislature in regard to an appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition, and we are indeed sorry to know it. This is not an "Omaha concern" as some of the members are trying to figure it out; neither is it a political venture to benefit any one party. It is a state matter and one that will affect the state from one end to the other, and the members who are fighting this appropriation should lay aside their narrow-minded ideas long enough at least to look at the matter in the right light. It is a question that Nebraskans, regardless of politics, religion or anything else, are mutually interested in and as such should receive the hearty support of every member of our legislature.</p>
<p>Hastings Tribune: We are disposed to think the legislature ought to do something to help along the Transmississippi Exposition, even if the times are hard. Possibly by the time the taxes are collected the situation may be greatly improved, and it may be the exposition may assist in the work of improvement.</p>
<p>Genoa Signal: Believing that the Transmississippi Exposition will be a good investment for Nebraska and the whole west the Signal hopes that the legislature will make a reasonable appropriation for a state exhibit and do it promptly. It will be foolish to expect the legislatures of other states to do anything if the legislature of the state in which the exposition is to be held denies it all encouragement.</p>
<p>Wayne Herald: The great Transmississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha next year promises to be almost a second World's fair, although there will not be so much lake water used. Every state in the west will be represented, as the different legislatures are preparing to make liberal appropriations for state buildings. Wayne should have her beet sugar factory by that time. There will be thousands of people who will visit the exposition who will also visit northeast Nebraska. Wayne's business men should have an eye to the future. If 10,000 people should visit Wayne during the five months of the exposition it would do our city and county no harm.</p>
<p>Valentine Republican: Much depends upon the state legislature as regards the success or failure of the Transmississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898. As the exposition is sure to result in great benefits to Nebraska the legislature should give the enterprise substantial aid and the Republican believes that the legislature could not advance the interests of the state more than by passing the bill now before it giving financial assistance. Already Omaha has and is doing her full share in this direction and the entire state should not be slow in doing its portion. If the bill is passed much of this tax will come from Omaha and Douglas county in addition to what money they have already raised. In advocating this measure the Republican does not expect to be rewarded by a portion of the benefits that will accrue to the state generally as a direct result of the exposition. Don't throw stumbling blocks in the way, but help the enterprise along.</p>

<pb n="58" xml:id="TMISB02-058"/> 

<p>Hardy Herald: The Nebraska legislature will cut considerable ice in the way of a reputation for its party in the size of its appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition. While a prompt and liberal appropriation to the enterprise might not meet immediate approval in the interior of the state, it would no doubt in the end be greatly to their credit. Everybody is an immigration agent and glad of any effort that locates a new settler, and the exposition at Omaha in 1898 would no doubt be a factor in that line never before equaled in our state.</p>
<p>Chappell Register: It is to be hoped the legislature will not be small in regard to the Transmississippi Exposition. There seems to be considerable opposition to it among members of the legislature who are against appropriating anything toward the same. If they defeat a liberal appropriation it will cripple the exposition to such an extent that it will almost ruin it. Other states are waiting to see what Nebraska is going to do and their appropriation will be governed by that of this state. This is an non-partisan measure and the legislature will be going contrary tot he wishes of the people of the state if they do not appropriate a liberal sum, in keeping with a great state, as it is.</p>
<p>Fremont Herald: Should the legislature fail in making a liberal appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition it will have failed to grasp an opportunity to give this state in general a big boost. The exposition must be made a success and Nebraska must make it so.</p>
<p>Wood River Interests: There is a disposition on the part of a number of Nebraska's legislators to defeat the Transmississippi Exposition bill or to cut the amount down t a mere pittance. To fail to make a liberal appropriation for the exposition in our humble opinion would be nothing less than a discredit to our people and an injury to the credit and dignity of the state. Nebraska's metropolis has been honored by being selected as the site for the exposition. Sister states are making generous appropriations that they may make a creditable showing. The legislators of Nebraska owe it a duty to her people to not lag in the matter of this great enterprise, but be ready and willing to contribute its full share.</p>
<p>Winside Tribune: Governor Holcomb has approved the Transmississippi Exposition and recommends that the legislature make a liberal appropriation for a Nebraska exhibit. Governor Holcomb has a long head. He knows that the exposition is assuming a shape which will do wonders for this part of the country. He knows that they providing of a liberal appropriation by the assembly is an absolute necessity to the success of the exposition. The legislature will do well to heed the governor's wise advice.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="main">LADY BOARD OF MANAGERS</head>
<head type="sub">WOMEN WILL HELP MAKE THE EXPOSITION</head>
<head type="sub">Executive Committee of the Association Approves of the Plans Already Suggested by the Omaha Woman's Club.</head>
<p>The plan for a Board of Lady Managers for the Transmississippi Exposition, as presented by the committee of the Woman's club appointed for that purpose, was approved at noon today by the executive committee of the exposition with some slight modifications, all members of the executive committee being present except Messrs. Rosewater and Babcock. The plan as presented by the women provides for a board of twenty-seven women, which is to have charge of all educational matters and all congresses on philosophical and scientific subjects. It also provides that the members of this board of managers shall consist of eleven women from Omaha, two from Council Bluffs, two from South Omaha and two from each congressional district in the state.</p>
<p>The executive committee amended the plan to provide that all acts of the board of managers shall be subject to review at the hands of the executive committee of the exposition, a section being inserted which provides that after each meeting of the board the secretary of the board shall transmit to the secretary of the exposition a concise report of the proceedings of the board for presentation to the executive committee for its approval. The provision in the plan as presented, to the effect that the congresses to be held under the supervision of the board of managers should be held "at some central point, presumably the Woman's building" was stricken from the report.</p>
<p>The section providing for the election of the members of the Board of Managers was amended to provide that the members from South Omaha, Council Bluffs and Omaha shall be elected at a mass meeting of the women of each of these cities, the members from South Omaha to be elected at a mass meeting held in that city, and the members from the <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>er two cities to be elected at meetings held in the respective towns, thereby giving the women of each town the privilege of electing their representatives. It was also provided that mass meetings for the purpose of electing these members of the Board of Managers shall be held Saturday, February 13, at 2 p.m., and Secretary Wakefield was instructed to secure a suitable place in each of the towns for holding such meetings, and also to issue a call for the meetings.</p>
<p>The manner in which nominations of candidates for election at these meetings should be made formed the subject of a prolonged discussion. Manager Hitchcock of the Department of Promotion suggested that unless some plan was formulated in advance the meeting would be in disorder and he suggested a plan whereby the name of any woman, endorsed by two other women, might be filed with the secretary of the exposition before the time fixed for the meeting, these names to be published and furnished to the meeting, forming a foundation on which to work, but not preventing the nomination of any woman in the meeting. This was thought to be objectionable and it was decided to defer action on this point until some future time. The appointment of a committee to formulate a plan was suggested, but no action was taken in this direction.</p>
<p>The plan submitted by the women and published in yesterday's Bee was then approved with the amendments referred to.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">THE OPENING WEDGE.</head>
<p>Falls City, Neb., Feb. 1.&#8212;The importance of the measure now pending before the legislature touching the appropriation for the Trans-Mississippi exposition is recognized by everyone, and it is interesting to observe the thoughtful expression of views that men are ready to make on the question, both favorable and unfavorable. Your correspondent has endeavored to touch the pulse of public sentiment here, and in so doing has obtained the following expressions from some <choice><sic>af</sic><corr>of</corr></choice> the leading men of the community:</p>
<p>Edwin Falloon, lawyer&#8212;By all means the Nebraska legislature should make a liberal appropriation for the Trans-Mississippi exposition. Nebraska people will be the chief beneficiaries. If Nebraska is liberal other states will be liberal. A successful exposition will do much for Nebraska. It will thoroughly advertise its great resources and dispel, if necessary, the silly assertions of the eastern press derogatory to our people.</p>
<p>W. E. Dorrington, capitalist&#8212;I am in favor of a liberal appropriation for the exposition. It will be a benefit to Omaha, and the state of Nebraska will share in the benefits. Every man in the state should take an interest in making it a grand success. If it should fail it will be a disgrace to the state.</p>
<p>M. Sickafoose, lawyer&#8212;I am in favor of a liberal appropriation.</p>
<p>A. E. Gnatt, lawyer&#8212;I would favor a liberal and reasonable appropriation, still, I would not think it wise to be extravagant. The work has been started and it should be carried through successfully, reflecting credit upon the state, and I would not regard it as simply an Omaha affair. Regarding it as a state affair, I am in favor of a liberal appropriation.</p>
<p>Charles Leister&#8212;I favor a liberal appropriation, because it will advance the interests of the state. As an advertising project, the money would be wisely appropriated.</p>
<p>C. L. Mettz, clerk of district court&#8212;I am opposed to the appropriation. It would benefit no town in the state except Omaha. It would benefit no laborers outside of Omaha.</p>
<p>T. J. Gist, banker&#8212;I am in favor of a liberal appropriation, because it would be a great advertisement for the state of Nebraska.</p>
<p>D. V. Stephens, Exchange mills&#8212;I am in favor of a $100,000 appropriation, and under the circumstances regard this as a liberal appropriation. Anything more would be a burden.</p>
<p>Sheriff Williamson&#8212;I am in favor of a liberal appropriation, because it will benefit the state and the west.</p>
<p>L. A. Ryan, capitalist&#8212;I am in favor of a liberal appropriation, because it will benefit the state and the west.</p>
<p>L. A. Ryan, capitalist&#8212;I am in favor of an appropriation of at least $200,000. It is a state enterprise, and our state legislature is justified in encouraging enterprises of that nature. I never had any use for howling, stingy people, any way. </p>
<p>Judge E. W. Thomas, lawyer&#8212;I have no defined opinion upon the subject, and will abide by the decision of the legislature.</p>
<p>W. A. Greenwold, merchant&#8212;I am in favor of a liberal appropriation, say $150,000, because I believe it to be a benefit to the state in general and Omaha in particular. It is a good way to show up the merits of the state.</p>
<p>Ed F. King, traveling salesman for W. F. Dolan, Atchison&#8212;I in favor of a $150,000 appropriation as being the best means by which the state can refute the libelous utterances now prevalent in the east against this state.</p>
<p>Charles Loree, county clerk&#8212;It is a good thing, but at a very bad time. I shall not complain at the decision of the legislature, whatever it may be.</p>
<p>A. G. Warner, druggist&#8212;If matters had not gone so far I would not favor a dollar being appropriated. But state pride demands an appropriation, and in view of this I would favor $150,000 going for that purpose.</p>
<p>Jule Schoonheit, county attorney&#8212;After going as far as they have with the Trans-Mississippi exposition, it would be a hard blow to Nebraska if it should fall through, or prove a failure. If the legislature gives the enterprise the cold shoulder it will undoubtedly make a "frost" of the big show. A penny wise policy in the matter of an appropriation will be costly economy to the state.</p>
<p>A. F. Hollenbaugh, business manager of the Dr. Holback Medical and Surgical institute&#8212;I am in favor of as liberal an appropriation for the Trans-Mississippi exposition as is consistent with the financial condition of the treasury and prosperous condition of the citizens of the state, thereby proving to the world that the adage "Stand up for Nebraska" meant more than a campaign cry for political effect; that the people of Nebraska are proud of their state and the beautiful city of Omaha, and that by a united effort of her people, backed by the legislature of the state, the Trans-Mississippi exposition will be made a grand success, which will redound to the lasting glory of one of the grandest commonwealths of the union&#8212;Nebraska.</p>
<p>L. P. Worth, merchant&#8212;I favor a liberal appropriation, as contemplated in the question, because the exposition will have a tendency to develop the west and show up the state to others, as we know it to be thereby counteracting the effects of the libelous reports now current.</p>
<p>Irving C. Marsh&#8212;I am in favor of an appropriation for the Trans-Mississippi exposition to be held at Omaha. The exposition will bring into the state representatives from the north, south and east, as well as the west; it will bring many into our state and we want to make as good a showing as possible, and if the state funds are spent that way there will be less for the banks to gobble up.</p>
<p>C. F. Reavis&#8212;I favor a liberal appropriation for the reason that, while the amount thus used would undoubtedly return with interest, the exposition would have a tendency to broaden the views of the people of Nebraska, enabling them to conceive of the greatness of the state, and this knowledge would profit immeasurably the people of the west. As the great World's fair acquainted the people with the world's greatness, so would the exposition emphasize the important features of the Trans-Mississippi country.</p>
<p>G. W. Marsh&#8212;I favor a liberal appropriation.</p>
<p>E. F. Houston&#8212;I favor a liberal appropriation.</p>
<p>W. C. Abbot&#8212;The legislature should make a reasonable appropriation. The exposition would further the interests of the state.</p>
<p>E. E. Sanders, merchant&#8212;Liberal appropriation should be made. Many benefits will be realized by the state by reason of a fair appropriation; the money would return.</p>
<p>Samuel Wahl, merchant&#8212;Favors a fair appropriation; the money would return.</p>
<p>A. R. Kenn, county judge&#8212;Favors an appropriation not to exceed $100,000.</p>
<p>Fred Brecht&#8212;Favorable to a liberal appropriation, Nebraska should take the lead in the movement.</p>
<p>G. W. Luskup&#8212;Favors a fair appropriation&#8212;just to the enterprise and just to the people.</p>
<p>P. S. Heacock, grain dealer&#8212;I am favorable to as large an appropriation as is necessary to make the exposition a success.</p>
<p>B. F. Morgan, grain dealer&#8212;If any appropriation is made it should be a liberal one, but not extravagant.</p>
<p>P. R. Lawrence&#8212;Liberal appropriation should be made.</p>
<p>Dr. G. H. Neal&#8212;Most assuredly, an appropriation should be made.</p>
<p>W. P. Fergus&#8212;One of the most important things to be done for the state is that of making an appropriation for the exposition.</p>
    <p>A. J. Weaver&#8212;I favor a liberal appropriation for an enterprise which makes Nebraska and her people the leading beneficiaries. Let Nebraska take the initiative, for upon her action depends largely the support of other states, as well as of the country generally. Considering the condition of the state's finances, and the general depression in business our legislature should be especially economical, and zealously oppose any wanton expenditures of money in needless and uncertain projects. However, to advertise Nebraska by <choice><sic>substatially</sic><corr>substantially</corr></choice> encouraging an exposition assuming national proportions, yet distinctly local because of its location, to induce capital to further develop our resources, and to promote a project that will <choice><sic>imploy</sic><corr>employ</corr></choice> a part of our idle labor, is certainly an act of wisdom rather than folly. It should be done by all means.</p>
<p>T. L. Hall, Lawyer&#8212;I am opposed to any appropriation; the people cannot afford it.</p>

<pb n="59" xml:id="TMISB02-059"/> 



<p>W. M. Hover, Photographer&#8212;Favorable to an appropriation; has no antipathy to Omaha and her interests&#8212;it will benefit the whole state.</p>
<p>A. A. Keller&#8212;Favors an appropriation. The exposition would be a direct benefit to all.</p>
<p>J. D. Spragins&#8212;The exposition should be reasonably encouraged.</p>
<p>W. H. Schock&#8212;I do not believe in going to extremes in this matter, but I am favorable to a fair appropriation. I think the exposition will be of incalculable benefit to the state.</p>
<p>G. W. Holland, Banker&#8212;There should be an appropriation, and I do not believe that the state would lose by being liberal in the matter. I believe that we need just what the exposition will do for us.</p>
<p>A. M. Priest, Manager of Creamery&#8212;There should be an appropriation.</p>
<p>W. D. Easley&#8212;If Nebraska wants the exposition there should be an appropriation.</p>
<p>M. W. Musselman&#8212;I am strongly in favor of a liberal appropriation.</p>
<p>W. W. Abbey&#8212;I am not certain that the exposition would be a permanent benefit to the people of the state. A limited appropriation should, therefore, in my judgment, be made.</p>
<p>H. C. Lopp&#8212;The benefit to the people generally to be derived from the exposition would not, in my judgment, justify an appropriation.</p>
<p>J. F. Clegg&#8212;Favors an appropriation.</p>
<p>Joe Miles, Banker&#8212;There should be $100,000 appropriated, or nothing, dependent upon thorough investigation of state treasury and condition thereof.</p>
<p>J. J. Tanner&#8212;The project is too far advanced to deny a liberal appropriation.</p>
<p>Al Resterer&#8212;I can see no benefits sufficient to justify an appropriation,</p>
<p>C. A. Hergisheimer&#8212;A liberal appropriation would be a good investment.</p>
<p>C. M. Wilson&#8212;Certainly, an appropriation should be made.</p>
<p>D. M. Watts&#8212;A reasonable appropriation would be a good thing.</p>
<p>J. W. Powell&#8212;I would like to see the legislature make a liberal appropriation. I wish to see nothing done unless it is sufficient to make the exposition a success.</p>
<p>George Gerhardt&#8212;Favors an appropriation.</p>
<p>T. P. Jones&#8212;An appropriation as proposed would be the best paying investment the state ever made.</p>
<p>Edwin G. Towle&#8212;In the midst of the hardest times that organized and civilized humanity have probably faced since the days of our Savior, it would be an act of inexcusable folly and extravagance to wring from a starving and bankrupt people any sum of money to gratify the vanity of the promoters of the exposition or to temporarily advance the material interests of the local city where it is to be held. If a "reform" legislature will not guard the state treasury then indeed the people are between the "devil and the deep sea."</p>
<p>W. F. Robinson, fair director&#8212;Yes, it is right to give all possible assistance.</p>
<p>M. F. Gamble, merchant&#8212;If Omaha wants an exposition, that is all right, let them put up for it. I can't see how it will help us any.</p>
<p>John Barker, barber&#8212;Yes, it's all O.K., and I hope to see it a success.</p>
<p>Francis &amp; Son, coal and lumber&#8212;A reasonable amount is perfectly proper.</p>
<p>J. Hewitt, justice of the peace&#8212;I am in favor of a reasonable amount being allowed, yes sir.</p>
<p>S. P. Mikesell, merchant&#8212;Certainly. I do not wish to see them extravagant, but Nebraska deserves, and we insist, that a liberal appropriation be made for the purpose mentioned.</p>
<p>John Mohr, furniture&#8212;I know times are hard, but this very enterprise will help to turn the tide the other way, and I favor a liberal appropriation.</p>
<p>M. Richards, deputy sheriff&#8212;Yes, you can say I favor the movement.</p>
<p>Huse &amp; Son, editors Journal&#8212;We are of the opinion that a reasonable appropriation is the proper thing.</p>
<p>B. De Sombre, jeweler&#8212;A reasonable amount should be appropriated.</p>
<p>S. Bittenbender, grain dealer&#8212;No, I think times are too hard for any such extravagance.</p>
<p>Dixon County Leader&#8212;Thousands in it. The state at large will not only be the center of attraction for the entire Trans-Mississippi <choice><sic>reigon</sic><corr>region</corr></choice>, but thousands of dollars will be thrown into the channels of trade of Ak-Sar-Ben range.</p>
<p>A. Bauer, implements&#8212;You bet; anything up to $100,000.</p>    
<p>T. C. Keefe, liquor dealer&#8212;I am in favor of it, of course, and think it perfectly right to appropriate a fair amount.</p>
<p>John Green, Grocer&#8212;You bet! Let them make Rome howl, we can't be hurt much, and I <choice><sic>an</sic><corr>am</corr></choice> in favor of taking all the chances.</p>
<p>Lester S. Logan, Meat Market&#8212;We favor all public enterprises and regard the Trans-Mississippi exposition as worthy of our best efforts.</p>
<p>Eames S. Learing, Grocer&#8212;We are right in the procession. While we object to extravagances, we favor a liberal appropriation and judicious application.</p>
<p>T. J. Welty, Attorney&#8212;Yes, certainly, they should expend $200,000.</p>
<p>Dr. J. W. Porter&#8212;I think it the best advertising scheme possible, and in line with the views of our best citizens.</p>
<p>G. Franz, Shoe Shop&#8212;Certainly, it is the proper caper.</p>
<p>C. Fields, Livery&#8212;I don't believe in being extravagant, but think a moderate appropriation perfectly proper.</p>
<p>P. Rush, Billiard Hall&#8212;Yes, sir; yes, we should not be niggardly. If we don't do the right thing it is our fault.</p>
<p>P. Morris, Merchant&#8212;I think it proper and right to give a reasonable amount.</p>
<p>E. E. Halstead, Bank of Dixon County&#8212;I think it a proper move, and our people should give it all possible encouragement.</p>
<p>J. J. McCarthy, Attorney&#8212;Yes, sir, it is all right to give a liberal amount, but the expenditure must be looked after.</p>
<p>G. L. Wood, Security Bank&#8212;In a broad sense it is of incalculable benefit to our state, and I am in favor of a liberal appropriation.</p>
<p>William Mahoney, Druggist&#8212;A reasonable appropriation is demanded, and I certainly favor the same.</p>
<p>J. D. Forbes, Druggist&#8212;Yes, sir; anything in reason, properly expended, is all right.</p>
<p>Wilson Bros, General Store&#8212;No; we regard it all right for Omaha, but fail to see how we are to be benefited, and times are too close.</p>
<p>E. J. Berry, Harness&#8212;I think it all right and favor a reasonable appropriation.</p>
<p>A. E. Barnes, Attorney&#8212;Yes, sir; I am in favor of the most liberal appropriation, and think it will be money cast on the waters to be immediately returned.</p>
<p>C. A. Kingsbury, Attorney&#8212;Yes, I do favor the appropriation, and think our state pride prompts liberality, and the benefits are innumerable.</p></div2>

<p>B. W. Wood, Editor Gazette&#8212;In this as other public affairs, we are in favor of doing everything that will benefit Nebraska or Nebraskans, and will say we favor a reasonable appropriation.</p>
<p>J. D. Stough, County Treasurer&#8212;Yes, sir; I think it the proper thing to do.</p>
<p>A. W. Rose, County Judge&#8212;By all means, yes; only let it be reasonable.</p>
<p>W. W. Cooper, Clerk of Court&#8212;Yes, sir; but let them be careful to select honest and prudent men to handle the funds.</p>
<p>Judge Norris, Attorney&#8212;Certainly I favor the appropriation. Let it be neither too <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> nor yet too narrow.</p>
<p>William Groth, Cigar Maker&#8212;I favor a reasonable appropriation.</p>
<p>J. E. Dennis, Barber&#8212;I certainly am in favor of liberality in such an appropriation.</p>
<p>William Ange, Hardware&#8212;I think it right to appropriate a reasonable amount for such purpose.</p>
<p>J. V. Pearson, County Attorney, Certainly; we should appropriate a reasonable sum and then see to it that it was judiciously expended.</p>
<p>Dr. J. M. O'Connell&#8212;Yes, sir; I favor a reasonable appropriation for that purpose.</p>
<p>Drager Bros., General Merchandise&#8212;We are in favor of a reasonable amount being appropriate for the purpose named.</p>
<p>J. M. Davey, General Merchandise and Stock&#8212;Certainly, anything in reason. That's our way of looking at it.</p>
<p>E. W. Gray, Jeweler&#8212;Yes, anything in reason.</p>
<p>Conner &amp; Kyas, Groceries&#8212;We are in favor of making it as large as the condition of public affairs will permit.</p>
<p>H. H. Hart, sheriff&#8212;I am in favor of it, and would say it was money will expended; but that's more than I care to say of the proposed cut in sheriff's fees.</p>
<p>R. P. Armstrong, grocer&#8212;I guess it's all right; haven't thought of it, but see no objections.</p>
<p>A. Beeson &amp; Co., grocery&#8212;I am satisfied to leave the matter with the people and the legally authorized body.</p>
<p>James Bigley, hotel proprietor&#8212;Certainly, let the band play, and everybody come and take a look at the best state in the union.</p></div2>

<note type="citation">Feb. 4th, 1897</note></dateline>
    <head type="main">Exposition Endorsements</head>
<head type="sub">BY THE TRANSMISSISSIPPI PRESS.</head>
<p>Glen Rose (Texas) Herald: While our state legislators are tinkering with the statutes and proposing constitutional amendments, it would be a good idea to pass a joint resolution repealing the section which prohibited a state appropriation for a Texas exhibit at the World's fair.</p>
<p>A Transmississippi Exposition is to be held at Omaha, Neb., during the summer of 1898, and Texas should be fittingly represented. This exposition is primarily for the states west of the Mississippi, and none of them have more to offer the home seeker or capitalist <choice><sic>that</sic><corr>than</corr></choice> Texas. Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and Missouri will lead all other states in visitors to this exhibition, and it is from these states that Texas is at present receiving the most new settlers. The Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas, the Rock Island and the Santa Fe give three direct through routes between Texas and Omaha, and the completion of the Kansas City, Pittsburg &amp; Gulf will offer a fourth. With a proper representation of her field crops, live stock industry, garden and fruit products, lumber interests, mineral wealth, and the low priced land from which they all come. Texas would receive thousands of new homeseekers from the blizzard-swept northern prairies, whose coming would be the direct result of our exhibit. Let the legislature act at once and many valuable features can be saved from the coming season's crops. On with a Texas exhibit at Omaha!</p>
<p>Denver Press: The managers of the Transmississippi Exposition which is to be held in Omaha next year, after considering the facts that the Columbian exposition added to Chicago's permanent population about half a million people, the centennial about 200,000 to Philadelphia, and that the New Orleans exposition awoke that city from a death-like slumber and that it has been wide awake every since, they have come to the conclusion that their fair will be the means of benefiting this part of the country in a manner at once extensive and permanent.</p>
<p>We believe that this exposition will attract a large number of people, anxious to know the resources and advantages of the far west, and that as big an exhibit as possible should be sent to Omaha from this and every other state in the Mississippi valley, and each of them should strive to make its exhibit embrace all of its industries.</p>
<p>In such an exposition, Colorado, with a good exhibit of her facilities for producing anything, mineral, vegetable or animal, corn or cattle, would easily rank high above the agricultural states, and lead the rest in a walk. A stranger seeing a good exhibit of her resources would recognize at once that Colorado was the place to invest his capital or build his home.</p>
<p>We hope, therefore, that the legislature will not fail to make an ample appropriation for the purpose of giving this state a good representation at Omaha.</p>
<p>Gettysburg (S. D.) Courier: An organized effort is being made to secure an exposition at Omaha. If the enterprise succeeds, and there is every reason why it should, it will advance financial and property interests of all of these western states. But it will be necessary to do something more than sit down and wait for it. To draw the people west there must be an exhibit that will pay the visitors for the time and money spent in coming, and such an exhibit will bring good returns to the communities that assist in the work. The date set for the opening in 1898.</p>
<p>Pacific Christian Advocate (Portland, Ore.): Omaha is beginning to count the people who are to come to the Transmississippi Exposition in 1898. From 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 is regarded a moderate estimate, and figuring that the average expenditure in Omaha by the strangers will be $10, business men of that city are hugging themselves in anticipation of the good time coming. We contemplate their prospective good fortune with friendly complacency, not unmixed with anticipation that their large advantage will inure to our small benefit. Doubtless some eastern folks when they get to the plains of Nebraska and see in the exposition halls that marvels of production come from these remote fields will push on to the continent's real El Dorado. As a western display it will probably be felt in our Pacific states that we cannot afford to ignore it, or fail to do our best to make a just exhibit of our claims to public attention.</p>
<p>Lyons (Kan.) Republican: The Transmississippi Exposition is the biggest advertisement that has ever been attempted for the Mississippi valley and the states beyond the Rockies. It is not a visionary, skyrocket scheme, but a well-planned and well-matured effort to give the widest possible publicity to the advantages offered in this section to capitalists and home-seekers who have money with which to buy land and engage in instrumental enterprises. The Atlantic Cotton States exposition turned the tide of immigration and capital from the west to the south. The aim of the exposition of 1898 is to set forth the advantages and limitless resources of states west of the Mississippi, and thus attract home-seekers and investors.</p>
<p>Oberlin (Kan.) Times: The Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held in Omaha, Neb., from June to November, 1898, will be the best opportunity the west has ever had to advertise its wonderful resources. Kansas should be second to none in her appropriation and preparation to take proper advantage of this wonderful exposition to be held on our borders. The officers are from the best business men in the western states. Charles A. Fellows, mayor of Topeka, is the president for Kansas.</p>
<p>Maryville (Mo.) Tribune: The Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha in '98 will be second in splendor only to the World's fair of '93 if the dreams of its promoters are realized. The government has already responded with an appropriation of $200,000 and to this the citizens of Omaha have added the sum of $250,000. All the states west of the Mississippi will be asked to make liberal appropriations from state funds to aid in making the undertaking a success, and Missouri, the greatest of all states seeking representation to the exposition, and the one most to be benefited by such a rare opportunity to acquaint the world with her unparalleled resources, should lead her sister states in liberality and magnitude of her appropriation to this the greatest exposition ever held west of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>This exhibition of the products of the unrivalled Mississippi valley must prove of incalculable benefit to our own states, situated as we are right at the very door of the exposition, and on the route over which must pass thousands of visitors from all parts of the globe.</p>
<p>Let us do nothing by halves in this great undertaking, for without working upon a broad and liberal plan our state will not reap the rich reward which is surely hers if she but grasps this opportunity to direct the world's attention to her rich, varied and marvelous resources.</p>
<p>Tabor (Ia.,) Beacon: The Beacon recently <choice><sic>give</sic><corr>gave</corr></choice> space to a circular letter from the Department of Publicity for the Transmississippi Exposition, the purpose of which is "to enlist the co-operation of the press in the effort to make known the scope of the enterprise and the advantages that must inevitably accrue to Nebraska and adjoining states" From the Omaha Daily Bee of January 16, in which the project is explained at some length we learn that the enterprise is in good hands, and that its consummation is assured beyond a peradventure. Subscriptions amounting to over $400,000 of the capital stock have been secured and congress has pledged not less than $200,000 for a government exhibit in 1898. Among the state exhibits Iowa should set the pace for her western sisters, and to this end the extra session of the legislature should make a liberal appropriation that Iowa may prove her faith by her good works.</p>
<p>Hoquiam (Wash.) Washingtonian: Perhaps the best method of advertising the great resources of our state, will be the Transmississippi Valley States International Exposition to be held at Omaha during the coming year, 1898. After the Chicago affair this will be the best ever held in the United States. Washington should be well represented there.</p>
<p>Grundy Center, (Ia.) Republican: The great Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha next year will be the most wonderful affair ever undertaken west of the Mississippi. All the states are taking an active interest in the exposition and will be represented by their respective products. Edward Rosewater of the Omaha Bee is manager of the Department of Publicity, and last week he gave a fine review of the plans and purposes of the exposition in his paper, The Bee, for a copy of which we are indebted to his office. Portraits of the officers and managers and a write-up of each state's resources are given in a minute and pleasing style that reflects great credit upon The Bee. The president of the exposition, G. W. Wattles, is an old resident of Carroll, Ia. where he spent most of his life in the profession of law and in the banking business. He went to Omaha in 1892 and is one of the most energetic and active business men in that city today. Iowa will do her part in the matter of exhibits at Omaha and will conduct herself in a manner that will reflect credit upon the state. Omaha seems to be the right place for the great affair and the enthusiasm and vim displayed by her citizens is just the kind of metal that will make a success of the exposition. We expect to be there, now that McKinley is going to give us good times again, and we hope to see all Iowa there. </p></div2>

    <head type="main">WOMEN AND THE EXPOSITION</head>
<head type="sub">CALL FOR A MASS MEETING TO BE ISSUED</head>
<head type="sub">Election of Eleven Women as Members of the Board of Lady Managers is to Be the Issue.</head>
<p>The call for a mass meeting of the women of Omaha to elect eleven women as members of the Board of Lady Managers for the Transmississippi Exposition will be issued tomorrow by Secretary Wakefield. The date has been changed from Saturday of next week to Friday. The meeting will be held in Creighton theater, Messrs. Paxton &amp; Burgess having donated the use of the house for the occasion. The meeting will be called to order at 2 o'clock and the business will be at once taken up. The executive committee of the exposition wishes it understood that this meeting is not to be held under the auspices of the Woman's club, but that every woman in Omaha who is interested in the success of the exposition is invited to be present and take part in the proceedings. It is also announced that the widest latitude will be given in the matter of nominating candidates for election by the meeting. Up to this time there have been no public announcements of the candidacy of any women for election as members of the board, but it is know that several candidates are being groomed for the race.</p>
<p>The meeting of the women of South Omaha will be held Saturday of next week, as originally arranged. Calls for these meetings will be issued by Secretary Wakefield tomorrow also. The meeting in south Omaha will be held in the Young Men's Christian association building at Twenty-fifth and N streets at 2 p.m., February 13. The Council Bluffs meeting will be held in the Royal Arcanum hall in the Beno block Saturday, February 13, at 2 p.m. The rules governing the meetings in Omaha will govern the meetings in South Omaha and Council Bluffs.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the exposition will meet at the Commercial club rooms at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon to receive the report of the committee appointed to engage the services of two engineers to recommend a site. The report of the engineers is still in the hands of the special committee. It was decided to hold the meeting tomorrow in the Commercial club rooms in order that spectators may have an opportunity of being present. At the former meeting the advocates of the several sites were out in force, but were required to remain outside in the hall on account of the limited space within the directors' room.</p>
<p>The question of opening the report of the engineers will undoubtedly be a live issue at the meeting of the board tomorrow. The conditions which caused the determination of the board to leave the report unopened for two weeks are substantially the same as they were at the time this action was taken. The legislature has made no appropriation, and this fact formed almost the only basis for the postponement. The Department of Promotion intimates that it has information to the effect that decided action will be taken by the house of representatives at Lincoln either today or tomorrow, and it may be decided by the board that further delay is inadvisable.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">The Chicago Engineers Believe It Best Suited to an Exposition Site.</head>
<head type="sub">Vote on the Adoption of the Report is Deferred Until Next Tuesday.</head>
<head type="sub">Title of Lands and the Securing of Fort Omaha From Uncle Sam to Be Considered.</head>
<head type="sub">Advocates of Other Locations Disappointed and Intimate a Prearranged Understanding.</head>
<head type="sub">Mr. Hitchcock's Suggestions Are Followed&#8212;Editor Rosewater Declares That the Engineers Have No Standing.</head>
    <div3>
<p>Messrs. Alexander and Schrader, the engineers from Chicago who were brought here to inspect the exposition sites and report their conclusions, have recommended the Miller park site. Their report, which had been lying in the hands of Mr. Yost, sealed, for two weeks, was opened and read at the meeting of the board of directors yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>There was a disposition on the part of some to proceed with the vote on the site, but after a long discussion it was decided to defer this until next Tuesday afternoon. Final action may not be taken then, but it is expected that it will be. At any rate the selection of the site will be the special order for that time.</p>
<p>The meeting yesterday was held in the Commercial club rooms in anticipation of the large crowd of interested citizens who would want to witness the proceedings, the directors' room at headquarters in the Paxton block having been too small to accommodate the attendance at the last meeting, when it was expected that the question of a site would be settled.</p>
<p>The large banqueting room was filled. About forty of the fifty directors were present. When the reading of the report, which was the first thing brought up, had been concluded by Secretary Wakefield there was loud applause by the promoters of the Miller park site, and, as was expected, both during and after the meeting there was on the part of some of those who had been disappointed the severest criticism of the report, the charge being openly made that it was foreordained and that it was a put-up job from the very first.</p>
<p>The report of the engineers was in full as follows:</p></div3>
    <div3>
        <head type="sub">ENGINEERS REPORT.</head>
<p>In this recommendation for the selection of exposition grounds the following points were considered as far as it was possible within the limited time allowed: First&#8212;The topography and general availability of the ground for building purposes. Second&#8212;Transportation facilities by street cars, steam railways and other vehicles. Third&#8212;Sewerage and water supply. Fourth&#8212;Distance from postoffice.</p>
<p>In the examination of the grounds for topography, dependence was placed simply upon inspection, as no topographical charts were submitted which could cover the ground.</p>
<p>In our opinion the Miller park site is the most available location considering all points. It is understood that the Fort Omaha grounds are included in this site. In regard to the topography of the Miller park site, it can be prepared for exposition grounds at less expense and will allow of a better grouping of buildings than any other site. There is a sufficient variation in elevation of the ground to avoid monotony, and the Fort Omaha grounds have many grown trees that may be preserved and made to conform to a plan.</p>
<p>It would be desirable to have Thirtieth street closed as a public highway within the exposition ground limits if the grounds lying both east and west of this highway are used. Should Thirtieth street be retained as a public highway it would necessitate a double line of fencing, each one-half mile long, and a separation of grades of roadways at one crossing at least. It would also completely separate the grounds, which would be undesirable.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WATER COURSES.</head>
<p>In regard to the development of water areas, we may say it is possible to a limited extent. Areas varying from seventy-five feet to 300 feet in width may be found along the creek bottoms by construction of proper dams and overflow utilized for irrigation purposes.</p>
<p>It is intended that the natural flow of the creeks shall be utilized as far as possible as a feeder to maintain water levels, and during the dry months of the year this supply should be supplemented from the water service system if it is found necessary. Although the water areas will necessarily be comparatively small in extent, they should be introduced as far as practicable to vary the landscape. Bridges of <choice><sic>artisitc</sic><corr>artistic</corr></choice> design can be thrown across the narrower portions and suitable shrubbery, etc., line the edges of the water areas.</p>
<p>The site may be reached by at least three separate street car lines, the Sixteenth street, Twenty-fourth street and Thirtieth street, provided the proper extensions are made to the grounds. The steam railways available for transportation are the Fremont, Elkhorn &amp; Missouri Valley, the Belt railway and the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha, all of them passing close or can be extended to the grounds, and suitable arrangements can be made for the handling of both freight or passengers. Trackage facilities for other railways can probably be arranged via the Belt or other lines.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">EASY OF ACCESS.</head>
<p>Although the distance to this site exceeds that to Hanscom park and is also greater than that to Riverview park from the city hall, we consider it as easy of access because of the greater number of transportation lines and the comparatively level roads over which the street cars, bicycles and other vehicles can pass at a higher speed and greater ease.</p>
<p>The carrying capacity of the several lines should be carefully estimated and efforts made to transport the visitors without unreasonable delay at either terminal.</p>
<p>Without a definite knowledge of the number and character of the buildings and grounds and the general scope of the exposition, and without a definite statement of the number of acres to be used for experimental or illustrative irrigation, it is impossible to estimate accurately the quantity of water required, but this may be determined later. This much may be said: That the Omaha Water company can supply a greater volume of water to the Miller park site under existing conditions than to any other site. Also, that any additional water service that may be required from the power station at Florence can be more cheaply brought to the Mill park site than to any other site, and all such expenditure will be directly in line for the future increase of the water supply of the city of Omaha. Any argument in favor of the sinking of wells to the water-bearing gravel connecting the wells and then pumping, will apply to all sites about equally.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">DRAINAGE FACILITIES.</head>
<p>A large main sewer, eight feet three inches in diameter, is constructed along Twenty-seventh street and has its northern terminus and outfall a short distance north of Fort street. This sewer at the present time has but few house connections, about five in number, and carries the surface drainage of a considerable area. It is thought that sufficient water flows through this large sewer at all seasons to sufficiently dilute the small amount of sewerage which at present is connected of sewerage <unclear reason="cut"></unclear> with this line.</p>
<p>Is it intended that the sanitary sewers to be constructed in connection with the buildings, toilet rooms, etc., shall be located along the right and left banks of the creeks a short distance from water edges, say fifty feet, and carried in this manner through the grounds to a point outside the exposition grounds, and there emptying into the creek bottom. These sanitary sewers may be small in size, say from six inches to probably eighteen inches in diameter, and can be easily arranged to have sufficient grade and water for flushing purposes. The depth of cutting, etc., can be reduced to a minimum. This method will intercept all sanitary sewers and thus keep the water in the artificial lakes on the grounds, a desirable feature, and we believe it to be the cheapest and most effective method of caring for the sewage.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">ACRES FOR USE.</head>
<p>The distance to the several sites as shown on the map upon street lines from the city hall is approximately as follows:</p>
<p>Miller park site, four miles; Elmwood park, four miles; East Omaha, three and one-half miles, Riverview park, two and a half miles; Hanscom park, two and a fourth miles.</p>
<p>Hanscom park site is probably the nearest to the center of population of the city of Omaha, and many residents could probably reach this site on foot, but the previous remarks on transportation we believe will hold good.</p>
<p>The Miller park site offers approximately 160 acres of public land upon which as many improvements of a permanent character can be placed as desired, and many of the improvements, such as roadways, paths, tree and shrubbery planting, water and sewer service, can be made of permanent use in the future development of the park system.</p>
<p>The Miller park site as offered contains approximately 400 acres, and will contain sufficient area upon which irrigation and all the varied industries may have full exhibit. There are some water service lines already constructed in the Fort Omaha grounds that may supplement any additional lines to be laid.</p>
<p>We hereby recommend for your consideration the Miller park site, and should this recommendation be approved it would be desirable to have a complete and accurate topographical survey made as early as possible.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">SECOND CHOICE.</head>
<p>The Elmwood park site is comprised within the limits of Elmwood park and the grounds of the Omaha Fair and Speed association, and, in our opinion, is second in availability. While the acreage in this site is ample so far as mere area is concerned, a large portion of the ground in Elmwood park is unsuited for exposition purposes, and should irrigation farms be made a feature of this exhibition additional land would have to be acquired for this purpose. For stock exhibition purposes the speed track and the various sheds and barns could all be utilized. Many of the other improvements could be used for various purposes, and thus make a considerable saving on the cost of the building. The steam railways could be extended, the many heavy grades would necessitate a heavier equipment than now in use on the Leavenworth street line. In this respect all the other sites would have the advantage over the Elmwood park site. The system of sewers would have no outlet except that afforded by the Little Papillion creek; in all other respects the system would be simple. The question of a water supply from the city mains cannot be considered, as the system was not designed to furnish water outside the city limits, and the nearest supply being a six-inch main at Forty-sixth and Leavenworth streets. The water supply would depend on the number of wells bored and the uncertainty of both supply and cost of plant is a very serious objection to this location. The available portion of the site is entirely isolated from the improved portion of the city by reason of the high rolling ground toward the east. The steep grades on the lines of the streets increase the discomfort to travel and should be considered in the selection of exposition ground.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">HANSCOM PARK SITE.</head>
<p>The topography of Hanscom park is such that only a very small part could be used for an exhibition building, and that only in the northwest corner of the park. This would not be a desirable location on account of the distance of the main part of the site, and would preclude the possibility of its use in this connection. We are thus forced to deal with that portion west of Thirty-third street, between Pacific and Center streets. Before buildings could be erected an immense amount of grading would be necessary, as the streets through this tract have been cut to grade and the tender of this site has been made subject to the condition that the grade of the streets remain unchanged. The cost of preliminary work would, in our opinion, be a sufficient reason for rejecting this site. No permanent buildings for the future use of the public could be erected, and this alone would be a serious loss to the city. The cost of preparing the grounds would be an absolute loss, as no money would have been expended on public property. Much can be saved to the citizens if the improvements, to a large extent, are made in the parks that now exist.</p>
<p>The street car facilities could be increased to properly care for the visitors from the business district, while its nearness to the residence portion would enable many to walk to the exposition. The steam railways would be unable to properly handle the freight business during the work of construction, as the tracks are located along the ravine which runs through the west part of the site, and would seriously retard the progress of construction. This is a very serious condition and would weight heavily against any site similarly situated.</p>
<p>The present water mains are probably large enough for ordinary exposition purposes, irrigation excepted.</p>
<p>The thirty-six-inch sewer in Thirty-fifth street would have to be extended southward from Leavenworth street to some point within the exposition grounds. Being within two and one-fourth miles from the city hall, the Hanscom park site is best located in only one particular, i. e., distance.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">RIVERVIEW PARK.</head>
<p>The Riverview park site is not well adapted for an exposition ground because of the extreme irregularity of its topography. The northern portion is extremely irregular, having deep ravines and narrow, tortuous ridges, rendering building operations impossible unless an excessive amount of work be done in grading. Much clearing of timber would also be necessary. The rough topography very considerably reduces the available building area and precludes the possibility of desirable grouping of buildings. This site contains but sixty-five acres of public park grounds and, consequently, a much less area could be utilized for permanent improvements in this than in Miller or Elmwood park sites.</p>
<p>No adequate water supply can be furnished to this site by the Omaha Water company without great expenditure in laying a separate main from the pumping station to this location. As stated in the report on Miller park site, any argument in favor of sinking wells and connecting and pumping from the same applies with equal force to all of the sites. There is but one well in this park at present. It was stated that it was 1,080 feet deep

<pb n="62" xml:id="TMISB02-062"/> 

and six inches in diameter. It is needless to say that this would supply but a small portion of the water required and undoubtedly would have to be pumped to the higher levels.</p>
<p>This location is reached by but one steam railway, the Burlington, located in the very lowest portion of the site, and no tracks could be carried into these grounds for construction purposes. Two street car lines may be extended to this site but, in general, the transportation facilities are not equal to those offered by the Miller park site.</p>
<p>We do not regard the East Omaha site as a suitable location for the exposition for the following reasons:</p>
<p>First&#8212;It is the sewer bottom land and monotonously level, the elevation of the surface being dangerously close to the high water line of the Missouri river.</p>
<p>Second&#8212;With the average high stages of the river the sewage could not readily be disposed of on account of the backing up of the river water in the sewers.</p>
<p>Third&#8212;It is not satisfactorily located to illustrate irrigation.</p>
<p>Fourth&#8212;Sewage should not pollute Florence lake or Cut-Off lake, and therefore sewers would have to be carried nearly a mile northward to empty into the river.</p>
<p>Fifth&#8212;There are no water service mains of adequate capacity nearer than one mile.</p>
<p>It is thought that the above mentioned points furnish sufficient argument why this ground should not be selected.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we would say that, while Elmwood, Hanscom and Riverview park, topographically considered, are perfectly adapted for public pleasure grounds, they are entirely unsuited for the special purpose you have in view. To properly grade these parks and prepare the grounds for exhibition purposes would destroy forever all the beauty in them that now appeals so strongly to the eye of the landscape engineer. Diversity in contour in the different parks is desirable. That is now found when you compare the steep rolling grounds of Riverview and Hansom parks with the comparatively easy slopes of Elmwood and Miller parks.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">MOVED TO ADOPT.</head>
<p>Superintendent Bidwell moved that the report be adopted and that the board proceed to vote on the site.</p>
<p>C. S. Montgomery thought that the adoption of the report would be the selection of the site, and so it was decided that the report should be simply accepted and placed on file.</p>
<p>Dan Farrell moved that the selection of a site should be put off one week, and this started a discussion and a debate that lasted for more than two hours. There were a few who wanted to go ahead at once with the selection, but the majority were in favor of deferring it, but they were divided as to whether the choice should be postponed until next Tuesday or until Saturday, and motions and amendments and substitutes were piled upon each other so rapidly that it kept President Wattles thinking to preserve a straight course.</p>
<p>Mr. Yost was the first to oppose any considerable delay. He said that the city council did not want to fix the park tax levy irrevocably at 3 mills until it was known where the location was to be, and the council was to bring the matter up next Tuesday night. He, therefore, thought that the site should be selected by that time. President Wattles also emphasized this point. A motion had been made to defer the selection until Saturday, and J. C. Wharton now moved to amend by inserting Tuesday. </p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">MR. HITCHCOCK'S SUBSITUTE.</head>
<p>Mr. Lindsey cautioned the directors against being too precipitous and taking what the people might call a snap judgement, and Mr. Hitchcock introduced a substitute in the form of a resolution as follows:</p>
<p>Resolved, That when this board adjourns it be to next Tuesday at 2 p.m., to act on the selection of an exposition site, and that the supporters of all sites be requested to present at that time: First, proof of the legal title and possession of the grounds; second, proof and specifications of the sufficiency of approaches, including both public highways and railroad trackage, and maps of the grounds offered; third, a bond of $10,000 conditioned to furnish possession and approaches without expense to the exposition and to guarantee the possession and unobstructed use of the exposition site to the exposition without expense; and that the site so selected by the directors shall be at their disposal whenever it is asked for, to continue during the exposition and until such time thereafter as the exhibits and buildings shall be removed or not later than April 15, 1899.</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchcock thought it would be very unwise for the exposition association to bind itself to a site before it was known that possession, undisturbed use and good approaches were guaranteed.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosewater said there were other reasons for not taking decisive action for at least a week. The engineers had assumed that Fort Omaha was included in the Millar park site, but there was no certainty that it could be counted on. The exposition could not get Fort Omaha for its purpose except by an act of congress, and this brought into the question a formidable element of uncertainty. The fort was in the hands of the secretary of war and he had been directed to parcel the site into lots and sell them to the highest bidder, and would probably have done so by this time had it not been for the bill to give the fort to the state of Nebraska for a military school. It was possible that congressional action might not be had on the matter of allowing it for exposition purposes for a year yet.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">CHIDED ROSEWATER.</head>
<p>Wharton chided Rosewater for dallying when he had only a few days ago published an editorial advising against delay and during the people of Omaha and the legislature to go ahead and show that they meant business. "Now let us go ahead and mean business," said Wharton.</p>
<p>Montgomery declared his opposition to the plan of deciding the site question Tuesday, thinking longer time should be taken, and as for deciding at this time he said that if it came to a vote he would not vote because he could not do so judiciously.</p>
<p>John L. Webster said he was confident that he was expressing the general sense of the community in saying that the site matter should be disposed of at the earliest possible moment and he was for going at it at once. Thomas Kilpatrick spoke in the same vein. He thought there was no good reason why it should be deferred longer.</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchcock again called attention to the substance of his substitute motion, and Mr. Webster challenged the essentiality of it. If the directors were not satisfied of title, possession and the like, he inquired, why were the experts asked to look at the sites at all.</p>
<p>Wharton here said that Councilman Christie, who was present, had leases for all the ground around Miller park that were good until 1900, and said they could be presented if they were wanted, and thereupon Christie marched forward and deposited the leases on the president's desk.</p>
<p>Montgomery observed that there were a good many Miller park people there and that they were making a good deal of noise, but that was no reason why a vote should be immediately taken.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">DENIES HE IS AN OBSTRUCTOR.</head>
<p>Rosewater now got up to deny that he was an obstructor, and to say that he was clearly compelled to give another and a very important reason why action should not be taken at this meeting. He then attacked the integrity of the Chicago engineers and the committee of the directory that brought them here. He said the report was foreordained; that the report as it had been read sounded quite like another <choice><sic>engineers's</sic><corr>engineer's</corr></choice> report that had been read in the city hall a few weeks ago. He had made a trip east to satisfy himself about these engineers. He found no on in Chicago who knew them. The city engineer of Chicago did not know Schrader. Prominent engineers of Chicago had told him that Alexander and Schrader had no standing as engineers. Their qualifications might be judged from the fact that they had advised that the sewage from the exposition grounds might be run off into the creeks in the bottoms. They were but ward politicians, who had caught on under one city administration and who would go out under another. Mr. Rosewater was, therefore, surprised that it should be contended that the site matter should be passed on in forty-eight hours. As for the city council, what was to hinder it from making the levy, and if it had once adjourned for a week it could adjourn for another week.</p>
<p>General Manderson states that Rosewater was right in regard to Fort Omaha, but he was sure that very speedy congressional authority for its use for the purpose of the exposition could be secured. He thought very soon after the 15th of March, at the extra session, but he was in favor of <choice><sic>proceedingly</sic><corr>proceeding</corr></choice> carefully in the selection of a site. He said he had not yet made up his mind, but he thought that by Tuesday a vote might be taken. It was infinitely better to defer than to act in such an important matter without the calmest deliberation.</p>
<p>The resolution of Mr. Hitchcock was then adopted.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">WOMEN'S ELECTIONS.</head>
<head type="sub">Meetings to Elect Managers From Three Cities.</head>
<p>In accordance with the provisions of the plan of organization for the bureau of education of the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition, a mass meeting of the women of Omaha has been called by Secretary Wakefield to meet Friday, February 12, at 2 o'clock p.m., in the Creighton theater, Fifteenth and Harney streets, the purpose of the meeting being to elect the two Omaha members of the board of managers provided for in the plan of organization.</p>
<p>The meetings in South Omaha and Council Bluffs will be held at 2 p.m. next Saturday.</p>
<p>All women interested in the exposition have the privilege of attending these meetings, and will be entitled to vote.</p>
<p>Replying to this criticism, it is declared, in behalf of the club, that the committee asked instructions of the directors, but received none, and was left to work out its own salvation. It had not time to await a general meeting of the club to approve its report, and so sent it direct to the exposition managers</p>
<p>Further, it is declared that the criticism threatened, as well as log-rolling for the presidency, are evidently in the interest of one candidate for head of the board of lady managers, for whom exposition directors' votes have been solicited.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">ROSEWATER CRITICISES.</head>
<head type="sub">Thinks Task Given to Women Beyond Their Capacity.</head>
<p>The meeting of the exposition directory yesterday afternoon was preceded by a meeting of the executive committee, at which the usual weekly reports were made.</p>
<p>In referring to the plan adopted for the co-operation of women, Mr. Rosewater said that as it had been settled it was not worth while to say anything, but he wanted to say that the plan contained many impracticable features. He thought that the men in charge of the universities and higher educational institutions would not care to submit themselves to the direction of women. The women might very well handle the common school and kindergarten exhibits, but trouble would come in dealing with the exhibit of schools of higher education.</p>
<p>The other members of the committee said that Mr. Rosewater was laboring under a mistaken notion entirely.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosewater thought also that the selection of members of the board by mass meeting would prove a cumbersome arrangement. He believed it would have been better to leave the selection with the teachers in the city schools.</p>
<p>The committee then proceeded to suggest a plan by which the elections should be held at the mass meetings.</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchcock suggested that each woman on an informal ballot vote for eleven managers, and that on the formal ballot the election be from among the twenty-two getting the highest number of votes, and that the eleven then getting the highest number of votes be declared elected.</p>
<p>This was adopted.</p>
<p>The mass meeting in Omaha will be called to order by President Wattles of the exposition association.</p>
<p>It was decided that in response to invitations delegations should be sent to various states capital to personally lay the subject of the exposition before the legislature. Messrs. Wattles, Lindsey and Babcock will arrange for the sending of these delegations.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><div3><head type="sub">PLAN OF CO-OPERATION.</head>
<p>The plan of co-operation adopted is:</p>
<p>Section 1. That the women be given charge of the sub-department of education in its various branches, viz.: The exhibits of the work of public schools, kindergartens, manual training and industrial schools, schools for the deaf, blind and feeble-minded, art schools, reform schools and all schools of special instruction, and that they also have charge of a series of congresses on various scientific and philosophical lines during the months from June to November, 1898.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That this sub-department of education be in the hands and under control of a board of managers of twenty-seven (27) in number, as more particularly specified in section 11, subject to the approval of the board of directors of the exposition; eleven (11) of said managers shall be chosen from Omaha, two (2) from South Omaha, two (2) from Council Bluffs and twelve (12) from Nebraska, outside of Omaha and South Omaha.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. That the local members of the board of managers be elected at a mass meetings of the women of Omaha; that the members from South Omaha and Council Bluffs shall be elected at a mass meeting of the women in each of said cities called for that purpose, each of said meetings to be called by the secretary of this board; the Omaha meeting to be held Friday, February 12; the South Omaha and Council Bluffs meetings to be held Saturday, February 13, 1897, at 2 o'clock p.m.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS.</head>
<p>Sec. 4. That from each congressional district in the state two (2) members of the board of managers shall be elected at a mass meeting of the women of each district called for that purpose<choice><sic>..</sic><corr>.</corr></choice></p>
<p>Sec. 5. That the congressmen from each congressional district shall designate where the said mass meetings shall be held, and, if desired by the women of said district, the board of directors of the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition will send a woman from Omaha to said district, to fully explain the ends and aims of the exposition.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. That the said board of managers may elect its own officers and adopt rules governing its actions.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. That two (2) women from each state outside of Nebraska be selected to form an advisory council, auxiliary to the board of managers.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. That the advisory council be selected by the board of managers from names suggested to the board by the different state federations of clubs and other educational organizations.</p>
        <note>The article on Page 62 continues onto Page 65.  It has been transcribed for ease of reading and understanding. </note>
        <p>Sec. 9 That the members of the board of managers and of the advisory council do not receive remuneration.</p>
        <p>Sec. 10. That in the work of the various departments and committees of the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition, where the services of women would be valuable, that they be asked to render such service.</p>
        <p>Sec. 11. The powers of the said board of manager shall be complete for the purposes above outlined, subject, however, to the approval of the executive committee of the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition, and to provide for this approval, the secretary of the said board of managers shall transmit a report of the proceedings of their meetings to the secretary of the exposition, who shall there upon lay the same before the executive committee for its approval.</p>
        <p>The mass meeting at South Omaha will be held in the Y.M.C.A. building, Twenty-fifth and N streets, and that in Council Bluffs at Royal Arcanum hall, Beno block.</p></div3>
        <div3><head type="sub">HANDSOME PROSPECTUS.</head>
        <p>The department of promotion has brought out a prospectus of the exposition and will distribute about a thousand copies. The prospectus is a tasty pamphlet filled with information respecting the exposition and of the distinguishing commercial characteristics of the western states. The front cover is a beautifully executed half-tone representing the west allegorically.</p>
        <p>A caller at headquarters yesterday was C. E. Wantland, general land agent of the Union Pacific at Denver and Salt Lake. He has from the very first been enthusiastic in his support of the exposition project, and is very anxious that the states of Colorado and Utah make liberal appropriations. He is doing everything that he can to push the enterprise along.</p></div3>
        <div3><head type="sub">COLORED PEOPLE'S SHARE.</head>
        <p>The colored people of the city are continuing their efforts for a department at the exposition. They will ask for space for a distinct exhibition. The following committee has been selected to confer with the directory as to plans and building: Rev. J. A. Williams, Rev. C. O. Owens, Dr. M. O. Ricketts, Dr. W. H. Stevenson, G. F. Franklin, Fred. L. Barnett, S. Cyrus D. Bell, George Collins, A. D. White, Fred S. Smith.</p>
        <p>The action of the United States senate committee in reporting the amended exposition bill increasing the appropriation to $275,000 and enlarging the scope of the exposition, is the subject of much congratulatory comment among the promoters of the big show.</p></div3>
        <div3><head type="sub">WOMAN'S CLUB COMMITTEE.</head>
        <p>In speaking of the exposition plan of women, as submitted by the committee of the Woman's club, it was stated that "a number of the members of the Woman's club are offended because the committee appointed by the club to propose the plan of co-operation went straight ahead, agreed on what should be recommended, and presented their report to the exposition management without submitting it first to the club."</p></div3></div2>

        <p>OMAHA, January <unclear reason="blurry"></unclear>&#8212;Everybody in Omaha is taking the Transmississippi and International Exposition of <unclear reason ="blurry"></unclear>. Leading men of the city and state have taken hold of the project with a determination to push it to successful issue. Its scope is being gradually unfolded and the people of the Western States are beginning to see that it contemplates an exposition of the wealth, productiveness and resources of the great West, and that it is not to be a local affair. It was primarily designed to display the capabilities of Western States, but as plans developed and broadened, and international character was given the enterprise and as such it received recognition at the hands of the United States Congress. The art passed by Congress last June, which immediately received the approval of President Cleveland, pledged $200,000 for the purposes of a Government exhibit, buildings and proper supervision thereof.</p>
        <p>The act provides that there shall be exhibited at the Transmississippi and International Exposition by the Government of the United States such articles and materials as illustrate the function and administrative faculty of the Government in time of peace and its resources as a war power, tending to demonstrate the nature of our institutions and their adaption is the wants of the people; that such exposition shall be national as well as international in its character, in which the people of the world shall be invited to participate. The act provides further that medals, with appropriate devices, emblems and inscriptions, commemorative of said Transmississippi and International Exposition and of the awards to be made to the exhibitors, shall be prepared at the some mint of the United States for the board of directors. Articles which shall be imported from foreign countries for the sole purpose of exhibition, upon which there shall be a tariff or customs duty, shall be admitted free of payment of duty, customs fees or charges. Regulations governing entries of foreign goods intended for exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition have been issued by Secretary Carlisle. The regulations are almost identical with those which were in force during the Atlanta Exposition.</p>
        <p>A bill is pending before the Nebraska Legislature providing for an appropriation of $350,000 to cover the cost of a State building and exhibit. Governor Silas A. Holcomb, in his biennial message to the Legislature, emphasized the importance of the undertaking, and strongly urged the members of the Legislature to promptly vote a substantial appropriation in support of the exposition. Senators William V. Allen and John M. Thurston, Congressmen D. H. Mercer and his colleagues in the House, together with the new State officers, are all working zealously to promote the interest of the exposition, both at Washington and at Lincoln.</p>
        <p>Bills carrying appropriations in greater or less amount have been introduced in many of the States and Territories west of the Mississippi river. A bill carrying $100,000 appropriation is pending in the Illinois Legislature. Iowa made a small preliminary appropriation and will increase it at a later session. The Louisiana Legislature authorized the State Board of Agriculture to proceed with steps looking to adequate representation, ample provision <choice><sic>therefor</sic><corr>therefore</corr></choice> to be made later by the Legislature. Bills are pending before the Legislature of South Dakota, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and other Western States and Territories. The exposition vice-presidents for these States report that satisfactory progress is being made with these measures.</p>
        <p>The people of Omaha and vicinity have subscribed to the exposition stock in the sum of $425,000 and are responding promptly to calls for assessments thereon. Stock subscriptions are constantly being made and the board of managers is confident that the citizens of Omaha will raise the total stock subscriptions to a sum exceeding $1,000,000 within the next few months. A bond subsidy to be voted by the taxpayers of Omaha and Douglas county of not less than $500,000 is in contemplation and will doubtless be accomplished within a few months.</p>
        <p>The working forces of the exposition are thoroughly organized and are doing most effective service. The active management is in the hands of a president and an executive committee of seven members. Each member of the executive committee is the manager of one of the seven departments into which the work of the exposition is divided. There managers were chosen from among the fifty directors elected less than sixty days ago by the stockholders of the exposition. The bill before the Legislature, carrying an appropriation, provides for twelve State commissioners, who must be elected as members of the board of directors in order that the State may have a voice in the affairs of the exposition. The Congressional act, as a matter of course, provides for commissioners who will have charge of the Government exhibit and building. The articles of incorporation of the Exposition Association also provide for a vice-president for each of the twenty-four transmississippi States and Territories, to be appointed by the Governors of the respective States. Those who have been appointed vice-presidents are as follows.</p>
        <p>From Iowa, George F. Wright, Council Bluffs; South Dakota, Thomas H. Wells, Hot Springs; Nebraska, William Neville, North Platte; Missouri, John Doniphan, St. Joseph; Kansas, C. A. Fellows, Topeka; Arizona, Charles R. Drake, Tucson; California, George W. Parsons, Los Angeles; Texas, Gustav Reymershoffer, Galveston; Oklahoma, Eugene Wallace, Oklahoma City; Idaho, B. P. Shawhan, Payette; Nevada, William J. Westerfield, Reno; Utah, Lewis W. Shurtliff, Ogden City; Colorado, Henry P. Steele, Denver; New Mexico, L. Bradford Prince, Santa Fe; Oregon, B. S. Cook, Salem; Alaska, Governor James Sheakley, Sitka. The officers of the exposition are: Gurdon W. Wattles, president; Alvin Saunders, resident vice-president; Herman Kountze, treasurer; John A. Wakefield, secretary. The executive committee is composed of the following: Zachary T. Lindsey, chairman and manager of the department of ways and means; Edward Rosewater, manager of the department of publicity; Gilbert M. Hitchcock, manager of the department of promotion; Freeman P. Kirkendall, manager of the department of buildings and grounds; Edward E. Bruce, manager of the department of exhibits; Abram L. Reed, managers of the department of concessions; W. N. Babcock, manager of the department of transportation.</p>
        <p>A plan for a woman's department is under consideration by a special committee appointed for that purpose, and some method will be adopted by which the women will be given representation in the exposition.</p>
        <p>The selection of a site for the exposition is engrossing the attention of the citizens of Omaha at this time. No less than five different sites are under consideration. There seems to be no division of opinion that one or the other of the public parks in and about the city shall be selected for the purposes of the exposition. Owners of property adjoining these parks have offered the use of their lands in conjunction with the park tracts. Miller Park on the north, Riverview Park on the south, Elmwood park on the west, and Hanscom Park in the southwestern part of the city, located nearer the center of population than the others, each has a strong party advocating its selection by the exposition management. Council Bluffs, whose citizens are no less enthusiastic in support of the exposition than the people of Omaha, offer a site at East Omaha, a manufacturing suburb half a mile up the river, where the East Omaha Bridge and Terminal Company has constructed a magnificent steel draw railroad and wagon bridge. The merits and demerits of the respective sites under discussion have been argued, publicly and privately, for more than a month. Partisans of each site have gone to considerable trouble and expense in the preparation of maps, descriptive matter, etc., exploiting their advantages and attractions.</p>
        <p><unclear reason="torn"></unclear>experts to view
            <unclear reason="torn">nd</unclear> report to the board its findings. This has been done and the report is now on file with the executive committee, along with the bids of the advocates of the several sites. The selection will be made immediately after the passage of the appropriation bill by the State Legislature. A landscape engineer will then be employed and the work of laying out the grounds will begin. It is said that active work on the exposition site will be commenced within thirty days.</p>
            <p>Plans for a few unique and highly attractive features have already been favorably received by the promoters of the exposition, as well as the people at large. One which has attracted much attention is the proposed silver palace, which will be the central figure of the mineral exhibit. It is proposed for this exhibit, under the designation of "El Dorado." The building will be about 450 feet square. It will be constructed of metal and will be silver-plated.</p>
            <p>It is proposed to house the various silver interests in this palace, fully illustrating the silver idea, from the mining and smelting to the illimitable ramifications of the arts, industries and finance.</p>
            <p>Among other features proposed will be an ethnological exhibit. Representatives of every Indian tribe in the United States and Territories are to be assembled in great numbers.</p>
            <p>In the mining section there will be reproductions of famous mines in miniature. The Mercur gold mines of Utah will be shown in this way, the exhibit to cover possibly an acre of ground.</p>
            <p>Trophies and prizes are offered for the best exhibit illustrating an irrigating system. The people of the East have no conception of the extent to which the people of the Western States and Territories have carried the science of irrigation. This department alone will afford a marvelous exhibit. Inducements are also offered for beet sugar exhibits and to exhibits pertaining to the culture of the sugar beet. Trophies and prizes are also offered for the best electrical exhibits and for mechanical exhibits in operation, etc.</p>
            <p>Omaha, the city of the exposition, was founded in 1854, and <choice><sic>to-day</sic><corr>today</corr></choice> has a population of 140,000. Within a radius of six miles from its Courthouse the population is about 180,000. Omaha is located midway between New York and San Francisco, at the initial point of the first great transcontinental railway. It is the business center of all that wealth producing country embraced in the Black Hills, for the coal, metal and oil regions of Wyoming, for the products of the great western ranges, for the rich agricultural plains of the Mis-<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> thriving towns and cities in the north half of Kansas, Eastern Colorado, Wyoming, the greater portion of Montana and South Dakota, Western Iowa and all of Nebraska. The aggregate population of Nebraska and the States touching her borders is nearly 10,000,000.</p>
            <p>Omaha has eight national and one savings bank, with a combined capital of $3,800,000, undivided profits of nearly $500,000, and total deposits of from $12,000,000 to $15,000,000. The volume of commerce of the city for the year 1896, as shown by the clearing-house reports, was $210,141,334. It is the principal jobbing center west of Chicago. There are 180 firms doing a wholesale business, having an aggregate capital of $10,000,000. Their total annual sales approximate $40,000,000. The business of its Postoffice amounted last year to $2,575,729. The collections of its internal revenue office for 1896 amounted to nearly $1,000,000.</p>
            <p>No city of equal population in the country has more or better public and commercial buildings. The United States custom-house and postoffice, costing $2,000,000, is rapidly nearing completion. The exterior of the building is finished. The superstructure is of Colorado pink granite. The interior is to be finished in marble and rich mosaic work. The grounds occupy an entire square in the heart of the city. The Government officials expect to occupy the building within the next six months. The Douglas county courthouse, another imposing structure, occupies an entire square fronting on Farnam street, the main business thoroughfare. It is built of cut stone, three stories high, 115x123 feet, surmounted by a massive dome. The City Hall is one of the handsomest municipal buildings in the United States and was erected at a cost of about $500,000. The basement and first story are of Dodlin granite, above which walls of rich Portage red sandstone rise. The tower at the corner rises 216 feet above the level of the street.</p>
            <p>Some of the handsomest and most expensive buildings in the city are the New York Life building, erected at a cost of $750,000; the Bee building, costing $450,000; the Public Library, costing $200,000; the Paxton building, costing $300,000; the First National Bank building, the Merchants' National Bank building, Brownell Hall, the Young Men's Christian Association building, the High School building, and many others. There are more than 100 churches in the city.</p>
            <p>While Omaha has an extensive system of public parks, the oldest resort of this nature is a most delightful retreat, covering more than sixty acres, lying in the southwestern part of the city. It was donated to the city twenty-five years ago by A. J. Hanscom, whose name it bears. It is a natural park in the strictest sense, and while the park commission has expended a great many thousand dollars in improving and beautifying it, yet it was a most enchanting place before the city attempted to improve it. Should this park be selected as a site for the exposition many acres of land adjoining will be used in connection therewith for the purposes of the exposition.</p>
            <p>Omaha maintains the rank of the third largest live stock market in America, and its beef packing industry has within the last five years assumed enormous proportions. The total receipts in 1896 were: 570,515 cattle, 1,197,638 hogs, 233,332 sheep, and 9653 horses and mules. The value of the product of the South Omaha packing houses for 1896 exceeds $30,000,000. The average number of men employed each day of last year was 3209, who were paid $1,621,697 91 in wages. The Union Stock Yards Company employed 250 men in addition to these.</p>
            <p>The manufacturing industries of Omaha are extensive and diversified. The largest silver and gold smelting and refining works in the United States are located in it. Their output last year was 10,900,000 ounces of silver, valued at $7,255,000; 273,000 ounce of gold, valued at $5,640,000; 32,000 tons of lead, valued at $1,656,000, and blue vitriol valued at $790,000. Thirteen railways converge here. Four great trunk lines furnish prompt and convenient access to all points <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> with the wonderful mining cities of the Rocky mountains and the unsurpassed fruit-raising valleys of California; another brings all the untold wealth of Montana to the gates of the city and furnishes a second Coast outlet in the Northwest at the very border of the British possessions. The wheat fields on the North and the cotton plantations of the South, with the Gulf ports, are in direct connection with Omaha through other great railroad systems.</p>
            <p>The highest aim of the promoters of the Transmississippi and International Exposition of 1898 is to show to the world the vast extent of wealth and resources possessed by the States and Territories west of the Mississippi river. From this region comes nearly all the gold and silver produced in the United States, and nearly every mineral known to commerce is dug from its mountains. Between the Mississippi river and the Rocky mountains lies the granary of America. Cereals of almost every description are produced in great abundance. The production of sugar in the United States is confined almost exclusively to the States of Louisiana, Nebraska, Utah and California. The cotton of Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas and Indian Territory constitutes one-half of the cotton raised in the United States, and its annual value is computed to be $161,000,000. The timber of the Pacific Coast States, Missouri, Arkansas, Minnesota and Texas is almost limitless in extent and variety.</p>
            <p>This magnificent empire, with its boundless resources, which have scarcely begun to be developed, already has 67,000,000 acres under cultivation, with agricultural products valued at $933,331,921 a year.</p>
            <p>The States and Territories west of the Mississippi contain the great wheat and corn belts, which in 1895 are credited with raising 1,100,000,000 bushels of corn, valued at $235,000,000, and 300,000,000 bushels of wheat, valued at $135,000,000. The transmississippi hay crop for 1895 aggregated 27,000,000 tons, valued at $150,000,000. The transmississippi country is par excellence the great cattle-raising ground of America.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most striking proof of the wealth and resources of the country west of the Mississippi is afforded by the statistics of live stock. The number of horses and mules in the States and Territories west of the Mississippi was computed to be 8,458,809, and their value is estimated at $462,639,621. The number of cattle is computed at 30,970,616, and their value is estimated to be $461,993,266. The number of sheep and hogs is estimated at 50,811,500, and their value $168,158,075. In other words, the aggregate value of the live stock and horses west of the Mississippi, in round numbers, in $1,091,890,962.</p>
            <p>The mineral wealth of the Western States includes practically all the precious metals and the bulk of other valuable minerals produced in the United States. The annual value of the gold and silver mined in the West exceeds $100,000,000. The production of copper and other minerals exceeds in value the gold and silver product. The vast coal beds, which for the most part are lying dormant, produce an aggregate of 20,000,000 tons a year, valued at from $25,000,000 to $30,000,000.</p>
            <p>The country west of the Mississippi is rapidly extending its manufacturing capacity. According to the most conservative estimates, the number of operatives in mills and factories exceeds 200,000, earning in wages over $75,000,000 a year. The value of the product of these factories and mills is computed at $1,367,835,987.</p>
            <p>With an assessed valuation of real and personal property aggregating over $6,000,000,000, which represents less than one-fourth of actual property values, the lowest estimate of the aggregate wealth of the transmississippi States and Territories is $20,000,000,000.</p>
            <p>The marvelous strides made in the development of the transmississippi region are chiefly due to the construction of railroads. In 1869 there were only 2100 miles of railroad west of the Mississippi and only twenty-six and one-half west of the Missouri. In 1889 the railroad mileage west of the Mississippi was 62,612 miles. In 1896 it had reached 79,705 miles and before the close of the present year it will exceed 80, <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> has kept pace with the material growth is evident by the fact that in 1879 the population west of the Mississippi was 6,495,167, and by 1890 it had reached 15,170,215, a growth of 250 per cent in twenty years. At the close of 1896 the estimated population west of the Mississippi was 20,128,260. The basis of this estimate is the vote in the last two Presidential elections. In 1892 the total vote for President was 3,199,788, and in 1896 the total vote for President was 3,983,786.</p>
            <p>As a factor in the educational exhibit in the exposition of 1898 the States west of the Mississippi will be able to furnish a striking object lesson. They have 121 universities and colleges, and the number of schoolhouses exceeds 62,000. The school population exceeds 5,7000,000.</p></div2>

<head type="main">A DAMASCUS NIGHT&#8212;BY CLINTON SCOLLARD.</head>
<ab>(Copyright, 1897, by Clinton Scollard.)</ab>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">Part I.</head>
<p>IT was the 9th of July, 1860. The declining afternoon was sultry, and there was scarcely a breath of air stirring in the poplar trees. I was sitting with my friend Vitelis in one of the Barada gardens, sipping sherbet and smoking a chibouk, when my attention was attracted by the uproar. A zither player, who was squatting upon one of the elevated <unclear reason="cut off">ands</unclear> had just ceased playing.</p>
<p>"There must be a quarrel in one of the <choice><sic>bazars</sic><corr>bazaars</corr></choice>," said Vitelis lazily.</p>
<p>"I pray that it be none of our people," I answered.</p>
<p>"One of those troublesome Druses, more likely."</p>
<p>"I do not fancy the presence of those turbulent fellows in the city. They are ever bent upon making trouble."</p>
        <p>Just then there was the report of a <unclear reason="cut off">an</unclear> or pistol, followed by a series of piercing cries. Both of us started to our feet. Never in our previous experience had such a thing happened. What could it mean?</p>
        <p>"We had best look into this," Vitelis said, and together we hastened toward the entrance to the garden. As we emerged upon the highway leading to <unclear reason="cut off">almyra</unclear> we encountered a camel driver with his laden beast. The man was a denizen of the desert, lean and forbidding featured.</p>
        <p>"Accursed Christians!" cried he, and he spat at us as we passed him.</p>
        <p>We were not unaccustomed to such treatment from some of the more fanatical Mussulmans, and gave no heed to the insult.</p>
        <p>"Are you armed?" I asked my friend, although we were not supposed to carry weapons. "There may be serious trouble."</p>
    <p>"I have a dirk," he answered.</p>
<p>"I am no better off than you," I said.</p>
        <p>As we crossed one of the branches of the Berada and drew within sight of St. Thomas' gateway, which those who speak Arabic call the Bab Tuma, there was not a soul in sight.</p>
        <p>"Strange!" cried Vitellis. "I never knew the gateway to be deserted before. Even the guard has disappeared."</p>
        <p>We broke into a brisk trot. Beneath our feet the thick dust rose in puffs like white powder. As we reached the decrepit outer archway we again heard the report of firearms and renewed shrieks.</p>
    <p>"Great God! It is a massacre!" my friend exclaimed.</p>
        <p>A massacre! I had not thought of that, though a month before dark threats had reached my ears. Not by nature inclined to look upon the gloomy side of things, I had allowed myself to believe that there was no danger of such a crisis, and now&#8212;</p>
        <p>As we sprang within the walls, out from the corner of an abutment where he had been concealed, leaped the sentry. Vitelis was a pace in advance, and did not see the murderous soldier, who stabbed him through the back with a bayonet before I could raise a hand in his defense. Forward on his face he fell and the wretch turned on me. The cowardly assault upon my friend filled me with a blind age, and I closed in with his assailant before he had an opportunity to use his weapon. To and fro we swayed, now slipping upon the uneven stones, now staggering against the wall. Suddenly my antagonist stumbled backward over a projecting point of pavement and down I came with my full weight upon him. He began to screech lustily for assistance, but I got my fingers upon his throat and choked his villainous life out as I would have choked a venomous reptile.</p>
        <p>I scrambled to my feet, I discovered his cries had attracted attention, for down one of the streets leading to the gateway I saw several men hurrying, and they were Moslems. They shouted madly when they observed me, and came onward with double energy. I cast one glance at the prone body of my friend, whom I knew to be beyond all human help <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>was the last <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>ever looked u<unclear reason="torn"></unclear>and fled <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> toward the heart of the Christian quarter.</p>
        <p>There was nothing to prevent me, had I had only my own safety in mind, from returning whither I had come, or seeking shelter in some one of the other numerous gardens within the walls. True, my own kin were in danger, for my uncle, with whom I had resided since my parents' death, had several weeks previous gone with his entire family to <choice><sic>Beyrout</sic><corr>Beirut</corr></choice>, where he had business interests, leaving me in charge of his Damascus <choice><sic>bazar</sic><corr>bazaar</corr></choice>. But there was one to whom it was quite possible that harm might come if, as seemed to be the case, a general massacre of the Christians had been precipitated&#8212;one in whom were bound up all my heart's hopes. Glauce Vlachos, who dwelt with her mother and brother hard by the class especially obnoxious to the Mohammedans, and hence it seemed likely that it was near to the home of my betrothed that the beginning of the outrage had occurred, a fact which filled me with the gravest apprehension the more I pondered upon it. I realized, now that blood had been shed, that the fanatical Moslems of the city, and the Druses who had recently come in from the Hauran and Lebanon, would pause at nothing. A crusade of murder and rapine throughout the whole Christian section was likely to ensue. I suspected that even <choice><sic>tht</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> soldiers would join in the pillage, and would not hesitate to avail themselves of an opportunity to plunder.</p>
        <p>Chaos had indeed come. No tie, no spot would be held sacred. My only hope was that the disturbance was as yet confined to the streets, an that the furious Moslems had not begun to attack the Christian houses.</p>
    <p>While these thoughts were chasing through my brain I strained every energy in eluding my pursuers. The street was tortuous, and I feared at each turn I might encounter others hostile to me, but I did not. I was now approaching a vicinity with which I was perfectly familiar, a quarter where I knew every dwelling, every lane and every blind alley. Suddenly I heard a disturbance directly ahead upon my left, whither the highway was leading me. Garbed as I was I knew that to advance was to run directly into the lion's jaw. On my right was a narrow lane which bent circuitously in the direction of the city walls. Into this I dashed. My pursuers were not in sight, and hope gave me renewed speed.</p>
        <p>A change of clothing, a disguise, that was what I must obtain. But how? Ah, there was Kuria Evander. Mme. Evander, as the French would say. Why had I not thought of her before? Her house communicated with the very lane which I was following> This good woman, who had thus providentially come into my mind, was a widow with whose husband my uncle had had extensive dealings in years past. It was to Evander, a Greek who had lapsed from orthodoxy to Islamism, that many Palmyrenes, Druses and Bedouins disposed of whatever they had for sale. He acted as a kind of middleman, and not only purchased but bartered, going on trading expeditions into the outlying regions far and near. Although he had been several years dead, I knew that his widows, an old acquaintance of my aunt, must still have n her possession some of the garments worn by her husband in his many comings and goings, for Evander was wont to dress after the manner of the people among whom he traded.</p>
        <p>At length I reached a doorway in the wall, communicating with a passage which, in turn, gave access to the house. I was aware that this entrance was quite as much in use as the more pretentious one, inasmuch as the laneway afforded a quicker means of gaining the large <choice><sic>bazars</sic><corr>bazaars</corr></choice> than the wider thoroughfare which the dwelling properly faced.</p>
    <p>I pulled a ringing summons upon the bell and waited in anxious suspense, listening for footsteps both without and within. Very soon I heard quick footfalls along the passage, and a voice which I recognized as Mme. Evander's called:</p>
<p>"Who is there?"</p>
<p>"'Tis I, Andreas Dorian," I answered. "There is a massacre of the Christians, and I am pursued."</p>
        <p>Instantly she began to undo the fastenings, and in a few seconds I was by her side.</p></div3>
        <div3>
<head type="sub">Part II.</head>
            <p>"I suspected from the sounds what was happening," she said, as I followed her to the inner court. "I am not surprised."</p>
            <p>Hurriedly I related to her my experience, and told her my wish. She knew of my betrothal to Glauce, and did not seriously attempt to dissuade me from again entering the streets.</p>
            <p>"I can disguise you," she said, "But would it not be well to wait until night <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>.</p>
    <p>"But think what may happen in the meanwhile!" I cried.</p>
<p>"As you will," she said, and then continued: "Should you succeed in reaching your friends, bring them hither, if possible, for they will be safer here if the pillage of houses begins. The Moslems will respect my husband's memory, and leave me unmolested."</p>
<p>I thanked her most earnestly, and then hastily proceeded to array myself in the coarse garb of a Druse trader which she brought me. Having arranged my head dress, I presented myself before her for inspection.</p>
            <p>"Good!" she exclaimed, "all save your color. That is too light and must be seen to."</p>
            <p>She hastened to fetch some kind of a dark pigment with which she smeared my face and hands, thoroughly rubbing it into the skin.</p>
            <p>"There!" she cried, standing off and surveying me. "I defy your best friend to recognize you."</p>
            <figure><ab>"I had not the courage to go further."</ab></figure>
    <p>"But it is not my friends that I would deceive."</p>
            <p>"Your dearest enemies, then. And now, since doubtless it has slipped your mind, so long is it since you have used your name, I will mind you that you are called Abdul-Hamir, and that you hail from Dekir in the Hauran."</p>
            <p>"Stay yet a moment!" she exclaimed, detaining me.</p>
            <p>Leaving me hurriedly, she presently returned with a pair of excellent pistols and a scimitar.</p>
    <p>"There," she said, "will complete your outfit," and then she pressed me to take some refreshments.</p>
            <p>I disposed of the weapons, but assured her that eating was quite out of the question, so she accompanied me to the laneway entrance where she again bade me bring my friends to the shelter of her roof. Then she cut short my expressions of gratitude by closing the door.</p>
            <p>Behind Lebanon, the sun was fast declining, red and round, and though there was no one in sight the uproar had increased during my brief tarry in the house of the good Mme. Evander. In half an hour, or three-quarters at the utmost, darkness would descend upon the city, and th<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> would add to the horrors of the gun and sword.</p>
    <p>There were two routes by which I could reach the home of my betrothed, and I hesitated in regard to which one I should pursue. Finally I decided to take the more circuitous, as in that direction there seemed to be less tumult. Accordingly I emerged from the lane into the street on which the other entrance to the Evander house opened. Striking out at a brisk pace, I passed several narrow cross thoroughfares, where I caught sight of hurrying forms. Presently I met a band of five murderous-looking wretches, one of whom accosted me.</p>
            <p>"Come with us," he said. "There is good game all about here."</p>
            <p>"Nay," I answered, "I may not, for I have an account of my own to settle."</p>
            <p>"May Allah speed you!" the villain exclaimed, and the five hastened in pursuit of a poor straggler whom they at that moment espied.</p>
    <p>After this test I felt assured of my disguise, and hurried onward with a bolder air. I knew that at any moment I might be forced to view, if not to participate in, some awful scene, and nerved myself for the trail. I had not long to wait, for soon, out from a cul-de-sac, where they had been at their fiendish work, a crowd of Druses and dervishes and the scum of the city rushed, and I was swept forward by it. I saw that it was quite useless to endeavor to extricate myself from the press, so suffered myself to be borne along without resistance.</p>
<p>"Death to the Christian dogs! Death to them in Allah's name!" was the rallying cry.</p>
            <p>Ere long, in the highway just ahead, three or four Christians were discovered defending themselves against half a dozen Moslems. When my companions saw this unequal combat a frenzied shout went up. There was a mad rush, in which I was compelled to join with the rest, and down upon the earth the poor unfortunates were dashed, to be hacked and hewn out of all human semblance. In the exultation which followed I was able to extricate myself from the assassin and to continue on my course.</p>
    <p>I was not nearing the quarter where the home of Glauce was situated, and, thinking to reach the house by a little <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> the Greek church. <unclear reason="torn">haps</unclear> half the rem<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> I became aware <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> approaching footsteps, though an account of a sharp angel just ahead I could not tell who the runners were. Where I chanced to be the walls were bare and smooth and high. There was not even a doorway in which I could stand and allow the oncomers to pass. I halted, set my back against the wall and waited in suspense. Nearer the footsteps drew and then the figure of a tall, muscular Greek, whom I remembered to have noticed in the sadlers' <choice><sic>bazar</sic><corr>bazaar</corr></choice>, appeared. He was armed with a stout cudgel, while close upon his heels, with drawn blades, pressed five Mussulmans.</p>
            <p>All saw me. The Greek, judging me from my apparel to be a foe, measured me with his eye as though calculating my strength, yet he did not pause. His pursuers set up a great shout, bidding me intercept him. This I realized, in order to carry out the part I was playing, I must make some show of doing. Accordingly I whipped out my scimitar. I had, however, no intention of making more than a pass at him, but he could not know this and smote at me with all his gathered strength and the fury of a desperate man. My weapon was of small avail in breaking the descent of the blow. Had I not realized my powerlessness and striven to avoid the sweeping billet my head must have been crushed to a jelly. As it was, even though I received but the glancing force of the stroke, I was hurled violently against the wall; I saw for an instant the eager face of the pursuing Moslems as through a bluish mist, then I felt my limbs falling and seemed to fall into a black void.</p>
    <p>The next sensation of which I was conscious was a sound like a great murmuring of wind, and I fancied myself for a moment lying beneath the boughs of the cedars of Lebanon where I Had once encamped. Then a sharp pain pierced my temples, and in spite of the agony I sat upright, for I recalled what had happened. Hours must have elapsed since my unfortunate encounter, for there hung the moon above me. As I thought of what might have occurred during the interval, I staggered to my feet. There was a great lump upon my head, but as I leaned against the wall I felt my strength gradually returning. After a little I began to <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> slowly at first then with <unclear reason="torn">erable</unclear> speed.</p>
            <p><unclear reason="torn"></unclear> reached the entrance to the Greek Church, and discovered that the doors had been battered in. The moonlight enabled me to see that the place had been sacked. motionless figures, some of them priests, lay stretched about on the floor. I shrank back in horror, and hastened with the direst apprehension on my way. Thus far I had encountered no living being. Should I find the same signs of death and desolation at my beloved's home? A few steps brought me to the house, and here my worst fears were realized. A breach had been made in the mud and mortar wall, and the odor of the outer passage was rent from its hinges. In the first court I came upon the body of the man servant, and at the opening of the inner court lay the maid. For a moment I had not the courage to go further. The fountain in the center of the inclosure was as musical as on the happiest night when I had listened to its murmur, side by side with my betrothed. Now the sound of it maddened me. All the living rooms of the family opened from this marble-paved space, and at length, with a resolution born of despair, I hurried from one apartment to another. Everywhere the direst confusion reigned. Divans were overturned, tapestries rent in shreds, ornaments shattered, the contents of chests and drawers strewn about and trampled upon.</p>
            <p>Search as I would, no trace could I find of her whom I sought, nor of her mother and brother. Then a kind of frenzy seized me, and, regardless of who might be attracted by the sound of my voice, I began calling my beloved by name.</p>
    <p>"Glauce! Glauce!" I cried, "For the love of God answer me! It is your Andreas who calls."</p>
            <p>Again and again I repeated her name, and the walls of the court flung it back to me. As I paused to listen after a series of desperate appeals. I fancied I heard a stir in the direction of a room into which I had cast but a hasty glance, a sort of store-room. While I was striding thither, a figure appeared in the moonlight which slanted in at the doorway. It was Glauce.</p></div3>
    <div3>
    <head type="sub">Part III.</head>
        <p>With a cry of joy I rushed forward to take her in my arms, but she sank upon her knees with a supplication for mercy, not recognizing me in my disguise. Raising her gently, I soon succeeded in assuring her that it was indeed I who had come to her rescue, whereat she clung to me with such loving trust that the pain in my head was suddenly gone, and I felt that I had been endowed with a giant's strength.</p>
        <p>Then I learned how, half an hour before the outbreak, her mother had gone upon an errand to her brother's <choice><sic>bazar</sic><corr>bazaar</corr></choice>; how Glauce had listened in horror to the attack upon the church; how, one by one, the houses in the vicinity had been assailed, and the inmates butchered; how, when she had heard the murderers at the entrance to her own home, she had insisted on secreting herself behind some boxes in a closet in the storeroom, though her maid besought her to hide elsewhere; how she had remained there for hours in awful suspense, and finally how she had ventured out at the sound of some on shouting her name, although she had not recognized the voice.</p>
    <p>"Oh, Andreas," she cried, when this recital was finished, "my mother! Can she have escaped?"</p>
        <p>"Yes, if she is with your brother, I have little doubt but what she is safe." I answered, for how could I tell her that the Christian <choice><sic>bazars</sic><corr>bazaars</corr></choice> would be attacked and looted and perhaps those dear to her pitilessly murdered?</p>
    <p>She brightened visibly under this assurance, and for the first time began to look about her. Then I cursed my carelessness in not removing the bodies of the two servants. As I stood wondering how I could for a few moments engage her attention she suddenly tightened her grip upon my arms.</p>
<p>"See!" she whispered. "There is some one in the outer court."</p>
        <p>We were exactly opposite the passage connecting the two courts, and I looked in the direction indicated just in time to detect a shadow slowly moving across the open space. An instant's hesitation might prove fatal to both of us, and I pushed Glauce gently within the storeroom.</p>
    <p>"Quick!" I said. "Conceal yourself again."</p>
        <p>Seeing that she was hastening to do as I bade, I slipped off my loose shoes, and with drawn scimitar in hand sped silently across the marble pavement to the passage by which the courts were joined. Along this I crept until I was within four or five feet of the further entrance, where hung a heavy piece of Bagdad drapery. Here I crouched and listened. The approaching footfalls told me that there was but one foe to be met, and I breathed a prayer of thanks-giving. Now the cautious steps were close at hand, and now I beheld, outlined clear against the moonlit background, the cruel and cunning face of a Druse. As he unsuspectingly advanced I swung my scimitar and clove his head to the chin. Down he sand in a limp heap, and I surveyed my bloody work without a shudder, such as the avenging fury that possessed me. Hastily dragging the body of the Druse to a shadowy corner, and having gently laid the maid and manservant side by side in one of the outer rooms, I summoned Glauce from her concealment.</p>
        <p>"We are safe for the present," I said, to reassure her. She seemed to understand, and did not question me. Then I told her of Mme. Evander's offer.</p>
    <p>"Oh, let us go to her at once," my betrothed cried.</p>
<p>"But you cannot venture into the streets dressed as you are," I exclaimed. "Even in my present array I could not protect you for a moment."</p>
<p>She glanced ruefully down at her soiled and tumbled gown.</p>
        <p>"I suppose a suit of Constantine (Constantine as her brother) would not do? she said, with a charming look, forgetting for the instant the gravity of the situation.</p>
        <p>"No," I replied, "but one belonging to Petros, you, <note>last column of story is folded under</note></p>
        <p>"Part of them suspect us! We must make a dash for the Consulate. Now, before they move!" I cried, grasping Glauce's hand.</p>
        <p>We sprang forward together, and for a few seconds they did not hear us, nor could they see us, for we kept within the shadow. Then the sound of our flying footsteps reached their ears, and a wild shout of rage went up.</p>
    <p>"We are safe, Glauce, safe," I exclaimed, "if they are awake at the Consulate!"</p>
        <p>I knew our pursuers were gaining rapidly, but our shelter was close at hand. We reached the door, and I struck upon it repeated blows with the hilt of my scimitar. There was an answering shout from within. We heard a chain fall, and the shooting back of bolts. Then the great iron-clenched barrier swung upon its hinges, and there stood the porter with his lantern. We leaped past him with a cry of joy, and the massive door clanged shut in the faces of the howling Druses.</p>

<head type="sub">Few More Ideas Offered by the Many Readers of the World-Herald.</head>
<head type="sub">Flying Machine Made Practical and Amusing, Which Will Eclipse the Ferris Wheel.</head>
<head type="sub">A Mushroom Exhibit and Its Beneficial Results&#8212;Live Indians to Illustrate American History&#8212;Other Suggestions.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The World-Herald publishes this week another series of ideas for the Trans-Mississippi exposition to be held in Omaha during the summer of 1898.</p>
<p>W. W. Jenne, Falls City, Neb.&#8212;If the management could get an air ship or flying machine that could be operated safely it not only would be the greatest attraction, but it would be more thoroughly advertised and would more thoroughly advertise the exposition, and create a greater sensation than any once other attraction that could be produced, and I would submit the following plan for the management to think over. Get one of the parties that claim to have perfected their flying machines to build one that will carry five or six people, or more, and so constructed that a large balloon could be placed over and attached to it. This balloon would enable them to ascend as high as they wished to go. Then they could open the valve in the balloon and let out the gas or hot air (which ever they use), gradually, starting the engine in the airship and circle around and descend. I think there ought to be a space of about 200 feet in diameter, with railroads from circumference, all verging to the center. The ship could light any place on the 200 feet in diameter and be easily moved to the center, when the balloon could be refilled. There could be an excavation underneath the center sufficiently large for all the apparatus and all attachments sufficient to re-charge the balloon. I think the plan is feasible and could be accomplished. It would be one of the greatest attractions at the exposition.</p></div3>
<div3><head type="sub">CHAPTERS IN AMERICAN HISTORY</head>
<p>James M. Gillan&#8212;If the facilities which are to be provided include a large auditorium, suitable for an immense ground floor theater, I think a very attractive feature of the Trans-Mississippi exposition could be provided for in the form of historical plays, in which the genuine Indian would become the central figure and chief performer.</p>
<p>Let me simply suggest an outline of what I have in view, and the reader may fill in the details. I understand that, in all probability, there will be a real North American Indian exhibit in connection with the exposition, such as probably the world has never seen before. The location of Omaha and the name Omaha, by the way, suggests an effort in this direction that can easily be made to over-reach all former exhibits of Indian life and of the advancement of the red man along the lines of civilization. Taking it for granted that there will be a large number of Indians present for the purpose of making the Indian exhibit real and true to life, I have imagined that a series of historic plays might be introduced as night attractions that would be both interesting and instructive.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, the story of John Smith. With a little clever work the skeleton of a play could be constructed, and with a few intelligent Indians and some white men to take the parts, it appears to me a very interesting entertainment could be made out of that familiar old story. There would be ample opportunity in such a piece to work in a thousand and one little things characteristic of Indian life.</p>
<p>In the story of William Penn may be found the frame work for another evening of rare entertainment along the same line.</p></div3>
<div3><head type="sub">THE CUSTER MASSACRE, ILLUSTRATED.</head>
<p>A thrilling and realistic entertainment might be made out of a representation of the famous Custer massacre, and when one looks over the field it will be seen that the history of our country is thickly studded with events that might be portrayed in great living pictures of immense proportions and in a manner more real and thrilling than ever before. This is a field, I think, that will be very rich in possibilities if some man with the right brand of genius could and would enter upon the work of developing it. I would not advise a sort of pocket edition of Buffalo Bill's "Wild West" show, but something more gentle and historic, and not so rough and explosive in character. I hope this suggestion may be taken up by some one who can give it thought and attention.</p></div3>
<div3><head type="sub">A MUSHROOM STUDY.</head>
<p>Harriet S. MacMurphy&#8212;The department of household economics of the Woman's club has organized for the study of mycology. What has that to do with a plan for the exposition?</p>
<p>First, let me explain what mycology means, as there may be those who do not understand the term mycology, although they know the work which it signifies. Mycology is that branch of natural science which relates to fungi or mushrooms.</p>
<p>During the World's fair a Polish countess came to Chicago and almost at the feet of the exposition she picked up twenty-five varieties of mushrooms growing wild, which were allowed to fall uneaten beneath the feet of the multitude, when they contained as much nourishment as the richest porterhouse steak. She taught a few Americans how to distinguish them and to cook them.</p>
<p>The prairies of the western states are full of edible mushrooms, and the women of the west propose to know as much about the food products of the country as Polish countesses. Therefore, they will study these very nutritious food products, which have hitherto gone to waste. They will then suggest that in the food department of the Trans-Mississippi exposition the best display of western mushrooms that it is possible to obtain be made, that display to be daily renewed, and practical methods of preparing them be given, to the end that one of the most healthful and nutritious foods provided by nature shall be utilized.</p>
<p>We are said to be the most wasteful nation on the earth. We sent to France for the mushrooms that are growing at our very doors, and that a little cultivation would bring forth in almost endless quantities.</p>
<p>The most cultivated tastes are the ones that enjoy the mushroom. The wild fungus of the prairie far excels the cultivated product that comes from foreign lands.</p>
<p>A display of these various and curious growths, from the giant puff ball to the tiny cup that might shelter a fairy, <note>column ends abruptly</note></p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="main">RESPONSIBILITY AND RESPO<unclear reason="torn"></unclear></head>
<p>During the present week the lower house of the Nebraska legislature consider the Trans-Mississippi exposition bill. The World-Herald ta<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> opportunity for a serious talk with the members of the legislature. I<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> not to be necessary to impress upon a body of intelligent men the grave importance of a liberal appropriation by the state within whose borders the exposition is to be held. But it cannot be denied that there is an ele<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> opposition to any appropriation by the state of Nebraska for this exposition. That this opposition is limited to a few persons is well demonstrated <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> interviews printed in the World-Herald during the past week, and the overwhelming sentiment among the taxpayers of the state is in favor of <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>appropriations.</p>
    <p>So far as the bill is concerned, this is not a political question. <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>involved the best interests of all Nebraska and the dignity of this s<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> home and abroad. The most difficult thing of accomplishment is a <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> appropriation, but already the congress has pledged $200,000 to this exposition and the members of congress have become so impressed with the importance of the enterprise that it is very likely that this appropriation will <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>creased to $275,000. Nebraska has been the recipient of very gene<unclear reason="torn"></unclear>gratulations upon the fact that so liberal an appropriation has been by the federal government to an enterprise that is to be located w<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> borders of Nebraska.</p>
    <p>If after the federal government has shown its appreciation of the importance of this exposition the Nebraska legislature should fail to <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> appropriation, or making an appropriation, should limit it to a compa<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> insignificant sum, what would be thought of Nebraska? Would not <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>dition of this state be humiliating to every good citizen? Would not N<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> be the subject for the jests and jibes of those who are only too willing <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> reflections upon western states?</p>
    <p>The preliminary work on this great enterprise has been brought <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> point where all that is necessary to insure its success is a liberal appropriation by the state which more than any other one state will be benefited <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> this enterprise. And it must not be forgotten that all that is necessary <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>sure the utter collapse of the enterprise is for the Nebraska legislature either fail to make any appropriation or to make an appropriation <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> a sum that would practically be of no benefit.</p>
    <p>Turning from this point of view, which demonstrates the necessit<unclear reason="torn"></unclear>tion on the part of Nebraska, the legislature has but to consider the <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>tions: "Do the people of this state favor a liberal appropriation, a<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> Nebraska afford to make the outlay for the returns that are assure<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> state?"</p>
    <p>Concerning the first proposition there ought to be no doubt. The <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> Herald undertakes to say, after careful investigation, that there i<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> county in Nebraska whose taxpayers, by an overwhelming majority <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> favor a liberal appropriation. Concerning the second proposition, it <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> necessary to present evidence in the affirmative. The appropriation <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> would not increase the taxes of any citizen of the state, while the p<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> of this sum would be less than 30 cents for every individual in the state <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> returns by way of increased value in Nebraska real estate and the <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>ment of all Nebraska interests, together with the splendid adver<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> afforded this state, are so evident that it is hardly necessary to mention.</p>
    <p>The World-Herald believes it to be the duty of every member of the <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>ture, regardless of politics, to go to the support of the exposition bill <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>fore the lower house. That measure ought not to become the instru<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> which political grievances are avenged. Republicans and bimetallists to unite upon this measure and show to the world that Nebraska is a <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>sive state.</p>
    <p>While it is the duty of men of all parties to support this measure <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> not be forgotten that the dominant party in all legislative bodies <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> carries the burden of all legislation or the failure of legislation.</p>
    <p>Some of the members who have opposed this bill seem to have <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> all their attention to one side of their responsibility. These have dwelt <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> upon the idea that if they make no appropriation or make an insignificant appropriation they will escape all serious responsibility. They seem n<unclear reason="torn"></unclear>alize that in refusing to make an adequate appropriation they assume responsibility of striking a death blow at the exposition. That is <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>sibility which no political party in existence could safely assume.</p>
    <p>Speaking directly to the dominant forces in the legislature the W<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> aid will be pardoned if it reminds those forces that no individual or <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> in Nebraska has a deeper interest or a greater anxiety for wise legisla<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> creditable discharge of all duties by the bimetallists in this legisla<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> the World-Herald itself. We do not believe it is necessary for the W<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> aid to assure the bimetallists in the legislature that the World-Herald not urge this exposition appropriation at the hands of a bimetallist. <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> if the World-Herald did not believe that such a course would reflect <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> the dominant political forces in Nebraska.</p>
    <p>The men who imagine that public sentiment in this state is <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>whelmingly in favor of a liberal appropriation have studied public <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> to no purpose. The taxpayers of this state are favorable to this me<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> the legislature ought to pass it by a practically unanimous vote.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">WHAT THE WOMEN WILL DO</head>
<head type="sub">Plan of Organization for the Woman's Board of Managers.</head>
<head type="sub">EDUCATIONAL EXHIBIT IN THEIR HANDS</head>
<head type="sub">Board Will All Have Charge of a Series of Congresses on Various Scientific and Philanthropical Lines&#8212;Call for Mass Meeting.</head>
    <div3>
<p>One of the several very important matters in connection with the Transmississippi and International Exposition yet to be settled is the election of members of the Woman's board, which will be disposed of the latter part of next week. The plan of organization for this board was approved by the executive committee of the exposition at the meeting yesterday afternoon, and all that now remains to be done is to elect the members of the board.</p>
<p>It was not deemed advisable to have a distinct woman's building in connection with the exposition, and the Woman's board has been given charge of the educational exhibit, which is made a bureau of the Department of exhibits. The board will also have the direction of such congresses on scientific and philosophical subjects as may be gathered together during the life of the exposition.</p>
<p>The board will be composed of twenty-seven members, distributed as heretofore published in The Bee, and will be empowered to elect its own officers, and adopt rules for its own government, its actions, however, to be at all times subject to the approval of the exposition executive committee.</p>
<p>The plan of organization in detail as adopted by the women and approved by the executive committee, giving the full scope of the work to be undertaken, is as follows:</p>
<p>Section 1: That the women be given charge of the subdepartment of education in its various branches, viz: The exhibits of the work of public schools, kindergartens, manual training and industrial schools, schools for the deaf, blind, and feeble minded, art schools, reform schools, and all schools of special instruction; and that they also have charge of a series of congresses on various scientific and philosophical lines during the months from June to November, 1898.</p>
<p>Section 2. That this subdepartment of education be in the hands and under control of a board of managers of twenty-seven in number, as more particularly specified in section 11, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of the exposition; eleven of said managers shall be chosen from Omaha, two from South Omaha, two from Council Bluffs and twelve from Nebraska outside of Omaha and South Omaha.</p>
<p>Section 3. That the local members of the Board of Managers be elected at a mass meeting of the women of Omaha; that the members from South Omaha and Council Bluffs shall be elected at a mass meeting of the women in each of said cities called for that purpose, each of said meetings to be called by the secretary of this board; the Omaha meeting to be held Friday, February 11, 1896 at 2 o'clock p.m.</p>
<p>Section 4. That from each congressional district in the state, two members of the Board of Managers shall be elected at a mass meeting of the women of each district called for that purpose.</p>
<p>Section 5. That the congressman from each congressional district shall designate where the said mass meetings shall be held, and, if desired by the women of said district, the Board of Directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition will send a woman from Omaha to said district to fully explain the ends and aims of the expositions.</p>
<p>Section 6. That the said Board of Managers may elect its own officers and adopt rules governing its actions.</p>
<p>Section 7. That two women from each state outside of Nebraska be selected to form an advisory council, auxiliary to the Board of Managers.</p>
<p>Section 8. That the advisory council be selected by the Board of Managers from names suggested to the board by the different state federations of clubs and other educational organization</p>
<p>Section 9. That the members of the Board of Managers and of the advisory council do not receive renumeration.</p>
<p>Section 10. That in the work of the various departments and committees of the Transmississippi and International Exposition where the services of women would be valuable, that they be asked to render such services.</p>
<p>Section 11. The powers of the said Board of Managers shall be complete for the purposes above outlined, subject, however, to the approval of the executive committee of the Transmississippi and International Exposition, and to provide for this approval the secretary of the said Board of Managers shall transmit a report of the proceedings of their meetings to the secretary of the exposition, who shall thereupon lay same before the executive committee for its approval.</p>
<p>In pursuance of the power conferred upon him by the foregoing articles, Secretary Wakefield has issued the following call for a mass meeting of women to be held in this city next Friday afternoon:</p>
<p>In accordance with the provisions of the plan of organization for the Bureau of Education of the Transmississippi and International Exposition, a mass meeting of the women of Omaha is hereby called to meet on Friday, February 12, at 3 o'clock p.m. in the Creighton theater. Fifteenth and <note>column ends abruptly</note></p></div3>
<div3>
    <head type="sub">NORTH SIDERS EXPRESS APPROVAL.</head>
<p>The reading of the report consumed some time and it was listened to with the closest attention. When the secretary finished reading the lobby enjoyed itself and nearly raised the roof. It is unnecessary to remark that the exuberance did not emanate from the supporters of the sites other than Miller park.</p>
<p>Mr. Bidwell gained the floor as soon as order was restored and moved that the report be adopted and that the board proceed at once to vote on the selection of a site.</p>
<p>Mr. Montgomery objected to any such procedure and wanted the report placed on file and the vote on a site postponed until the directors had time to examine the report.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosewater suggested that the report should be published in full and thoroughly discussed by the board before taking a vote.</p>
<p>Mr. Montgomery's amendment to place the report on file was adopted and then Mr. Farrell moved that the consideration of the report and a vote on the site be postponed for one week.</p>
<p>This was hotly opposed by the Miller park people and it was urged that the city council had deferred making the annual tax levy until it was determined whether the exposition was to be held in one of the public parks or on private ground. In this connection Mr. Wharton called on President Wattles to state the result of his interview with the members of the city council on this point.</p>
<p>Mr. Wattles stated that some of the councilmen had told him that the council would not make an extra levy for the park fund until it was decided whether the exposition was to be located in one of the parks.</p>
<p>Mr. Wharton moved an amendment that the consideration of the report and a vote on a site be deferred until Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Mr. Lindsey opposed this, saying that the matter should be given ample time to afford full discussion and avoid any charge that the board had taken snap judgment in the matter.</p></div3>
<div3>
    <head type="sub">MR. HITCHCOCK'S ATTITUDE.</head>
<p>Mr. Hitchcock said Thursday would be ample time, but called attention to what he regarded as important details. He said that the supporters of all sites would be required to appear before the board next Tuesday and present good evidence that there were no defects in the title to the ground offered for sites which would interfere in any way with the exposition or cause any expense to the association, and to also make a showing as to the approaches to the grounds in order that there might be no misunderstanding when it came to getting into the grounds by rail or otherwise. Mr. Hitchcock said that if the site should be selected before these points were settled it might be the means of causing great expense to the exposition association.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosewater said he did not want to discuss the report of the engineers but he called attention to the fact that the recommendation of Miller park was based on the supposition that the old fort ground was at the disposal of the people of Omaha. Mr. Rosewater said this ground could easily be secured by special act of congress and he explained briefly the situation with respect to the disposition of this ground.</p>
<p>Mr. Wharton urged prompt action and said that postponement until Tuesday would give everybody plenty of time to investigate the various sites if they had not already done so.</p>
<p>Mr. Montgomery made a strong statement of the legal points which must be guarded against in making the selection of a site, in order that no complication surrounding the title might imperil the success of the exposition.</p>
<p>Mr. Webster said the question of a site should be decided as soon as possible in order to prevent strife between the different sections of the city. He made a lengthy speech along this line and concluded by offering a substitute that the board proceed at once to select a site, each member expressing his preference upon roll call.</p></div3>
    <div3>    
    <head type="sub">COULDN'T CONTROL THEIR JOY.</head>
        <p>While this discussion was going as the adherents of Miller park is the lobby applauded every speaker who urged prompt action and were very boisterous in their behavior. This caused Mr. Montgomery to enter an indignant protest. He said it was very evident that there were a number of Miller park people on the board and in the lobby, but he said he did not intend to be bulldozed and her served notice that if the site question as forced to a vote at once he would refuse to vote, not because he was opposed to Miller park or in favor of any other site, but simply because he had not had time to consider the recommendations and findings of the engineers.</p>
        <p>"Why don't you say you will refuse to pay your subscription if it is located in Miller park?" shouted A. T. Rector, the director elected to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of J. A. Wakefield.</p>
        <p>When order was restored again Mr. Rosewater secured the floor. He prefaced his remarks by saying that no one could accuse him of obstructing the exposition in any way, but he expressed the opinion that the whole course of developments had been foreordained. He charged that the report of the engineers sounded suspiciously like another engineer's report which had been read <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> the city hall not very long ago. Mr. Rosewater said that while he was in Chicago recently he had taken occasion to inquire about the engineers employed by the special committee of the board. He told about the difficulties he had encountered in getting any trace of the gentlemen. He said he had inquired of the city engineer and was met with the statement that the gentlemen were unknown to that official. He had then tried prominent engineers who had been long in the city, but with no better success. He found that they were not members of the American Society of Civil Engineers, or of any other prominent society of engineers, but after extended inquiry he said he had found that Mr. Alexander was the superintendent of Lincoln park, on the North Side and Mr. Shrader was connected with the park board on the West side of Chicago. Mr. Rosewater said he had learned that the two men were placed in their positions by the reigning political party, and were about to be ousted from their positions by the succeeding party, that they were not engineers of prominence or of standing n the profession. Continuing, Mr. Rosewater attacked the report of the engineers, which he said was weak in several points.</p></div3>
    <div3>    
    <head type="sub">SPECIAL ACT OF CONGRESS NEEDED.</head>
        <p>General Manderson followed Mr. Rosewater and explained still further the conditions and complications surrounding the use of the old fort grounds, saying that the land is directly in charge of the secretary of war,w ho is charged with the duty of dividing it and selling it to the highest bidder, and has no power to lease it or permit any portion of it to be used. The speaker expressed the opinion, however, that congress might easily be prevailed upon to pass such legislation at the coming special session as would allow the ground to be used temporarily for exposition purposes. General Manderson then made some very sarcastic references tot he faces of the directors being blank pages, whereon the name of the very best site for the exposition was yet to be written, and said that the members of the board were eminently qualified to sit as judges, as he doubted not that none of them had been improperly approached. Continuing, the speaker said that he was not prepared to vote on the selection of a site, as he had not heard the report of the engineers, and he asked that the talking of a vote be deferred until a full session of the board was secured, at which the merits of the several sites should be presented and a vote then taken. He suggested that the advocates of each site be required to present the advantages and conditions surrounding their site, and that fifteen minutes be given to each site at a meeting to be held Tuesday afternoon.</p></div3>
    <div3>    
    <head type="sub">FINAL ACTION POSTPONED.</head>
        <p>This idea met with favor, and after a great deal of discussion the following resolution was adopted.</p>
        <p>Resolved, That when this board adjourns it be until Tuesday, at 2 p. m., to act upon the selection of an exposition site, and that the supporters of all sites be required to present at that time&#8212;</p>
    <p>First&#8212;Proof of the character of the legal title and of power of possession;</p>
        <p>Second&#8212;Proof and specification of the sufficiency of approaches, including both public highways and railroad trackage and maps of the ground offered;</p>
        <p>Third&#8212;A bond of $10,000, conditioned to furnish possession and approaches without expense to the exposition, and that free and unobstructed use of the site shall be given to the exposition without expense to the exposition; that the site so selected by the directors shall be at their disposal whenever the directors ask for it, and continue during the exposition and thereafter until the exposition directors shall have removed all exhibits, structures, etc., and not later than April 1, 1899.</p>
    <p>Resolved, That the promoters of each site shall be given fifteen minutes at the meeting on Tuesday in which to present the merits of their proposed site.</p>
<p>After the adoption of this resolution the meeting adjourned to meet Tuesday of this week at the Commercial club rooms at 2 p. m.</p></div3></div2>
    
    <div2 type="article"><head type="sub">TO BE THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION.</head>
        <head type="sub">Executive Committee Discusses the Woman's Department.</head>
        <p>The woman's department of the exposition constituted the principal topic for discussion at the regular meeting of the executive committee at noon yesterday. It was decided that the department to be given over to the charge of the women should be designated as the Bureau of Education of the Department of Exhibits.</p>
        <p>The mass meeting of the woman of Omaha to be held at Creighton theater Friday afternoon of this week at 2 o'clock will be called to order by President Wattles if he is in the city and in the event of his absence of Vice President Alvin Saunders will preside.</p>
        <p>The executive committee decided to recommend to the mass meeting of women that the eleven members of the Board of Managers be elected in the following manner: That an informal ballot be first taken, each woman to vote for eleven names. The twenty-two women receiving the highest vote shall be considered as the candidates and a formal ballot then taken, each woman voting for eleven of these twenty-two women, the eleven receiving the highest vote to be declared elected.</p>
        <p>On recommendation of the Department of Promotion it was decided to send excursions to the legislatures of the various transmississippi states to appear before those bodies and explain the merits of the exposition and endeavor to secure the passage of the bills making appropriations for state exhibits. Manager Hitchcock presented a number of invitations from the various states, asking that delegations be sent to present the merits of the exposition. A committee was appointed, comprising Manager Babcock of the Department of Transportation, President Wattles and Chairman Lindsey of the executive committee, to make the necessary arrangements.</p>

<div2 type="article">
    <head type="sub">THE ENGINEERS' REPORT.</head>
<p>It is always the unexpected that happens, runs the old adage. It was not so, however, with the sealed verdict which the imported expert engineers rendered in the case of the competing exposition sites. Although the resolution adopted by the full board of the exposition directors was voted with the general understanding that no recommendation was to be made of any particular site, and that the engineers were to be employed to make an unbiased professional report of the advantages and disadvantages of each of the sites from the standpoint of engineering and landscape architecture, the two Chicago experts have gone out of their ways to relieve the directors of their duty to fix upon the location and to direct them what to do.</p>
<p>Instead of presenting a carefully prepared review of the engineering problems to be solved, the relative cost of making each of the sites available for exposition purposes, including grading, sewerage, water supply, fire protection, paving, drainage, building artificial lakes, the experts simply regale the public with a job lot of platitudes as to distances, transportation facilities and topographical descriptions, with great stress in every other sentence on the importance of irrigation. Judging from the tenor of the report, the chief object of the exposition is the establishment of a model irrigation farm. From first to last the report is so constructed as to create the impression that not less than four hundred acres are required for the exposition and that the approaches from the city by rail or roadway must be on a dead level.</p>
<p>With such conditions imposed upon the exposition managers, Miller park would be the only available site. If that were really the case there was no necessity for squandering money on experts or going through the meaningless form of a competition for location. The fact is that neither 400 acres nor half that number are required for an exposition site, even if irrigation were to be the greatest feature.</p>
<p>The false assumption of the engineers that Fort Omaha is a part of the Miller Park site is as misleading as their assertion that location is preferable to others because it affords a splendid opportunity for the erection of permanent buildings. Fort Omaha cannot be utilized for the exposition without a special act of congress, and no permanent building designed with a view to its conversion into a museum or auditorium would be of service located four miles from the postoffice. Even Chicago, with its vast population and improved rapid transit system, has found that the field museum has lost its value as a public institution by reason of its distance from the business center, and a proposition to remove it to the lake front is earnestly advocated.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of The Bee to attempt an analysis of the expert report, as there is scarcely anything to analyze. It reads like the plea of a retained lawyer, instead of an uncolored statement of facts and figures by an engineer. It goes without saying that it will be so regarded by all persons familiar with the subject. As a guide to the directors the report can carry no weight. It scarcely affords a plausible excuse for those predetermined to follow its advice.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">for the Women's Board.</head>
<p>Since Secretary Wakefield of the Transmississippi Exposition has issued a call for a mass meeting of women to be held next Saturday afternoon at the parlors of the Young Men's Christian association, interest in the matter has been revived to some extent. South Omaha will be entitled to two members on the board of women managers, and already there is one candidate in the field for that honor. Mrs. N. B. Mead, Twenty-second and N streets, is being urged <choice><sic>bzy</sic><corr>by</corr></choice> her friends to enter the race, and very likely she will do so. Mrs. Mead is quite prominent in church work and is very well and favorably known here, her husband being manager of the Western Union Telegraph company's office at the exchange. Besides belonging to several church societies, Mrs. Mead is one of the prominent members of the Eastern Star. Her friends are of opinion that she would be a creditable representative of the city on the board of women managers.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Mass Meeting to Elect Board of Lady Managers.</head>
<p>Secretary Wakefield of the exposition association announces that the mass meeting of the women of Omaha to elect eleven members of the Board of Lady Managers of the exposition, which is called to meet in Creighton theater Friday afternoon of this week, will be called to order at 2:30, instead of 2 o'clock, as at first announced. This change was made in order that the school teachers of the city, who have manifested a lively interest in the exposition, may have an opportunity to take part in the business of the meeting. Superintendent Pearse called the attention of the secretary to the fact that if the meeting was called to order at 2 o'clock, as announced, the teachers would not be able to be present, and he requested that the hour be changed to 3 o'clock. After consulting with the officers of the exposition association it was decided to change the hour to 2:30.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">Board of Lady Managers.</head>
<p>The following named women have consented to allow their names to be balloted upon in the selection of members of the Lady Board of Managers of the Transmississippi Exposition: Mesdames J. H. McIntosh, Thomas L. Kimball, N. P. Feil, W. W. Keysor, Grace B. Sudborough and W. P. Halford.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">LOCATING THE EXPOSITION</head>
<head type="sub">MEETING OF DIRECTORS THIS AFTERNOON</head>
<head type="sub">Resolution Requiring a Majority of the Directors in Favor of One Site to Decide is Defeated.</head>
<p>The meeting of the directors of the Exposition association to decide upon a site for the exposition was held this afternoon in the Board of Trade building. The meeting was held in the large room on the second floor that the lobby might be accommodated, and the lobby was out in full force. It was a very miscellaneous gathering, composed largely of residents of the northern part of the city, with a large sprinkling of representatives of organized labor, and advocates of the several proposed sites, with those representing Miller park greatly in the majority.</p>
<p>Roll call at 2 o'clock showed less than a quorum present, and it was fifteen minutes after the hour when a bare quorum of twenty-six <choice><sic>mebers</sic><corr>members</corr></choice> was counted.</p>
<p>President Wattles called the meeting to order and cautioned the lobby against indulging in applause or making any noise during the meeting.</p>
<p>During the reading of the minutes other members came in until there were thirty present, when Mr. Lindsey presented a resolution providing that when a vote is taken on the question of a site a majority of the board shall be required in favor of a site before it can be selected, and providing, also, that the vote be taken by written ballots.</p>
<p>Mr. Wharton objected to the resolution for the reason that a number of the directors were out of the city and others had remained until today in order to vote on the question, and it would be unfair to them to wait until a full attendance is required.</p>
<p>In reply to a request by Mr. Payne, the secretary read the resolution offered by Mr. Wharton at the meeting of January 11, which provided that the full board shall vote on the question of a site.</p>
<p>President Wattles ruled that the latter resolution had no bearing on the matter in hand and referred simply to the Board of Directors as distinguished from the ex-<note>column ends abruptly</note></p>
<p>Mr. Webster and Mr. Millard opposed any further delay and urged immediate action.</p>
<p>Mr. Lindsay urged that the choice for site should not be left to a bare majority of the board, thus throwing the choice of a site into the hands of fourteen or fifteen men.</p>
<p>President Wattles took the floor to oppose the resolution, saying that all members of the board had ample notice of the meeting and if they were not present it was not the fault of those who had come to the meeting. He advised the rejection of the resolution.</p>
<p>General Manderson opposed the position taken by the president, and predicted that if the question of a site was not decided by the vote of a majority of the entire board for one site there would be great dissatisfaction and the exposition would suffer. He opposed allowing a majority of thirty-three men to decide the location.</p>
<p>Ex-Governor Saunders charged that the resolution was simply brought in for the purpose of delay and he opposed it.</p>
<p>There was applause and yells from the lobby at the conclusion of Saunder's remarks, and President Wattles cautioned the spectators that the room would be cleared unless they refrained from making so much noise.</p>
<p>A vote was taken upon the resolution and a roll call was taken, resulting as follows: Ayes, 16; nays, 20. It was declared lost.</p>
<p>The president announced that the special order of the meeting would be taken up and he said the supporters of each site would be given ten minutes in which to present the points in favor of their site.</p>
<p>On motion of General Manderson the sites were called in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>East Omaha was called, but no one appeared to defend the claims of that location.</p>
<p>Elmwood park was called next and W. R. Bennett read a paper, setting forth at length the advantages presented by the site which includes Elmwood park and the State fair grounds.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">WILL PROTEST AGAINST THE BILL.</head>
<head type="sub">Central Labor Union Decides to Send a Committee to Lincoln.</head>
<p>At a special meeting last night the Central Labor union decided to draw up a protest against the Transmississippi Exposition appropriation bill as it has been introduced in the legislature. A committee of three, consisting of Grabach, Clark and Bell, was appointed to draw up this protest and have it printed. Copies to the number of 250 were ordered printed and those are to be taken to Lincoln by two members of the committee for distribution.</p>
<p>This committee is further empowered to see that the friends of labor in the legislature work for the amendments which the central labor union desired to be incorporated in the appropriation bill. These amendments provided that labor on the exposition shall be employed but eight hours a day at a minimum scale of $1.50 a day. The fact that these amendments were not found in the bill introduced called forth the special meeting.</p>
<p>It was also determined that this committee should attend the meeting of the board of exposition directors today to invite a committee from that body to a conference in the labor matter. If this conference should be held the labor union would endeavor to persuade the board committee to recommend the adoption of the union's desired amendments by resolution. It is not expected, however, that the invitation will be accepted.</p>
<p>In case of a refusal to confer, the union committee will then go to Lincoln to lobby against the bill as now prepared. The members will try to have it so arranged that the appropriation shall never reach the hands of the board of exposition directors, but shall be expended by a state board of managers. At least one-half of this board shall consist of laboring men.</p>
<p>This plan of campaign was decided upon after a discussion that lasted over three hours. It was practically the only matter considered, although a motion was made that the action of the union in recommending the selection of the poor farm site for the exposition be rescinded. The motion was not allowed to come up on the grounds that the meeting, being special, could not consider it.</p></div2>

        <head type="sub">BY THE TRANSMISSISSIPPI PRESS.</head>
        <p>Eureka (Utah) Miner: The Transmississippi Exposition which will be held in Omaha from June to November, 1898, will be a western institution for the benefit of western industries and every western state should lend its influence and assistance in making the exposition a success. there is no doubt but that this Transmississippi Exposition will be of almost incalculable benefit to the entire west on account of the advertisement of our resources and advantages which it will furnish. We believe that every western state will take advantage of it to push its own interests to the fore and we trust Utah will not be a laggard. The exhibit from Utah ought to be one of the most extensive at the exposition, for no state in the west has the advantages for investment and settlement which we have. We trust that the legislature will see to it that this matter is not overlooked in the list of appropriations.</p>
    <p>Ellensburg (Wash.) Capital: Active preparations are being made in Omaha for the Transmississippi and International Exposition, which is to be held there in 1898. The idea is one that appeals especially to the people of the great west, and no doubt their best energies will be thrown into it.</p>
        <p>Ft. Smith (Ark.) News Record: The News-Record has, from time to time, referred to the Transmississippi Exposition which is to be held in Omaha in 1898.</p>
        <p>The indications now are that this exposition, which is to show the resources of the region west of the Mississippi river, will be a great success. Already a hearty response is being sent from every section of the country invited to participate, and there is every reason to believe that the affairs will be in all respects worthy of the closing years of a remarkable century. From the golden wheat fields of the north to the cotton fields of the south the territory to be embraced in the exhibits is one of incomparable richness in every element of natural wealth. Drawing from such a region, an exposition of the character projected cannot but be of tremendous importance.</p>
    <p>The people of Omaha, with their characteristic push and enterprise, have risen to the occasion and subscribed something over $300,000 to the enterprise&#8212;a feat of no small magnitude in times such as these. A bill is now pending in the Nebraska legislature providing for the appropriation of $350,000 more, and we have no doubt that if necessities demand it the people of Omaha and Nebraska will do still more.</p>
        <p>With the memories of the splendid results flowing from our exhibit at the World's fair to spur them on the Arkansas legislators should not fail to provide an appropriation of sufficient magnitude to give Arkansas an exhibit at the Omaha exposition worthy of the imperial resources of this commonwealth.</p>
        <p>What states in the union can show to the world timber, fruit, cotton, wheat, lead coal, gold, silver, zinc, copper, iron, manganese, marble, granite, novaculite, petroleum and a score of other equally important products?</p>
    <p>Arkansas&#8212;Arkansas alone. And it is only her just due that all the world should know of these things.</p>
     <p>West Union (Ia.) Gazette: The Transmississippi and International Exposition will be held in Omaha in 1898. The work is in good hands, and cannot be otherwise than a success. It will undoubtedly prove a big thing for Omaha and the entire middle west.</p>
        <p>Little Rock (Ark.) Gazette: In the bill appropriating a certain amount for exhibition purposes at both the Nashville and Omaha expositions ample provision should be made for bringing out the features and excellences of our public school system.</p>
        <p>There is no longer any question of Arkansas' mineral, timber, agricultural and horticultural resources, but it is in evidence that not enough is known of our excellent and successful public school system to become an inducement for strangers to settle in the state.</p>
    <p>An amendment to the bill should be introduced setting apart a certain amount that would in reason cover the expense necessary to a creditable exhibit of the public school work of the state; and the money so appropriated should be assigned to the control of the state; and the money so appropriated should be assigned to the control of the state superintendent of public instruction, whose experience and position make him the best judge of what is required to make a successful school exhibit.</p>
        <p>Surprise has been expressed that nothing was heard of our public schools at the Atlanta exposition. Inquiry at Superintendent Jordan's office brings out the reason. It appears that out of $10,000 appropriated to make an exhibit of the mineral, timber, agricultural and educational resources of the state the commissioner set apart only $500 for the use of the department of education. This was insufficient and in the present bill ample provisions should be made for this department.</p>
    <p>Shulenberg (Tex.) Sticker: The managers of the Transmississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha in the year 1898 are at this early day doing a great deal of work. They claim that it will be the greatest advertisement for the states in the Mississippi valley and of the west that has ever been attempted. The intention is to show what said states are capable of manufacturing and producing, and in that way bring capital and labor from the north and east. The managers say that millions of people will visit the exposition and come for the purpose of home-seeking and to invest their spare capital. We earnestly hope that the exposition will be a complete success.</p>
<p>Alamosa (Colo.) Independent-Journal: The great Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha from June to November, 1898, will excel, if anything, the World's fair at Chicago. The government has recognized it and will give financial support to the project. Foreign countries will have representatives and exhibits on a large scale. The silver palace will be one of the greatest attractions, where the mineral wealth of the world will have a representative display. Being so near Colorado it can almost be considered a home enterprise. The Colorado legislature will probably be called upon to contribute to have Colorado and her wonderful resources will represented. This should be done not scantily or grudgingly, but liberally, for every dollar contributed to this enterprise will return to the state one hundredfold.</p>
<p>Creston (Ia.) Advertise: A very strong and commendable effort is being put forward by Omaha to work up enthusiasm in the Transmississippi and International Exposition, set for dates from June to November, 1898, in the city of Omaha, the coming western metropolis. This exposition is one which can be made of untold benefit to the entire west and the great Mississippi valley in particular, and is worthy of the encouragement of the citizens of Iowa. Union county, the home of the great Blue Grass palace movement, which did so much for southwest Iowa, cannot afford to be behind in this movement, but should make all preparations to be in it. The Board of Supervisors should take the subject up, appoint a committee to arrange a display from this county and appropriate a sum to properly advertise the advantages of the county at that exposition.</p>
        <p>Searcy (Ark.) Citizen: In conformity with the recommendation of ex-Governor Clarke, a bill has been introduced in the Arkansas legislature appropriating $25,000 for an exhibit of the resources and productive industries of Arkansas at the Transmississippi and International Exposition of 1898 at Omaha. Iowa has already made a preliminary appropriation for the purpose, and will increase it later on. A bill is pending before the Illinois legislature providing for an appropriation of $100,000, while Nebraska is considering a bill carrying $350,000, which, it is said, will pass the legislature within the next ten days. Colorado, South Dakota, Kansas, Wyoming, Utah and many other western states in interest are now considering appropriation bills, and the prediction is that every state west of the Mississippi will participate in the Great exposition of 1898. The people of Omaha have subscribed over $400,000 in stock and will raise the amount to $1,000,000. Congress has pledged $200,000 and Senator Allen says this will be increased to $275,000 this session. The selection of a site for the exposition grounds is now under discussion at Omaha and it is expected that ground will be broken within thirty days.</p>
        <p>West Point (Neb.) Nebraska Volksblatt: Nearly twenty states and some southern republics are waiting what the state legislature of Nebraska will do in regard to the bill which asks $350,000 for the great exposition to be held in Omaha, and they will be guided by what Nebraska will do. It is given into the hands of our legislature whether this expositions hall be a great one, benefiting Nebraska in particular and the west in general, or not. We hope the members of the legislature will see the importance of such an exposition for Nebraska, and importance which becomes greater in view of the fact, that the exposition will be one of the great west, and we hope further that our legislature will act accordingly. Close estimates show that within the next two years at least $6,000,000 would be brought into Nebraska through the exposition, and that besides this capitalists, manufacturers and farmers would come into our state and settle here, investing their money, and this is just what we need here. But without money nothing can be accomplished in the exposition matter.</p>
    <p>Fremont, (Neb.) Platte River Zeitung: As every endeavor to develop the resources of the land is of interest to the whole nation without discrimination in favor of the party of the country where such endeavor is made, therefore the Transmississippi and International Exposition, which will beheld in Omaha next year, is of more than ordinary importance.</p>
<p>Besides showing the manifold resources of the country, and its progress in regard to industry, science, and husbandry, there will be another noticeable fact; it will be the first exposition which has ever been held west of the Mississippi river. The fact that such an exposition is to be held alone tends to show the enormous progress and growth of the far west. Not every long ago the western half of the northern party of the American continent was a desolate wilderness, inhabited by Indians, and today civilization in the broadest sense of the word has taken possession of it.</p>
<p>It is the home of a prosperous and enterprising people, whose energy is foremost directed toward tilling the soil, thereby making this great part of the country the granary of the nation. But also the manufacturing industry has found its place in it as the progress of the west has more than sufficiently proved during the last few years.</p>
<p>The plan to hold a Transmississippi Exposition in Omaha, which was greeted enthusiastically when it was first made known, has received in the meantime the section of the whole west, and the project has assumed gigantic dimensions. That the exposition may be made successful depends not only upon the innumerable resources of the west, but also upon the never resting and unyielding work of the Board of Directors.</p>
        <p>The authorized capital of the Transmississippi and International Exposition association is fixed at $1,000,000, of which $400,000 is already subscribed, while the balance will be taken up undoubtedly within the next six months.</p>
        <p>In our state legislature a bill has been introduced calling for an appropriation of $350,000 to aid the exposition.</p>
        <p>The present session of congress will without doubt increase the appropriation of $200,000 for a government exhibit at least by one-half.</p>
    <p>The aim of the exposition is to promote the welfare of the country and its people. The Platte River Zeitung therefore wishes the Transmississippi and International Exposition the greatest possible success.</p>
<p>Alma Record: The people are almost unanimously in favor of the great Omaha exposition. It means much for Omaha and it means much for Nebraska. Omaha is doing her part toward the exposition and Nebraska should respond likewise. The present legislature should make a liberal appropriation, and every citizen of the state should lend his influence and assist in making it a success. It would attract thousands and thousands of people to the state and none of them would get away without spending some money. The resources of the state could not be brought before the eastern people in better, more substantial or economical way than this. Omaha the metropolis of the state is the proper place for the exposition and no petty strife should be permitted to retard its progress.</p>
        <p>Tecumseh Chieftain: Nebraska can <choice><sic>scarcely</sic><corr>scarcely</corr></choice> expect other states to make a liberal appropriation for a display at the Transmississippi Exposition if she doesn't set them an example. The legislature has a duty to perform in this matter which ought not o be delayed. The legislatures of other states are waiting to see what Nebraska is going to do.</p>
    <p>Hastings Tribune: The Nebraska editors who are opposing the appropriation of about $300,000 by the legislature for the Transmississippi Exposition  are working against their own interests and the interests of everybody in Nebraska. We do not believe that they are sincere in what they say and therefore their words will have no weight <choice><sic>wtih</sic><corr>with</corr></choice> the matter.</p>
        <p>Madison Reporter: To all progressive men, the Nebraska legislators who are exerting themselves against the Transmississippi Exposition bill must appear as men of small caliber. This, however, is not all that might be charged against them. It might be said they were merely opposing the measure in hopes that a lobby with a good fat purse would be sent to Lincoln. This, however, will not be done, as the managers of the exposition are not in possession of the fat purse, nor will they be in the future.</p>
    <p>It is more probable, however, that opposers of the bill find a source for their opposition in the desire to gain notoriety and pose as "watchdogs of the treasury." But here is where they fall down. The people of the state are fully cognizant of the benefits to be derived from this exposition. They know it will bring thousands of people and thousands of dollars into the state, besides being the very best medium through which to advertise our state to the seekers of homes and investments. During the progress of this exposition the eyes of the whole country will be focused upon Nebraska and the result cannot be beneficial.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="main">Exposition Endorsements</head>
<head type="sub">BY THE NEBRASKA PRESS.</head>
<p>Falls City Populist: Last week we gave a few reasons why the state of Nebraska should take a specially active part in the Transmississippi Exposition in Omaha, and regret that time and space prevent us from giving many more this week, but one fact we wish to particularly call to the attention of every populist especially. This legislature, we are glad to say, is largely populist, and is controlled in both branches by the populist party. We, as a party, can cause a liberal appropriation to be made, which will cause most other states to make a like liberal appropriation, or we can make a small, penurious, niggardly appropriation, which will cause other states to say, If Nebraska has no more faith in the success and profit of the exposition than the small appropriation indicates they will make no appropriation and display, or at least so small that it will be of no financial value to us.</p>
<p>The opposition to this appropriation, and a liberal appropriation, say $250,000 or $200,000, is political suicide to our party and financial suicide to our state, as we have consistently claimed that more money in the hands of our people was our greatest immediate need, and any legitimate means to place that money within the reach of our people should be favored and voted for by every populist member of both houses of this legislature, regardless of the action of others, as the establishment of the exposition, the construction of massive and expensive buildings, the improvements of grounds in every way, the pavement of streets, extension and construction of new motor lines, railway and telephone connections, the vast population which would be attracted within the limits of Omaha and our state, and the expenditure of from six to sixteen million of dollars of money, directly or indirectly in property and the products of our state and the employment of labor would bring to our people more money and bring it to us quicker than by any other means that could possibly be devised by the people or legislature of our poverty-stricken state.</p>
<p>We hope that our monetary reform party, which now holds the reins of government of this state, will make no mistakes they will hereafter be compelled to explain, and that no false idea of economy may prevent it from making an appropriation which will draw to it and to our state millions of money that our people would never see without such a liberal appropriation.</p>
<p>Nebraska City Press: The eyes of all the loyal people of Nebraska are at present centered on the legislature awaiting in breathless suspense the action of that body on the Transmississippi Exposition, which will be the making of Nebraska and will in effect offset the terrors of the drouth of 1893 and 1894.</p>
<p>While the exposition will be held in Omaha it will nevertheless be a semi-national affair and will be of especial benefit to the state of Nebraska. It will be a particular advertisement to all Nebraska, and the county, city, village, precinct or individual so short-sighted to offer opposition to an enterprise the beneficial results of which are so clear is certainly deserving of a leather medal. It seems almost waste of time to take up and present the many and varied branches in which this magnificent exposition of the resources of the transmississippi states will benefit Nebraska. The percentage of gain to the amount of the investment will be ten times 16 to 1, and the percentage of increase in population and permanent capital will be equally as great.</p>
<p>The legislature should cease its dilly-dallying and trifling with little "dinky" measures when a question of such vital importance stares it in the face. The exposition bill should be passed and for the full amount of $350,000.</p>
    <p>Burwell Mascot: The Transmississippi Exposition would benefit the entire states <choice><sic>unmeasureably</sic><corr>unmeasurably</corr></choice>, and this fact is realized by a majority of the voters of Garfield county, irrespective of party, the "Eye" to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Hayes County Times: The Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha will be a great thing for Nebraska and the west. Even the state legislature should comprehend that fact.</p>
<p><note>column begins abruptly</note>$250,000. This is certainly little enough, and we are well satisfied that our people in general are in favor of a good, fair, liberal appropriation.</p>
<p>Kearney Star of Empire: Governor Silas Holcomb in his excellent message to the Nebraska legislature, January 7, gave a flowing description of the good things which may come to Nebraska and the great central and western portion of the United States, through the medium of the great Transmississippi Exposition, to be held at Omaha from June to November, 1897. He showed what congress and some other legislatures had done, and were going to do, by way of appropriation, to make it and the ends to be attained, a glorious success. Now let our Nebraska legislature do the handsome and square thing, by outdoing all other states in promoting financially, this utilitarian element for stimulating American industry and national progress. Let the people, editors and public men everywhere use their influence with their representatives to help push the good work forward. It takes united effort to bring about successful results. Stand up for Nebraska!</p>
<p>Tilden Citizen: Surely the members of the Nebraska legislature cannot fail to vote a liberal appropriation in aid of the Transmississippi Exposition if they have any regard for the future welfare and prosperity of our state. This is the best opportunity Nebraska has ever had for letting the people of the world know just what this grand commonwealth is capable of accomplishing under favorable circumstances, besides it is a Nebraska project, and if our state will not do the proper thing by making a liberal appropriation other states need scarcely be expected to go into their treasuries and expend large sums for a state display. It is safe to predict that Nebraska would soon get back, in taxes from the new industries and improvements induced to locate here by the big fair, enough to more than repay it for whatever appropriation it may make.</p>
<p>Hastings Republican: The Transmississippi Exposition not only means much for Omaha, but from an industrial, commercial, agricultural and investment standpoint. It means millions for Nebraska and the whole mid-west. It is indeed a narrow-minded policy to oppose lending it encouragement and assistance. Let it be met with <choice><sic>leberal</sic><corr>liberal</corr></choice> encouragement and endorsement on the part of all western people. Its ultimate and lasting results will be of incalculable value and worth not only to Omaha as a city, but to the whole state of Nebraska.</p>
<p>Dixon Tribune: It seems to us that the fight in the legislature against a proper appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition is very short-sighted and one that will prove of much damage to the enterprise. If our own state, that will reap the benefit, does not see fit to aid the enterprise, how can it be expected that other states will do it? We hope the false idea of economy some of our legislators have will be changed so that they are willing to give a dime and get a dollar back.</p>
<p>Kearney Hub: Said Senator Allen in the United States senate the other day, referring to the Transmississippi Exposition: "I think that the people of Nebraska have set their hearts on this exposition, and it would be regarded as a great misfortune for it to miscarry at this time. After it has been pushed along successfully thus far, we cannot stand the chagrin that would be cast upon us by letting the enterprise lapse." This is true. Yet the populists in the legislature are holding the appropriation measure back at a time when other western legislatures are in session and prompt and liberal action is necessary to enlist these states in the enterprise. Other western states cannot be expected to make appropriations for the exposition if the Nebraska legislature does not intend to. Nebraska virtually stands sponsor for this magnificent enterprise, and state pride should over-shadow anything else in providing the means for a Nebraska exhibit.</p>
<p>The refusal of the legislature to pass a bill allowing a liberal appropriation for the exposition will be a lasting reproach on the state. The people desire this appropriation and we believe will retire into political oblivion those legislators who oppose it. Indeed if they did not do so they would not be doing their duty.</p>
<p>Osceola Independent: So far as we have been able to learn the feelings of the people in this country on the question of the state making an appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition, the conviction of a large majority seems to be in favor of making an appropriation of an amount sufficiently large to allow a credible showing to be made of the resources and advantages of our state. while it is freely admitted that the present hard times make it necessary to economize at every point possible, the general impression appears to be that this is the opportunity of a lifetime for Nebraska, and one that the state cannot afford to miss.</p>
<p>Surprise Herald: The appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition still hangs fire, the <choice><sic>dufficult</sic><corr>difficult</corr></choice> part of the bill is how much shall be appropriated. there is no division on an appropriation, but there is a wonderful difference of opinion as to what the amount shall be. Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars is the amount asked for by the exposition committee. We predict that the appropriation will be $150,000, but we could be pleased to see our legislature appropriate.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">BALLOTING BY THE EXPOSITION DIRECTORY</head>
<head type="sub">Contest Over Location is Between Miller Park and Hanscom Park, and Will Probably Be Disposed of This Evening.</head>
    <div3>
<p>After a stormy session lasting over four and one-half hours, during which seventeen ballots were taken and stinging personalities were exchanged between members of the directory amid the yells and shouts of a large lobby, the exposition site is still unsettled. After a deal of parliamentary sparring a fighting minority forced an adjournment until 8 o'clock this evening when the fight will be resumed and another attempt made to secure a majority of the board in favor of either Miller or Hanscom parks as a site for the exposition.</p>
<p>At no time were there more than thirty-seven of the directory present, and these stood twenty-one in favor of Miller and sixteen in favor of Hanscom park. Ballot after ballot was taken without any material change in this vote, and then the minority won its point and forced an adjournment under an arrangement whereby a full vote of the board of directors will be secured.</p>
<p>The meeting was held in the large room on the second floor of the Board of Trade building in order that the lobby might have plenty of room, and the wisdom of this course was manifest when the lobby began to appear. It filled the vacant space behind the directors' chairs until the onlookers were packed in like sardines. In the crowd were business men and laboring men, men of

moderate means who had subscribed their mite, and men of large wealth who had not subscribed a cent; mechanics who were anxious to have the preliminaries settled and work commenced, and men who would rather live on charity than work.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">BOOMERS IN EVIDENCE.</head>
        <p>Mingling in the crowd, and forming a large portion of it, were the advocates of the several sites tendered as locations for the exposition, and they took an active hand in the business of the meeting. Among the supporters of the several sites were a number of persons who industriously labored with the directors during the progress of the balloting, and some of this work was successful in changing a few votes, as developed during the progress of the meeting. The lobby was as noisy as it was numerous, and the voices of the speakers were frequently drowned in the uproar of the lobby as it expressed its approval or disgust at the remarks made upon the floor. The president was obliged to frequently call the lobby to order and give notice that the hall would be cleared unless the spectators were less demonstrative.</p>
        <p>The meeting was held in pursuance of the adjournment taken last Saturday, when it was decided to defer action upon the selection of a site until yesterday, that all of the directors might have an opportunity to carefully study the several sites in the light of the report of the outside engineers employed to examine them and report to the board. When the roll was called at 2 o'clock there was not a quorum present, and it was necessary to wait a few moments. As soon as a quorum was secured the minutes were read and the absentees continued to appear.</p></div3>
    <div3>
        <head type="sub">TROUBLE PRECIPITATED.</head>
        <p>Thirty members were present when Z. T. Lindsey arose to offer a resolution providing that a majority vote of the entire board should be necessary before any site could be chosen, and providing, also, that the vote should be taken by written ballot.</p>
    <p>this precipitated a fight which lasted until long after the gas jets threw a sickly glimmer over the scene. The lines were drawn at once and they remained drawn until the meeting adjourned. This motion was taken as a slap at the Miller park people, and they resented it.</p>
<p>John C. Wharton, who developed into the leader of the Miller park forces, opposed the motion, saying it was unfair. He said that many of the directors were out of the city and others had remained in order to be present at the meeting, and he said that it was unreasonable to defer the selection of a site until a full attendance of the board was secured. He insisted that a majority of the board was all that was necessary to transact business and a majority of that quorum should select the site.</p>
<p>John L. Webster and J. H. Millard opposed the motion because they said it meant more delay and they advocated immediate action.</p>
<p>Mr. Lindsey said it would be ridiculous to leave such an important question as the selection of a site to a bare quorum of the board and thus throw the matter into the hands of fourteen or fifteen men.</p>
        <p>President Wattles took the floor to oppose the resolution, saying that all members of the board had ample notice of the meeting and if they were not present it was not the fault of those who had come to the meeting. He advised the rejection of the resolution.</p>
<p>General Manderson opposed the position taken be the president, and predicted that if the question of a site were not decided by the vote of a majority of the entire board for one site there would be great dissatisfaction and the exposition would suffer. He opposed allowing a majority of thirty-three men to decide the location.</p>
        <p>Ex-Governor Saunders charged that the resolution was simply brought in for the purpose of delay and he opposed it.</p>
        <p>There were applause and yells from the lobby at the conclusion of Saunders' remarks, and President Wattles cautioned the spectators that the room would be cleared unless they refrained from making so much noise.</p>
        <p>A vote was taken upon the resolution and a roll call was taken, resulting as follows: Ayes, 16; nays, 20. It was declared lost.</p>
        <p>The president announced that the special order of the meeting would be taken up and he said the supporters of each site would be given ten minutes in which to present the points in favor of their site.</p>
    <p>On motion of General Manderson the sites were called in alphabetical order.</p>
        <p>East Omaha was called first, but no one appeared to defend the claims of that location.</p></div3>
    <div3>
    <head type="sub">FOUR SITES ARE CHAMPIONED.</head>
        <p>Elmwood park was called next and W. R. Bennett read a paper setting forth at length the advantages presented by the site which includes Elmwood park and the State fair grounds. At the conclusion of his remarks Mr. Bennett handed the secretary a bond complying with the resolution adopted by the board at its meeting Saturday, protecting the exposition association against any expense or trouble in connection with the possession of the grounds tendered or in securing access to the grounds for railways, etc. The bond was for $5,000 and was signed by the Omaha Fair and Speed association, by W. R. Bennett, also by O. J. Pickard and J. A. Weaver.</p>
        <p>When Hanscom park was called W. J. Connell appeared and made a strong talk, in which he presented the claims of the site nearest to the center of the city. In closing Mr. Connell presented a bond for $10,000 issued by himself, complying with the resolution heretofore referred to.</p>
    <p>The merits of Miller park were presented by R. W. Richardson in a flowery speech describing the beauties of his favorite site and he presented a bond for $5,000, signed by W. A. Saunders and A. T. Rector.</p>
        <p>E. J. Cornish presented the claims or Riverview park in an extended argument, and presented a bond for $5,000, signed by E. J. Cornish, E. Stuht, John Powers, W. H. Hanchett, A. E. Walkup and W. F. Lorenzen.</p>
        <p>After the part of the proceedings had been dispatched Lucius Wells, the member of the board from Council Bluffs, moved that the roll be called and that each member express his preference. This was adopted after it had been amended to provide for the reading of the bonds before a vote was taken.</p>
    <p>At this point C. S. Montgomery attempted to force a recess of fifteen minutes. This was voted down and then he moved that the taking of a vote on the selection of a site be postponed until next Saturday. Hisses and cat-calls from the lobby drowned Mr. Montgomery's explanation of his position, but he stood his ground and insisted on his motion. The chair ruled him out of order and then he moved that the board adjourn until Saturday. This forced a vote, but the motion was defeated by a decided majority.</p>
        <p>The bonds offered by the advocates of the several sites were then read.</p></div3>
    <div3>
        <head type="sub">MAJORITY VOTE REQUIRED.</head>
    <p>As the president was about to order the roll called on the selection of a site, General Manderson offered a resolution providing that, upon a vote being taken, a majority of the whole board should be necessary to constitute a choice and that, as the balloting proceeded, the site receiving the lowest vote should be dropped until only two sites remained, and that balloting should then proceed until one of those sites should receive a majority of the votes of the full board.</p>
        <p>In support of this resolution General Manderson made a strong speech in which he urged the directors to proceed carefully in deciding the most important question which had yet come before the board. He advised that such a course should be pursued as would insure a full and fair expression of the members of the board and avoid any ill feeling. He said that if the advocates of any particular site felt sure of a majority of those present, but were afraid to trust the fate of their site to the test of twenty-six votes, that fact was the strongest evidence why the greatest care should be exercised in selecting a site.</p>
        <p>Mr. Webster objected to having this matter brought up after it had already been voted down in the same meeting, and he insinuated that "there must be something behind it."</p>
    <p>"The only thing behind it, Mr. Webster," exclaimed General Manderson, "is that you and other shall be fair in this matter."</p>
        <p>After the applause which greeted this sally had subsided Mr. Webster made an impassioned speech in which he urged immediate action. In the course of his remarks, Mr. Webster adverted to the remarks which had been made at a previous meeting regarding the Chicago engineers employed to examine the sites, and read a telegram from Thomas F. Johnson, who signed himself as president of the Western Society of Civil Engineers of Chicago, in which he referred in terms of high praise to A. C. Schrader, one of the engineers in question. Continuing, Mr. Webster contended that a vote should be taken at once and that a majority of those present should be sufficient to choose a site. He closed by moving to amend the resolution offered by General Manderson to provide that a majority of those present should be all that would be required to select a site.</p>
    <p>G. M. Hitchcock and Mr. Montgomery supported the resolution offered by General Manderson, while Mr. Saunders supported the amendment offered by Mr. Webster.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wells shut off further debate by moving the previous question. The roll call on Mr. Webster's amendment showed 16 for it and 22 against it, and the chair declared the amendment lost. The resolution was then put to a vote and adopted.</p></div3>
    <div3>
    <head type="sub">FIRST ROLL CALL ORDERED. </head>
    <p>The roll was then ordered called, each member expressing his choice as his name was called. The first ballot showed the following result: Miller park, 19 votes; Hanscom park, 13; Riverview park, 4; Elmwood park, 1.</p>
        <p>In detail, the vote stood as follows: For Miller park, Bidwell, Brandeis, Brown, Hibbard, Hussie, Jardine, Lee, Markel, Millard, Murphy, Rector, Saunders, Wattles, Webster, Weller, Wells, Wharton, Wilhelm, Yost&#8212;19; for Hanscom park, Carpenter, Dickinson, Farrell, Hitchcock, Holdrege, Johnson, Kilpatrick, Montgomery, Noyes, Payne, Price, Arthur C. Smith, Youngs&#8212;13; for Riverview park, Bruce, Kimball, Manderson, Metz, 4; for Elmwood park, Lindsey; absent, Babcock, Creighton, Evans, Kirkendall, Korty, Kountze, Lyman, Paxton, Reed, Rosewater, Dudley Smith, Thompson, Wilcox&#8212;13.</p>
        <p>The lobby, aided and abetted by several of the directors, proceeded to raise the roof in their exuberant joy at what they seemed to think was the forerunner of a brilliant and decisive victory for Miller park.</p>
        <p>It developed that this first ballot was but a preliminary skirmish for positioning, and the next ballot showed just where the shoe pinched. Under the rule Elmwood park was dropped and the second ballot commenced. Brandeis changed from Miller park to Hanscom park, and Kilpatrick changed from Hanscom park to Miller, but otherwise the original Miller park and Hanscom park men "stood pat." Bruce and Metz switched from River to Miller, and Manderson changed from Riverview to Hanscom, leaving Kimball as the only supporter of Riverview. This left the second ballot standing as follows: Miller, 21; Hanscom, 15; Riverview, 1.</p></div3>
    <div3>
        <head type="sub">ALL DROP OUT BUT TWO.</head>
    <p>Rivervew was dropped on the third ballot and Kimball voted for Hanscom park, the third ballot standing 21 and 16.</p>
        <p>The lines were then tightly drawn and ballot after ballot was taken with no material change. One or two directors "wabbled" slightly during the next few ballots, but they were steadied afterwards and no change was effected. During the taking of the fifth ballot A. L. Reed appeared and voted for Hanscom park, and while the sixth ballot was being taken F. P. Kirkendall came in and cast his vote for Hanscom park. In the meantime A. C. Smith had changed from Hanscom park to Miller park, and on the seventh ballot the vote stood 22 for Miller park and 17 for Hanscom park.</p>
    <p>The eighth and ninth ballots stood the same, and then a motion was made to adjourn until tomorrow night. This was defeated and a motion to adjourn until tonight met with a similar fate.</p>
        <p>The tenth ballot showed no change, but before the eleventh ballot could be taken General Manager Holdrege of the B &amp; M., General Manager Dickinson of the Union Pacific and Dr. E. W. Lee were called out by the news of a wreck. This took two from Hanscom and one from Miller park, the vote then standing 21 for Miller park and 15 for Hanscom.</p>
        <p>The twelfth ballot was taken with no indication of a break in the forces on either side. In the mean time the Miller park forces had been doing a little quiet caucusing on the floor and Director Wells secured the floor to make a motion to reconsider the vote whereby it had been decided that a majority of the full board should be necessary in the selection of a site.</p></div3>
    <div3>
        <head type="sub">FEELING GETTING BETTER.</head>
        <p>During the progress of the balloting a number of little pleasantries had been indulged in by the two sides, but the fire was smoldering all the time, and the motion of Mr. Wells fanned it into a flame. The air was thick with shouts designed to attract the attention of the presiding officer, but sides trying to secure the floor to speak on the motion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montgomery distanced all competitors and when quiet as restored he proceeded to roast the Miller park people in the most approved style. He accused them of trying to force a gag down the throats of the opposition and said that if the pending motion prevailed the Hanscom park men ought to leave their seats in a body and leave the meeting without a quorum. This remark was greeted with hisses and catcalls from the lobby, and it was with difficulty that order was restored.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wells defended his motion and said it was evident that those present might vote all night without any change, and he said he was desirous of securing a decision one way or another.</p>
        <p>Mr. Payne said it was important that the question of a site should be settled right and if as it could not secure a majority of the full board it had better be abandoned.</p>
    <p>Mr. Wharton argued that the matter should be settled at once as the city council was waiting to make the annual tax levy and cooed not do it until it was settled whether the exposition was to be located in one of the public parks or on private land. He proceeded to make a stump speech to the lobby, which was greeted with cheers and applause. In the course of his remarks Mr. Wharton charged that Mr. Montgomery had said that he would not pay his stock subscription unless "this thing is done thus and so."</p>
<p>Mr. Montgomery was on his feet in an instant and branded the statement as a lie, and then he explained what he had said at the time referred to by Wharton. Proceeding, Mr. Montgomery said that if a site could not get 26 votes it was not a proper location for an exposition, and then he proceeded to belabor the Miller park people again for trying to take advantage of the fact that they had a majority of the present meeting.</p>
        <p>The motion to reconsider was lost, the vote being : Ayes, 16; nays, 20.</p>
        <p>Mr. Payne then moved to adjourn until 8 o'clock. This was lost and another ballot ordered.</p>
        <p>The thirteenth ballot resulted as follows: Miller park, 20; Hanscom park, 15.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montgomery moved to adjourn until 8 o'clock, but the motion was voted down.</p>
        <p>While the fourteenth ballot was being taken Mr. Hitchcock announced that the would change his vote to Miller park, and he explained his vote by saying that he still thought Hanscom park was the best place but Miller park seemed to be the choice of a majority of the board and he did not wish to obstruct the selection of a site.</p>
    <p>On the same ballot Fred M. Youngs, the representative of organized labor, announced that he had been voting for Hanscom park under the instructions of the organized labor unions of the city, but he said he had become convinced that he had fulfilled his instructions, and would cast his vote with the majority. In doing so he said he appealed to the advocates of Miller park to assist him in his efforts in the interest of labor in connection with the exposition. Again the lobby cheered and shook the building with its stamping and pounding.</p>
        <p>After the sixteenth ballot had been taken without showing any further break in the lines, Mr. Lindsey asked that the Hanscom park people be allowed to retire to an adjoining room for consultation. This was conceded and they withdrew.</p>
    <p>When they returned to the room another ballot was taken with precisely the same result as before.</p>

<pb n="71" xml:id="TMISB02-071"/> 



<p>General Manderson then arose and said that those voting for Hanscom park had decided, after consultation, that Hanscom park was the best site the for the interests of the city and of the exposition. Because of this fixed conviction, he said, they had been voting that way, but they did not desire to stand as obstructionists. In canvassing the probable wish of the majority of the board, the speaker said the advocates of Hanscom park were of the opinion that a majority would favor Hanscom park if their opinion could be secured. The voting had shown, he said, that Miller park had 23 votes, and he was of the opinion that this represented the maximum strength of that site. He admitted, however, that Miller park might obtain a majority of the board, but the supporters of Hanscom park wanted to demonstrate positively that such was the case before yielding their position. The Hanscom park people, he said, had a proposition to submit providing for an adjournment until 8 o'clock this evening, and instructing the president or secretary, in the meantime, to telegraph every member of the directory who is out of the city, and secure his vote on the question of location as between Miller park and Hanscom park. By that means he said an expression of every member of the board would be obtained and the question be settled squarely and fairly.</p>
<p>This proposition provoked a short but very spirited discussion, and it was finally agreed to, after it had been amended to provide that any member who would be unable to be present tonight might lodge with the secretary his written ballot expressing his choice, which would be counted the same as though he were present. The vote on the proposition as thus amended was 19 ayes and 17 nays.</p>
<p>The meeting was then adjourned until 8 p.m.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">DECLINES TO PUSH THE MATTER.</head>
<head type="sub">Populist in the Senate Objects to Expediting the Exposition Bill.</head>
<p>LINCOLN, Feb. 11.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;In the senate this forenoon Mr. Murphy offered a preamble and resolution, urging the importance of speedy action on the Transmississippi Exposition bill and moved its adoption. Objection was made, however, by Graham, populist of Frontier, and the resolution went over until tomorrow under the rules. The resolution was as follows:</p>
<p>"Whereas, We believe that the Transmississippi Exposition, to be held in our proud metropolis, the great central gateway to the west, where the world can behold all the products, industries and civilization of the states west of the Mississippi river, would be of great value not only to the transmississippi states in general, but would be of incalculable value to the great state of Nebraska in particular, and,</p>
<p>"Whereas, Instead of acting promptly, in a business-like manner, and passing the appropriation bill now before this legislature within the first two weeks of this session, the whole matter has been handled from one house caucus to another and thereby held in abeyance, and other states whose legislatures are now in session and will soon adjourn, are seriously doubting whether Nebraska intends to make any appropriation for said exposition, and,</p>
<p>"Whereas, We believe further delay means defeat to the success of said exposition, is disappointing to the national government, humiliating to the people of Nebraska generally, and disastrous in the extreme in its effect upon the action of our sister states, therefore, be it</p>
<p>"Resolved, As the sense of this body, that house roll No, 93, which is the exposition bill, should be taken up and considered at once in the house by the committee of the whole and disposed of promptly in that broad-minded, business-like and public-spirited manner which the public, both in and out of this state, have a right to expect of this legislature."</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">TEACHERS WILL BE REPRESENTED.</head>
<head type="sub">Four Candidates to Be Presented to the Woman's Mass Meeting.</head>
<p>The teachers in the Omaha public schools met last night at the board rooms and held a "family council" to ascertain who they desired to support to represent them upon the woman's board of the exposition. It was decided to furnish four candidates to Friday's meeting. A committee consisting of Misses McCheane, Butterfield, Wheatly, Mrs. Lemon and Mr. Wilson brought six names before the body, from which the following four were selected: Miss McHugh, Miss Foos, Miss Hitt, and Mrs. Chittenden.</p>
<p>Although some discussion was heard on the subject of selecting representatives from outside the ranks, all those chosen are members of the present corps except Mrs. Chittenden. As nearly as four persons may do so these represent the various departments of the public work, the High school, principals and grade, special instruction and kindergartens.</p>
<p>Since the sympathy, interest and co-operation of Omaha's teachers has much to do with the success of this department of the exposition, they hope that some plan will be devised which will enable them to attend Friday's meeting and support their candidates and help to elect the other members.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">AN OPPORTUNITY THAT SHOULD BE IMPROVED.</head>
<ab>(SALT LAKE HEARLD.)</ab>
<p>This exposition should, and will if properly encouraged, invite the attention of the whole country to the possibilities of the great trans-Missouri west, and when they are fully recognized it cannot but result in a great growth for the west. Growth, growth in population and in capital, is what we want in the new state of Utah. In natural resources of all kinds this state is the peer of any in the Union. But they must be made known, and where is a better place or a more opportune time to make them known than at this Trans-Mississippi exposition? Whenever the resources of a state are exhibited within that state or in close proximity to it, interest in the state is much greater than when they are exhibited far away from it. The very fact that this Omaha exposition is to be held west of the Missouri river makes it unique and gives it an added interest. It will afford a great opportunity to make known the resources of the state, an opportunity that should be improved. It should be remembered that Omaha was once the gateway to Utah and the people of the state have always cherished a kind memory of Omaha and her people, dating back to the time when many of them started from there in the '40s. Let Utah do what she can to make its exposition a success, and the greater its success, the greater the benefits that will inure from it to this state. It is a matter demanding the attention of the legislature.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Factions Shake Hands and Everybody Will Now Work Hard to Make the Big Show a Success.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The Transmississippi and International Exposition will be located in Miller park. This was decided by the first ballot at the meeting of the Board of Directors last night and the Miller park site had two votes more than a majority of the full board. The vote of every member of the board was cast upon the question of location, and after the result was announced the choice was made unanimous, and every member of the board by a rising vote signified his acquiescence to the will of the majority. Led by the advocates of Hanscom park, three rousing cheers were given for Miller park, in which the members of the board and the crowd of spectators vied with each other to see who could cheer the hardest. The meeting wound up with a love feast in which the utmost good feeling prevailed.</p>
<p>The result was not reached without a preliminary parliamentary skirmish, however, in which the liens between the advocates of the two sites under consideration were closely drawn. These by-plays occupied the time of the meeting over an hour before a vote on the selection of a site was taken, but during the progress of these skirmishes the position of the doubtful directors was disclosed and the result of the final vote was anticipated.</p>
<p>The meeting was held in the large hall in the Board of Trade building, as before, and the lobby was larger than it was on Tuesday night. There were fully 600 spectators present, and they crowded around the sides of the room and filled the rear of the hall until there was scarcely breathing room. As at the meeting the night before, the lobby took part in the proceedings in the way of furnishing the noise and applause, but it was very evident that the sentiment of the large majority of those in the audience was in favor of Miller park, and the advocates of Hanscom park received cold comfort <note>column ends abruptly</note></p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">ABSENT DIRECTORS PAIRED OFF.</head>
<p>When President Wattles called the meeting to order every member of the directory was present in person or by written ballot deposited with the secretary. Thirty-six members answered to their names at roll call and the following named members who were absent had sent in their ballots by letter or by wire: Babcock, Bidwell, Lee, Markel, Paxton, Wells and Wilcox instructed the secretary to cast their votes for Miller park, and Dickinson, Evans, Kirkendall, Korty, Rosewater, Dudley Smith and Thompson instructed the secretary to cast their votes in favor of Hanscom park.</p>
<p>These instructions left only Creighton, Kountze and Lyman, all of whom had been absent the night before, on the doubtful list and the interest centered about the way their votes should be cast. If all the members who had been present the night before "stood pat" the Miller park people had twenty-six votes without these three, but there was at least one on the Miller park list who was regarded as doubtful and this made the course to be taken by the three named as of the utmost importance to the advocates of both sites.</p>
<p>President Wattles announced that the first business in order would be the calling of the roll on the selection of a site.</p>
<p>T. T. Lindsey said that before a vote was taken he would move that when balloting was resumed the method of voting be changed and that each member, as his name was called, should deposit a written ballot expressing his choice of a site, and that when twenty-six votes had been cast for any site that he declared the choice of the board.</p>
<p>This motion precipitated a discussion which lasted over half an hour.</p>
<p>Mr. Lindsey explained his motion by saying that there were directors present who were known to be voting contrary to their honest convictions, and all that was desired to accomplish by his motion was the securing of an honest expression of sentiment from every director.</p>
<p>John L. Webster raised the point of order that the motion was out of order for the reason that the board had already determined the course to be pursued in taking the vote on a site.</p>
<p>The chair sustained the point of order and ruled the motion out, saying that the only way in which the method of voting could be changed was by reconsidering the vote whereby the resolution offered by General Manderson had been adopted, and he ruled that a motion to reconsider would require a two-thirds majority.</p>
<p>General Manderson and G. M. Hitchcock contended that the construction put upon the resolution of General Manderson was erroneous, and they claimed that the resolution in question provided simply that a ballot should be taken, without specifying the manner of voting.</p>
<p>The president declined to recede from his position, and then Mr. Lindsey moved to reconsider the vote whereby the resolution provided for a ballot on sites had been adopted.</p>
<p>Mr. Webster said this would wipe out all that had been done under that resolution, and a long discussion ensued on the motion, after which Mr. Lindsey, seeing that there was no chance of carrying his point, withdrew his motion to reconsider.</p>
<p>C.S. Montgomery at once revived the subject by moving that the ballot on a site be taken in writing.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">PRESIDENT IS SUSTAINED.</head>
<p>The chair renewed the former ruling and declared the motion out of order. Mr. Montgomery appealed from the decision of the chair, and the chair was sustained.</p>
<p>Again a <note>column ends abruptly</note>

<pb n="72" xml:id="TMISB02-072"/> 

called E. C. Price moved that G. W. Holdrege be allowed to address the meeting briefly on the accessibility of Hanscom park by means of the railroads.</p>
<p>The chair ruled the motion out of order, but Mr. Manderson protested against the ruling. He said the board of directors was not the house of representatives of congress, and was not working under the strict order of parliamentary law, and he insisted that the board give the matter under consideration the free and full discussion which its importance merited. He said all matters in the hands of the board should be held open for discussion as long as any member desired to express his opinion.</p>
<p>Alvin Saunders said that if the supporters of one site were allowed to argue the merits of their site he would call upon the supporters of every other site to speak about their sites.</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchcock moved that the Street Railway company be given ten minutes to present the advantages of Miller park from a transportation standpoint and that Mr. Holdrege be allowed the same time to present the advantages of Hanscom park from a railroad standpoint.</p>
<p>The motion was ruled out of order.</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchcock appealed from the ruling of the chair and made a warm speech in which he referred to the importance of the matter under consideration and insisted that all interests be given a full hearing.</p>
<p>The vote being taken the chair held that it had been sustained, but a division was called for, and the roll call showed 15 ayes and 20 nays, and the chair was reversed, Mr. Hitchcock's motion was then carried, the roll call showing 18 ayes to 17 nays.</p>
<p>Frank Murphy, president of the Street Railway company, was called for, but he contented himself with remarking that he had nothing to say, that Miller park spoke for itself and he would take his chances on getting there with his street cars after a vote was taken.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">HANSCOM PARK AND RAILROADS.</head>
<p>Mr. Holdrege, general manager of the B. &amp; M., was called for and surprised his most intimate friends by making a speech. He said that the report of the engineers showed on its face that it had been made hurriedly and he characterized as untrue their statement that tracks for construction purposes could not be laid on the grounds to connect with the present railway tracks. He said it would be a very easy matter to lay tracks to any point on the grounds from a connection with the Belt line near the north line of the poor farm. With reference to the accessibility of the grounds during the holding of the exposition. Mr. Holdrege said that he felt satisfied that the great majority of the people coming to Omaha at that time would be landed down town at the depots, and he dwelt upon the disadvantage of travelling nine miles on the street cars to reach Miller park. He also stated that he could see no way in which the Union Pacific, B. &amp; M., Rock Island or Milwaukee roads could reach Miller park, as none of these roads have tracks in the north part of the city. All of these roads, he said, could reach Hansom park by switching their trains to the Belt line at the Summit.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of Mr. Holdrege's remarks the lobby hissed and hooted him in a most disgraceful manner and it was some time before the president could make himself hear above the uproar. HE repeated the warning used frequently the night before, to the effect that the hall would be cleared of spectators unless order was maintained.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">FINAL ROLL CALL ORDERED.</head>
<p>The president then ordered the roll called on the selection of a site. There were no further motions and the roll call proceeded, with the following result:</p>
<p>For Miller Park&#8212;Babcock, Bidwell, Brown, Bruce, Creighton, Hibbard, Hussie, Jardine, Kilpatrick, Kountze, Lee, Lyman, Markel, Metz, Millard, Murphy, Paxton, Rector, Saunders, Wattles, Webster, Weller, Wells, Wharton, Wilcox, Willhelm, Yost, Youngs&#8212;28.</p>
<p>For Hanscom Park&#8212;Brandeis, Carpenter, Dickinson, Evans, Farrell, Hitchcock, Holdrege, Johnson, Kimball, Kirkendall, Korty, Lindsey, Manderson, Montgomery, Noyes, Payne, Price, Reed, Rosewater, Arthur Smith, Dudley Smith, Thompson&#8212;22.</p>
<p>When John A. Creighton announced his vote for Miller park there was a slight ripple of applause and this was increased when Herman Kountze followed suit. This virtually decided the matter, but there was no demonstration until after the secretary had announced the result, and then the Miller park directors and the entire lobby joined in one grand shout which threatened to raise the roof. The air was thick with hats, canes and other movables and pandemonium reigned. </p>
<p>When quiet was restored General Manderson moved that Miller park be made the unanimous choice of the board of directors. A rising vote was called for and every director rose to his feet.</p>
<p>As a climax W. J. Connell; one of the spectators who had been the warm supporter of Hanscom park site, called for three cheers for Miller park. They were given with a will, everybody joining in, and then the meeting adjourned itself.</p>
<p>The advocates of the two sites shook hands after it was all over and the best of feeling was manifested on both sides.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="main">WOMEN AND THE EXPOSITION</head>
<head type="sub">SELECTION OF LADY BOARD OF MANAGERS</head>
<head type="sub">Forty Candidates for the Eleven Positions to be Filled at the Meeting to Be Held Next Friday Afternoon.</head>
<p>The women of Omaha will hold a mass meeting in the Creighton theater tomorrow afternoon to elect eleven members of the Board of Lady Managers of the Transmississippi and International Exposition. Every woman in the city who has an interest in the success of the exposition, and especially in that part of it to be governed by the women, is entitled to a voice and a vote in the meeting.</p>
<p>An impression has obtained in some quarter that the whole connection of women with the exposition has been in the hands of the Woman's club of this city and will continue to be managed by members of that organization. It is true that the plan adopted by the executive committee of the exposition association was drafted by a committee appointed by the Woman's club for that purpose, but it is questionable if the plan can be regarded as the child of the Woman's club, as that organization has never been officially notified that  a plan was in existence, and has never acted on any plan. The committee appointed by the club went ahead on its own responsibility and prepared a plan which was presented to executive committee of the exposition and approved by that body without having received the approval of the Woman's club, so that the plan is the creation of the executive committee to all intents and purposes.</p>
<p>This plan has been printed in full in The Bee, and it provides for a Board of Lady Managers to consist of eleven women from Omaha, two from South Omaha, two from Council Bluffs and two from each of the six congressional districts in Nebraska. After these women are elected they are to elect their officers from among their own number. The Board of Lady Managers is to have charge of the Bureau of Education under the Department of Exhibits, and all the acts of the board are to be subject to the approval of the executive committee of the exposition.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the details of the women's connection with the exposition there has been a lively interest manifested in the meeting to be held tomorrow, and a lively skirmish to center on desirable candidates. The interest displayed among the women of the city has been unprecedented, and the result is that there is a large field of candidates from which to choose. There are over forty women who are available candidates, not in any offensive sense, but they have yielded to the pressure brought to bear upon them by their friends and have manifested a willingness to fulfill the duties of the office if elected. It will be seen, therefore, that there is plenty of room for a lively time at the meeting, and the affair promises to be a most animated gathering. None of those interested have made any attempt to estimate the probable attendance, but it is expected that the theater will be crowded from pit to dome.</p>
<p>The meeting will be called to order by President Wattles of the Exposition association, who will preside until a chairman is selected, unless the meeting sees fit to retain him as the presiding officer during the proceedings.</p>
<p>As order of business has already been formulated by the executive committee of the exposition and will be recommended to the women's meeting. There seems to be every probability that the plan will be followed, as no sentiment against it has developed up to this time. This plan provides that an informal ballot shall first be taken, each woman present voting for eleven women. This vote will then be counted and the twenty-two women receiving the highest vote on this ballot shall be declared elected. This method will give every woman present an opportunity of voting on the first ballot for anyone she pleases. There will be no verbal nominations and, consequently, no nominating speeches. It is estimated that the counting of the votes cast on the first ballot will consume several hours and it has been suggested that an adjournment be taken until some day early next week before taking the second ballot in order to give the tellers ample time to count the ballots and announce the result. Just what will be done in this regard will be determined by the meeting itself.</p>
<p>As stated heretofore, there are a number of candidates in the field. At least two tickets have appeared, and it is reported that other tickets will be circulated at the meeting. The tickets already announced each contain the names of more than eleven women, one containing twenty-two names and the other nineteen. Both tickets will be printed, and it will be necessary for each woman voting to scratch out the names of those for whom she does not wish to vote. Additional names may be written on the ballots with lead pencil or with ink, or an entire ticket may be written. The ballot being purely informal, and for the purpose of nominating candidates, any one may be voted for, regardless of whether the name appears on any of the printed tickets or not. For this purpose every woman attending the meeting should provide herself with a lead pencil and some blank paper.</p>
<p>One of the tickets now if the field contains the following names: Mesdames Ed A. Cudahy, Will B. Millard, Thomas L. Kimball, James H. McIntosh, N. P. Fell, A. N. Ferguson, W. W. Keysor, T. K. Sudborough, John Gordon, William Fleming, Clark Woodman, Dr. Cuscaden, James W. Van Nostrand, W. P. Harford, S. R. Towne, H. W. Yates, Marlette Shields Chittenden, Misses Margaret Boyd, Anna Foos, Kat McHugh and Alice Hitte.</p>
<p>The other ticket contains the following names: Mesdames Frank Haller, Frances M. Ford, W. P. Harrod, Mary Girard Andrews, G. M. Hitchcock, Ed A. Cudahy, C. C. Belden, J. N. Cornish, Alvin Saunders, Clark Woodman, J. A. Gillespie, John S. Briggs, W. S. Strawn, N. P. Fell, James H. McIntosh, T. L. Kimball, H. S. Jaynes, Charles Rosewater, Hainer and Miss Elizabeth Shirley.</p>
<p>The first of these tickets contains the names of eleven women who are members of the Woman's club, and the second ticket contains the names of nine club members.</p>
<p>In addition to the names appearing on these tickets the Nebraska Ceramic club has presented the name of Mrs. Euclid Martin for election as a member of the board. There are also other names which will be publicly announced, at or before the meeting, so that there will be no lack of candidates. Among the other names which will probably be presented is that of the honored wife of ex-Senator Manderson. Mrs. Manderson has been very generally mentioned in connection with the office of president of the Board of Lady Managers, and she has not declined the proffered honor, although she has not signified her acceptance.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Women of the City Are Getting Ready for the Election This Afternoon.</head>
<head type="sub">No Qualification for the Voting Is Required Except Interest in the Exposition.</head>
<head type="sub">Probable That Several Tickets Will be in the Field&#8212;List of Candidates&#8212;Teachers Represented.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The mass meeting of the women of the city to elect eleven members of the board of lady managers of the Trans-Mississippi exposition will be held in the Creighton theater this afternoon at 2 o'clock.</p>
<p>All women who take an interest in the matter, whether they or their husbands are subscribers to stock or not, will be entitled to vote. The meeting will be under the auspices solely of the executive committee of the exposition directory. It is anticipated that perhaps 1,000 will attend.</p>
<p>Considerable talk has been had with regard to candidates, and at least one printed ticket containing twenty-two names will be distributed. This ticket:</p>

<lg>
    <l>Mrs. T. L. Kimball,</l>
    <l>Mrs. J. H. McIntosh,</l>
    <l>Miss Kate McHugh,</l>
    <l>Mrs. N. P. Feil,</l>
    <l>Mrs. Ed Cudahy,</l>
    <l>Miss Alice Hitte,</l>
    <l>Mrs. A. N. Ferguson,</l>
    <l>Mrs. John Gordon,</l>
    <l>Mrs. Dr. Cuscaden,</l>
    <l>Mrs. J. W. Van Nostrand,</l>
    <l>Mrs. T. K. Sodborough,</l>
    <l>Mrs. H. W. Yates,</l>
    <l> Mrs. Dr. Towne,</l>
    <l>Mrs. W. W. Keysor,</l>
    <l>Mrs. Orietta Shields Chittenden,</l>
    <l>Miss Anna Foos,</l>
    <l>Mrs. W. B. Millard,</l>
    <l>Miss Margaret Boyd,</l>
    <l>Mrs. William Fleming,</l>
    <l>Mrs. Clark Woodman,</l>
    <l>Mrs. Holyoke,</l>
    <l>Mrs. W. P. Harford.</l>
</lg>


<p>Four of these candidates, Miss McHugh, Miss Foos, Miss Hitte and Mrs. Chittenden, were nominated by the city teachers at a meeting Wednesday afternoon. The meeting was called by Superintendent Pearse, who said that inasmuch as very many of the teachers had taken stock and the work to be given to the board of lady managers was work in which the teachers were professionally engaged, it was eminently proper that they should be represented

<pb n="73" xml:id="TMISB02-073"/> 



on the board.</p>
<p>A committee consisting of Mrs. Lizzie Roudebush and Misses Shirley, LaRue and Morgan was appointed to present these names to the mass meeting and it is understood that the candidates will receive the unanimous support of the teachers.</p>
<p>But other names will be brought before the meeting. Mrs. Morrell, secretary of the Nebraska Ceramic club will on behalf of that club nominate Mrs. Euclid Martin. Another name mentioned is that of Mrs. Dr. Rosewater, and it is certain that many more candidates will be presented at the meeting. There is a feeling on the part of some that the Woman's club through the action of its individual members is trying to assume the direction of the election, but this is denied and attention drawn to the fact that not more than half of the candidates mentioned are members of the club.</p>
<p>The meeting will be called to order by President Wattles of the exposition, and then the women will probably choose their own chairman and proceed as they like, though it has been suggested by the executive committee that on the first ballot each woman vote for eleven candidates and that the twenty-two receiving the highest number of votes be considered the candidates on the second ballot it is thought that the election may not be completed at one <choice><sic>sesion</sic><corr>session</corr></choice>. All are asked to come provided with pencils.</p>
<p>Sentiment as to who the president of the board shall be after it has been elected has not crystallized. There was some talk for a time of Mrs. Manderson, but it is said that she will not accept the position.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">DELEGATIONS TO LEGISLATURES.</head>
<p>Arrangements for the sending of delegations to the several state legislatures are in progress, and will probably be completed today. This much <choice><sic>as</sic><corr>has</corr></choice> been agreed on, that Messrs. Wattles, Hitchcock and a few others will leave Sunday night for Topeka, where they will be Monday. They are due at Denver Tuesday, at Cheyenne Wednesday and at Salt Lake Friday. From there a part of the delegation will probably go on to the Pacific coast states and return through the northern tier of states.</p>
<p>Secretary Wakefield has arranged for the streamers that will be stretched along the sides of the cars. Each one will be three feet wide and fifty feet long and will bear in large letters:</p>

<head type="sub">Select Two of their Number to Represent the</head>
<head type="sub">Magic City of the Board of Lady Managers</head>
<head type="sub">Of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition.</head>
<p>One would think there was a presidential election or a Bradley Martin ball on hand from the number of caucuses being held by the ladies to boom the candidacy of certain females for the board of lady managers. The fight has got down to that condition where the ladies talk of factions, boodle and coercion with as much fluency as they do of each other's social standings. While the idea is to select some one who is not only a "good woman," but who is able to do the work demanded with an exceptional degree of enlightenment it is not deterring nearly every member of the softer sex in the city from trying to get in her oar. Yesterday and today many of the dear creatures made a house to house canvass for support and went through all the little jollies incident to professional vote getting. Some of them thought they ought to be elected because they once got a prize for making a mince pie that wouldn't promote indigestion; others that they had lived in South Omaha so long that they were surely entitled to some reward; others wanted to be elected because they were the original new women crusaders; <choice><sic>othere</sic><corr>others</corr></choice> because they knew how to get off a street car without attracting the attention of all the men in creation; others on the ground that they had never applied for a divorce; a few knew they should have it because they could beat the universe playing whist; one or two wanted it because they were "nice old women," and four or five considered they should have it because their names appeared quite often in the papers.</p>
<p>Tomorrow will be a blazing hot day, indeed. The women are all worked up and there is not a hall in the city that will hold them. Some of the men are going to leave the city until the fun is over; others will leave for good unless their wives are elected.</p>
<p>Mesdames Towl, Mead, Munro, Talbot, Watts and Carroll appear to be the leading candidates. This afternoon Mrs. Towl's friends will hold a caucus, as will also Mrs. Mead's. The idea of selecting both a Catholic and a Protestant lady, as suggested by the <choice><sic>TRIBTNE</sic><corr>TRIBUNE</corr></choice> yesterday, is generally approved and will doubtlessly be adopted. Mesdames Carroll, Tanner and Geary are the most prominent women suggested from the Catholic ranks and any one of them would be a credit to the city.</p>
<p>Some of the women are stirred up because Omaha women have been brought to the city to work up the candidacy of one of the ladies. Mrs. W. S. White is another lady who has many friends for one of the positions.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">MUCH OPPOSITION PROMISED.</head>
<head type="sub">Exposition Appropriation Will Be Fought in House and Senate.</head>
<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
<p>Washington, D. C., Feb. 11.&#8212;Although the house appropriation committee has recommended in the sundry civil bill the item appropriating $200,000 for the Omaha exposition, the friends of the great Trans-Mississippi show are not so confident that the appropriation will not meet with a stormy passage and possibly defeat.</p>
<p>Representative Hainer of the appropriation committee thinks the provision will pass the house. The danger just now appears to be in the senate.</p>
<p>The opponents of the appropriation have been very industrious in working up an antagonistic sentiment at both sides of the capitol, on the plea that the provisions so far made by the Nebraska legislature and the state generally in aid of the exposition are altogether disproportionate to the amount which the people of the United States are asked to put up.</p>
<p>Hainer represents the sanguine sentiment of the house. Others are not so sure of its passing the lower branch, and utterly despair of being able to secure the consent of the two houses increasing the amount to $275,000.</p></div2>
    
<div2 type="article">    
<head type="sub">RANSOM IS ELOQUENT.</head>
<p>Senator Ransom wondered why any senator could do anything to hinder or retard the exposition. Would men never get over the idea that the map of their county was a map of the world. He scored men who were opposed to showing to the whole world the beauty and grandeur of Nebraska. He said when the president of the exposition asked Grover Cleveland to issue a proclamation to the world that the exposition would be held the president declined to thus proclaim, and instead thereof Secretary Olney had advised the very action embodied in the resolution, and had agreed to place the governor's invitation in the hands of every foreign ambassador.</p>
<p>Senator Gondring again arose and denied being opposed to the exposition, but insisted that it was a plan to hold up the senate for a greater appropriation than the state can afford. No action was taken upon either motion, and the senate took an adjournment until 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Outside Papers Devote Space to the Big Show.</head>
<p>The press of California and the Pacific coast states is devoting considerable space to the Transmississippi Exposition. The metropolitan dailies of Portland, Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles have commended the enterprise editorially and have published much descriptive matter concerning it. The papers of smaller towns on the coast have been no less liberal. There is every promise of a large appropriation by the California legislature. The San Francisco Chronicle of Sunday, February 7, published a full page, finely illustrated write-up of the exposition, copy for which was furnished by the press bureau. Pictures of prominent public buildings in Omaha and a view in Hanscom park embellish the article, which is largely made up of a chronicle of what has been done by the promoters of the exposition, a description of Omaha and an epitome of the wealth and resources of the west. It is by far the strongest advertisement of the exposition that has appeared in the western press, which, generally speaking, has shown a spirit of liberality in treating of the enterprise.</p>
<p>The eastern press is becoming aroused to the importance of the project. The Buffalo Illustrated Sunday Express will tomorrow contain a full-page write-up of the exposition, with half-tone illustrations upon book-print paper, and will doubtless prove to be the most artistic publication which has to date been made with reference to the exposition. The Chicago Inter Ocean will, Monday morning, contain a page of illustrated matter about the exposition, while the Chicago Sunday Chronicle will tomorrow present an exhaustive illustrated article about the big show. Other influential papers of the east and south have also given space to the recent issues of the press bureau.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">Contest Getting Interesting.</head>
<p>Several caucuses were held by the women yesterday in an attempt to arrive at some understanding in the matter of selecting two women for the woman's board of the exposition. Every club, clique and faction has its candidates, and the fight has broken into religion. The fight at the meeting this afternoon will be a warm one, as friends of the candidates will be there in force. It would be a hard matter to predict who will win, since there is so much feeling in the matter.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><dateline>OMAHA, NEBRASKA, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1897.<lb/>THE WORLD-HERALD:</dateline>
    <head type="main">STOP THE CHILDS PLAY.</head>
<p>That was a remarkable resolution which Senator Murphy, republican, introduced in the senate yesterday. To be sure the resolution could very readily be ruled out on a point of order, and probably will be so ruled, for it contains a criticism of the other branch of the legislative body. At the same time this is an important resolution, and ought to be thoroughly digested by the people of Nebraska regardless of politics. The resolution is as follows:</p>
<p>Whereas, The national government at Washington has shown its appreciation of the Trans-Mississippi region and its confidence in the business integrity and public spirit of Nebraska by appropriating $200,000 to the Trans-Mississippi exposition, and,</p>
<p>Whereas, Many of our sister states have already made preliminary appropriations, with the assurance of large appropriations later, and,</p>
<p>Whereas, A number of other states are ready to join Nebraska in this great demonstration of western resources and western energy, and,</p>
<p>Whereas, The proposed Trans-Mississippi exposition is an undertaking laudable and worthy and is earnestly desired by all progressive people of this state, regardless of political ambition or party creed, and,</p>
<p>Whereas, At a banquet given by the people of Omaha to the governor of this state and other newly elected state officials recently, they did openly promise and pledge prompt action and a liberal appropriation by the fusion majority in control in this legislature, and,</p>
<p>Whereas, The governor of this state in a public interview sent through the association press, gave to the country at large the assurance that the political party now in control of this state was not a party of retrogression and repudiation, but a party of progress and public spirit, and,</p>
<p>Whereas, The Hon. W. V. Allen, the leader of the fusion party of this state in the United States senate, in a public speech in the senate on December 14, 1896, declared that the fusion party in Nebraska would demonstrate that it was not a party of anti-progress, but a party representing great public spirit and enterprise, and,</p>
<p>Whereas, We believe that the Trans-Mississippi exposition to be held in our proud metropolis, the great central gateway tot he west, where the world can behold all the products, industries and civilization of the states west of the Mississippi river, would be of great value, not only to the Trans-Mississippi states in general, but would be of incalculable value to the great state of Nebraska in particular, and</p>
<p>Whereas, These assurances of the governor, the senior United States senator of this state, and their political associates have failed to materialize up to this time, and</p>
<p>Whereas, Instead of acting promptly in a business-like manner and passing the appropriation bill now before this legislature within the first two weeks of this session, the whole matter has been bandied from one house caucus to another, and thereby held in abeyance, and other states whose legislatures are now in session and will soon adjourn, are seriously doubting whether Nebraska intends to make any appropriations for said exposition, and</p>
<p>Whereas, We believe further delay means defeat to the success of said exposition, is disappointing to the national government, humiliating to the people of Nebraska generally and disastrous in the extreme in its effect upon the action of our sister states, therefore, be it</p>
<p>Resolved, As the sense of this body that house roll No. 33, which is the exposition bill, should be taken up and considered at once in the house by the committee of the whole, and disposed of promptly in that broad-minded, business-like and public-spirited manner which the public, both in and out of this state, have a right to expect of this legislature.</p>
<p>Manifestly this is an attempt on the part of republican leaders to unload all the blame for the delay of the exposition bill upon the populists. It is true that a number of populists have aided in preventing speedy action on this measure, but it is also true that the organized effort in which these populists, some knowingly and others innocently, co-operated, was devised and planned by republican leaders in the house. Had it not been for determined opposition of certain republicans in the house on Tuesday the exposition bill would have been taken up on Wednesday. There are the facts, and while from a partisan standpoint Senator Murphy may be justified in attempting to lay the blame upon the populists, the public ought to know exactly where the blame belongs.</p>
<p>World-Herald believes it is now warranted in saying that if the republicans of the house or any considerable number of them will shake themselves loose from would-be leaders who are endeavoring to destroy this bill and would go to its support that a liberal appropriation would be insured. It is true that if the exposition is injured by the failure of the legislature to act promptly that the majority party in the legislature would be held largely responsible. But the republicans who have contributed to the fight against this measure could not escape responsibility until the republicans go to the support of the exposition in a businesslike way they are debarred from passing any criticism upon the populists for failure to act.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact the great majority of republican members of the house are favorable to the measure, but they have so far allowed themselves to be held in check by a few republicans who are desirous of delaying the bill until beyond the danger line.</p>
<p>Senator Murphy is a sincere friend of the exposition, but he ought to have introduced his resolution in a republican caucus rather than in the senate, and instead of criticising the populists he should have criticized Jenkins of Jefferson and those members of the Lancaster delegation who have aided the gentleman from Jefferson in preventing action upon the measure.</p>
<p>The time for child's play is at an end. The people of this state by an overwhelming majority favor a liberal appropriation and yet certain republicans and certain populists who have combined to delay this measure have by their actions carried their opposition to the point where they have even endangered the federal appropriation. The World-Herald desires to remind the members of the legislature who are responsible for this condition that they are assuming for themselves and their respective political organization an awful responsibility. The burden of that responsibility cannot be escaped by the men in the party upon whom that burden ought to rest.</p>
<p>Members of the legislature, without regard to political prejudice, ought to unite to push this measure through, and there ought to be no more needless delay.</p>
<p>The World-Herald, in behalf of the people who pay the taxes in Nebraska, urges the populists to break away from Wooster, and the republicans to abandon Jenkins, and all unite in standing up for Nebraska and one of the greatest expositions that has ever been held upon American soil.</p></div2>

<p>The meeting at which these women were elected was held in the Creighton theater yesterday afternoon and long before the hour announced for the meeting the women of Omaha, by one common impulse, wended their way to the place of meeting in little groups of three or four. When they arrived there they at once became imbued with the spirit of politics and they began peddling tickets and electioneering for their favorite candidates with as much ardor as though they had been in training in political logrolling for years. The theater presented the appearance of an active political convention and the women were rushing to and fro, buttonholing one another and soliciting votes with as much animation and earnestness as though the fate of the nation depended on the result of the meeting. One or two men who were rash enough to venture inside the sacred precincts of the theater were brushed to one side and ignored as completely as though they had not been in existence.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">SOME OF THE TICKETS.</head>
<p>There were six printed tickets in the field, and it was evident in the beginning that a hot fight was to be waged. One of these tickets was prepared by the members of the Woman's club, who have been freely alluded to as "the ring" by those in and out of the club who have been opposed to ring rule and put-up jobs. This ticket was designated by its advocates and makers as "the authorized ticket" and great stress was laid upon that designation. This ticket contained the names of twenty-two women, among them being the four school teachers selected in the mass meeting of public school teachers held in the city hall a few days ago.</p>
<p>Another ticket contained twenty-two names and was issued by the element in the Woman's club which opposes "the ring" and its methods. Another ticket bore the heading "Representative Woman's Ticket" and contained the names of eleven of the representative women of Omaha, the list being headed with the name of Mrs. Charles F. Manderson. Another ticket had the heading "Woman's Club Ticket," but the president of the Woman's club, Mrs. W. P. Harford, authorized the statement that no ticket had been "authorized by the Woman's club." A fifth ticket was headed "Teachers' Ticket" and contained the names of eleven women, four of them being the school teachers referred to heretofore. The sixth ticket contained the names of the four school teachers and no others. This last ticket was not in general circulation, but was in the possession of every school teacher in the meeting, about 300 of them, and they voted it "straight," thereby forcing their candidates far ahead of all the others. This is an old political trick and is often practiced for the purpose of advancing the interests of a particular candidate, but the other women in the meeting were not prepared for it. The result of this piece of political engineering was to elect every teacher who was nominated in the teachers' meeting.</p>
<p>When the meeting was called to order every seat in the lower part of the house was filled, as well as the first two tiers of boxes, and there were several hundred women in the balcony, a careful estimate placing the number in attendance at 1,100. Every woman had a pencil in her hand, and many had provided themselves with blank paper. A few had prepared their tickets before coming to the meeting, but most of them contented themselves with studying the printed tickets and trying to determine which of them to vote.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WHAT SOME OF THEM EXPECTED.</head>
<p>Those who had not received a "tip" witnessed the opening of the meeting with a feeling of pride and pleasant anticipations of the shining example this great mass meeting of women would afford to the horrid men in the way of running a convention without manipulation or having the whole thing "cut and dried" beforehand. Their dream was dispelled very early in the proceeding, however, and the large majority of the women simply sat helpless and with bated breath as they saw the whole convention being run by a few people in a manner which would have excited the admiration and astonishment of the late lamented Mr. Tweed, better known as "Boss" Tweed.</p>
<p>It was evident to the most casual observer, before the meeting had been in operation five minutes, that the "machine" was in full operation and had been well oiled in anticipation of the work which would be required of it. It moved with scarcely a jar and the woman who had the termity to raise a voice in protest was squelched with a celerity which took her breath and prevented a repetition of the offense.</p>
<p>The meeting moved with the utmost smoothness and while the minority had the machinery of the meeting in its hands it was evident after the votes had been counted that the women who were opposing the ring had the votes.</p>
<p>Of the twenty-two names on the ticket prepared by the element which controlled the machinery of the meeting, ten were elected, but four of these were the four school teachers who were forced on the "ring" by the action of the teachers themselves, and one of those elected was a woman whom the members of "the combine" and their friends were secretly knifing, so that of the eleven women for whom the machine members were voting but five were elected.</p>
<p>Of the eleven women elected, the following five are members of the Woman's club: Mrs. Keysor, Mrs. Harford, Mrs. Whittenden, Mrs. Towne, Miss McHugh. Of these Mrs. Chittenden and Miss McHugh were nominated by the school teachers.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">PROCEEDED TO ORGANIZE.</head>
<p>The meeting was called to order by President Wattles of the Exposition association, who referred briefly to the occasion of the meeting and asked the further pleasure of the convention.</p>
<p>A woman in the parquette moved that the meeting proceed to elect a chairman. This was something of a surprise to those who had anticipated that Mr. Wattles would preside in order that the meeting might be steered clear of any parliamentary tangles, but the motion was put and carried before any one had time to draw a second breath and nominations were called for.</p>
<p>Mrs. Z. T. Lindsey was nominated by a woman in the parquette and another woman on the opposite side of the parquette nominated Miss Mary Fairbrother.</p>
<p>"In order to save time we will take a viva voce vote," said Chairman Wattles. "All those in favor of Mrs. Lindsey say aye, all opposed say no; Mrs. Lindsey is declared ejected."</p>
<p>This was a little two swift for the women to grasp, so none of them said anything, but the way they looked around to see what had struck them was an indication of the effect of this drastic dose. </p>
<p>Mrs. Lindsey made her way to the stage from the wings and announced that the next thing in order would be the election of a secretary and called for nominations.</p>
<p>A woman in the parquette nominated Mrs. Draper Smith and, as before, a woman on the opposite side arose and nominated Miss Mary Fairbrother.</p>
<p>"All in favor of Mrs. Smith being the secretary say aye, all opposed say no," said Mrs. Lindsey; the ayes seem to have it, Mrs. Smith is elected."</p>
<p>The women were watching this time and a woman in the parquette arose timidly and said, "Madam president, don't you think it would be a good idea to let us vote on the other nominee?"</p>
<p>It was evident that this was not in accordance with the program as arranged for the meeting, but in order to accommodate any request, however unreasonable, the chairman put the nomination of Miss Fairbrother. There were a number hearty ayes and several feeble noes, and the chair ruled that Mrs. Smith had been elected.</p>
<p>The chair then announced that President Wattles would address the meeting and he was given the floor.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">ANNOUNCES THE OBJECT.</head>
<p>Mr. Wattles opened by stating that he had stood before a cage of untamed lions and had not been rendered speechless, but he said his heart sank within him when notified that he would be expected to address the meeting of women. In order to avoid the awful consequences of stage fright he said he had written out what he had to say, and thereupon drew from his pocket a short written address, which he proceeded to read.</p>
<p>He urged the hearty and equal co-operation in the exposition by both the men and the women of the transmississippi region, and dwelt upon the advantages of the exposition to this section. He complimented the women upon the fact that they did not desire a separate building for women, but preferred to take an equal part with the men, and he closed with a high tribute to the ability of the women of the west.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the address of President Wattles, Mrs. Lindsey requested the secretary to read the plan which had been adopted for woman's work in connection with the exposition.</p>
<p>When this had been done Chairman Lindsey announced that the work of taking an informal ballot for candidates as members of the Board of Lady Managers would be taken up at once. She said that all nominations of women to be voted for on the informal ballot must be made by sending to the secretary the names of such nominees, and she made the further announcement, in the same connection, that "no name will be considered unless the person two whom that name belongs has authorized the use of her name as a candidate." Continuing, the chairman said that the name of Mrs. C. F. Manderson appeared on one of the printed tickets, but she said she had been repeatedly told by Mrs. Manderson that she would not be a candidate.</p>
<p>The chair then appointed the following women to collect the nominations: Mesdames Misener, Bruce and Love and Misses Baird, Scott and Bache.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">LIST OF THE CANDIDATES.</head>
<p>The following names were sent to the secretary: Mesdames T. L. Kimball, James H. McIntosh, W. W. Keysor, E. A. Cudahy, N. P. Fell, W. B. Millard, A. N. Ferguson, H. W. Yates, T. K. Sudborough, W. P. Harford, John Gordon, Orietta Shields Chittenden, William Fleming, J. W. Van Nostrand, S. R. Towne, Emma A. Holyoke, Dr. Gertrude Cuscaden, W. S. Strawn, C. F. Manderson, Mary Girard Andrews, G. M. Hitchcock, C. C. Belden, Clark Woodman, J. N. Cornish, Frank Pugh, Fannie B. Patrick, Clara S. Rosewater, F. L. Haller, J. S. Briggs, H. S. Jaynes, Alvin Saunders, John A. McShane, T. F. Godfrey, Euclid Martin, F. F. Ford, Alexander Pollack, Mary Stiger, Lyle J. Caldwell, R. A. Willis, J. A. Gillespie, Samuel Rees, J. A. Wakefield; Misses Anna Foos, Kate McHugh, Alice Hitte, Dr. F. M. Lankton, Margaret McCarthy and Elizabeth Shirley. These candidates numbered forty-nine.</p>
<p>When these were announced the names of the following women were withdrawn, either by the owners of the names or by some who said that they had been authorized to announce that those named would decline to be candidates: Mrs. Belden, Mrs. Wakefield, Mrs. Manderson, Mrs. Hitchcock, Mrs. Ford, Miss McCarthy and Miss Shirley. This left forty-two candidates before the meeting.</p>
<p>After these names had been announced several attempts were made to name other candidates from the floor, but the chairman refused to allow this to be done, saying it was not in accordance with the rules laid down for the meeting.</p>
<p>A motion was made by Miss Mae Wood, the woman attorney of Omaha, to the effect that upon the first ballot the eleven women receiving the highest vote, providing it should be a majority of the votes cast, should be declared formally elected.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lindsey ruled the motion out of order for the reason that it was contrary to the plan of the meeting laid down by the executive committee.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">HAD NO OPTION.</head>
<p>"I thought the women of Omaha were running this meeting," exclaimed Miss Wood.</p>
<p>"We are obliged to follow the plan laid down by the executive committee of the exposition," replied Mrs. Lindsey, "and we have no option in the matter, as we are working under their direction."</p>
<p>The chairman then announced the following tellers to collect and count the ballots: Mesdames Nattinger, Hoobler, Misener, Wilhelm, Metcalf, Bruce, Johannis, Pennock, Bache, Garrett, Belden, Emerson, Love, Squires, Creigh, Perfect, Rouder; Misses Hamilton, Baird, MacCheane, La Rue, Fairbrother and McCarthy.</p>
<p>The chairman then announced the method of voting to be followed. The women were instructed that any of the printed tickets might be used and any names appearing on those which were objectionable might be scratched out with a pencil and other names written on the ticket. It was also announced that a cross must be marked opposite each name desired to be voted for.</p>
<p>The chairman was called on several times to explain the method of voting and considerable confusion seemed to exist in the minds of many of the women on account of the apparent complications arising from this method.</p>
<p>The tellers then passed among the crowd with wicker baskets and collected the ballots after which they retired to an adjoining room to count the vote.</p></div3>

<pb n="76" xml:id="TMISB02-076"/> 

<div3>
<head type="sub">WHILE THE BALLOTS WERE COUNTED.</head>
<p>The chairman announced that pending the report of the tellers the meeting would be entertained for a time, and a substitute was sent to the ante-room to relieve Miss McCarthy, who addressed the meeting on "One Day in the School Room." Mrs. Harriet Heller followed Miss McCarthy in a short talk on women's work in connection with the exposition. Miss Ella Day, the elocutionist, was called to the platform and entertained the meeting for some time with recitations. Dr. Freda M. Lankton spoke briefly on women's work in the exposition, making a plea that the work of both men and women be judged by the same standard.</p>
<p>Mrs. Keysor and Mrs. Briggs were called for, but the chair said it would be unwise to allow candidates to have the freedom of the floor.</p>
<p>Mrs. Roudebush was then called for and spoke entertainingly of the experience of a western woman (herself) amid the women of the effete east.</p>
<p>At it was then nearly 6 o'clock, and a large number of the women had left the meeting, a vote was taken to determine whether those remaining should await the report of the tellers and take the second ballot, or adjourn until another day. The sentiment was in favor of remaining until the result of the vote was announced and then taking another ballot and thereby completing the electing of the eleven members of the woman's board.</p>
<p>The meeting then resolved itself into a sewing circle and the women gossiped with one another until the counting board made its report.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">TELLERS READY TO REPORT.</head>
<p>Shortly after 6 o'clock the announcement was made that the tellers were ready to report and the meeting was called to order to listen to the report as read by Miss Rene Hamilton. She announced that the following twenty-two women had received the highest vote and had been selected as candidates: Miss Foos, Mrs. Keyser, Miss McHugh, Mrs. Harford, Miss Hitte, Mrs. Cudahy, Mrs. Crittenden, Mrs. McIntosh, Mrs. Towne, Mrs. Kimball, Mrs. Feil, Mrs. Martin, Mrs. Sudborough, Mrs. Haller, Mrs. Woodman, Mrs. Ferguson, Mrs. Millard, Mrs. Yates, Mrs. Gillespie, Mrs. Briggs, Mrs. Fleming, Miss Boyd.</p>
<p>The chairman then announced that a second ballot would then be taken for the eleven women who were to be elected as members of the board. She instructed each woman to vote for eleven of the twenty-two who had been named as candidates by the report of the canvassing board and to deposit their ballots in tin boxes stationed at the front doors for that purpose. There were about 500 women in the house at the time this announcement was made, the great majority of those who had been present during the first ballot having gone away under the impression that but one ballot was to be taken at that meeting. Of those who remained many were confused by the many printed tickets before them, and the lack of opportunity to designate those who had been elected on the first ballot. As a result many voted for women who had not been elected on the first ballot, thereby throwing away their votes on those who were not candidates.</p>
<p>The ballots were taken in charge by the tellers and were taken to Creighton hall, where the tellers assembled in the evening to count the vote.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">THEY COUNT VOTES RAPIDLY.</head>
<p>When the board of tellers retired to count the vote the members were divided into groups, forming eight boards, which proceeded to count the vote in the most expeditious manner. Each of these boards was given a bunch of tickets and a large tally sheet on which were arranged the names of the candidates. The votes were read to the one having the tally sheet and there tallied. When the tickets were counted the tally sheets were footed and the total taken of all the sheets.</p>
<p>No attempt was made to count the whole number of ballots so that it was impossible to tell how many votes were cast.</p>
<p>Some of the groups of tellers counted every name that appeared on the tickets, while others made no record whatever of those names which were "unauthorized," that is, those which had not been announced as having the full sanction of their owners for use as candidates. Among these was Mrs. Manderson, for whom a number of votes were cast, also Mrs. Hitchcock, Mrs. Ford and others. In computing the total vote it was therefore impossible to learn how many votes had been cast for any of these women. Votes were also cast for at least four other women who had not been nominated at all, and these were not counted by the canvassing board. These women were Mrs. Misener, Ms. Heller, Miss LaRue and Miss Fairbrother.</p>

<p>The following is the complete list of the vote as compiled by the canvassing board:</p>

<p>The first twenty-two names on this list were duly announced to the meeting as the candidates for election on the second ballot and after the second ballot had been taken, as detailed elsewhere, the canvassing board assembled in Creighton hall and proceeded to canvass the second vote.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">SELECTING THE WINNERS.</head>
<p>This work was performed in the same expeditious manner which characterized the counting of the first ballot, the women displaying highly creditable skill in counting votes. The first vote, at which fully 1,000 votes were cast, each vote being for from four to eleven candidates, was counted by the board in about two hours. The second vote, at which about 600 votes were cast, was counted in about an hour and a half.</p>
<p>The result of the count of the second ballot was as follows:</p>

    <row><cell>Miss. Foos</cell><cell>531</cell><cell>Mrs. Feil</cell><cell>206</cell></row>

<p>These were the "regular nominees," having been nominated as candidates on the first ballot. In addition the following women  received votes: Mrs. Gordon, 2; Mrs. Stiger, 2; Mrs. Tilden, 3; Mrs. Manderson, 2: Mrs. Caldwell, 2; Mrs. Strawn, 4; Dr. Cuscaden, 4; Mrs. Holyoke, 2; Mrs. Rosewater, 2; Mrs. Andrews, 1; Miss McCheane, 3; Mrs. Van Nostrand, 1. The first eleven women in the above list were declared duly elected.</p></div3></div2>

<head type="sub">Will Work Up the Exposition.</head>
<p>A committee representing the exposition has arranged to leave here Sunday night for a short trip, in which it will visit the legislatures in several states and advocate the interests of the exposition. It will go first to Topeka, where it will be on Monday. It will go to Denver, where arrangements have been made for a joint session of the two houses of the state legislature to accommodate the committee on Tuesday. It will then go to Cheyenne for Wednesday and to Salt Lake for Thursday. It has not been definitely settled who will form the party going, but President Wattles, G. M. Hitchcock, John L. Webster and Clement Chase will be part of it.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="main">BILL MAY PASS THIS WEEK</head>
<head type="sub">Appropriation for the Exposition is Nearer Accomplishment Than Ever.</head>
<head type="sub">ITS FRIENDS HAVE TIRED OF THE DELAY</head>
<head type="sub">Partisan Schemes Intended to Give Advantage Through the Measure Will Be Pushed Aside for Action.</head>
    <div3>
<p>LINCOLN, Feb. 12.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The friends of the Transmississippi Exposition propose to make a determined effort during the ensuing legislative week to bring the bill appropriating $150,000 for the aid of the enterprise before the legislature for final action, one way or the other. There has been but one reason why the measure has not been acted upon, and that one reason is compressed within the word "politics." The assertion has been made and reiterated that the fusion majority in the house is strong enough to pass the bill, but that the republicans have delayed action. The unreasonableness of this assumption seems to be apparent when it is remembered there are in the house of representatives seventy-two fusionists and but twenty-eight republicans. The ability of the majority to take up the measure should be unquestioned. Of course, it must be admitted that not all of the members of the majority party are favorable to the bill; on the other hand, it is not denied that those of the majority who are unwilling to vote an appropriation are ready at any time to accept the responsibility of their votes. There are many republicans ready to vote for the measure when they are given an opportunity. The favorable result of a vote is not doubted by any friends of the exposition. The republican minority in the house keenly resents the imputation that it has delayed action upon the bill. It is true, several republican members are favoring a policy of delay, but the larger proportion of the republican members are ready and anxious to vote for the bill.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">BUSY PLAYING POLITICS.</head>
<p>It is well established here that a faction of the majority has been engaged in a game of politics every day since the opening of the session. The program of this faction has been clear from the beginning. The leading features of that program have been the unseating of the four republicans from Douglas county, the recount of the ballots cast for the constitutional amendments, and the repeal of the beet sugar bounty law. The program has been outlined and presented by the very men who should have the exposition most at heart. The feeling is growing that distinctive party measures should be left to party men, and that the men who have been designated to push the exposition enterprise should confine their efforts to that project alone.</p>
<p>It cannot be successfully refuted that the leaders of the majority have determined to make the exposition a party measure. The whole policy of delay has been pursued in the vain hope that by some means the republican minority can be crowded into a position where it will oppose the exposition as a party question. Then the majority leaders hope to rush the exposition bill through the house and the senate and to the governor so as to be able to point to the appropriation as one of the things for which Omaha should be grateful to the free silver party. The republicans comprising the minority will not be caught in a trap so skillfully conceived, but so carelessly executed. Most of them, if not all of them, will vote for the exposition bill. They are ready to vote at any time.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">MAY BRING ALL HANDS TOGETHER.</head>
<p>The feeling is rapidly growing in legislative circles that the time for action has come and that the attempts of the free silver leaders to force the republicans to vote against the exposition enterprise should cease. The exposition means everything for Nebraska. The triumph of a single faction means nothing for the state. Prompt action seems to be imperative in order to prevent unfavorable action in other states, and many members of the legislature believe that the time has come when such action should be taken without regard to party triumph. If the exposition bill passes it must pass as the will of a majority of the members of the legislature without a resort to party distinction.</p>
<p>There is a movement on foot, participated in by members of each house, to bring about a joint caucus of the majority element in behalf of the exposition. Friends of the bill among the populists declare that the time has come for action, that the credit of the state is suffering from delay and that if it depends on the populists to pass the bill they cannot act too quickly. The caucus will likely be arranged for on a night early next week.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">BRINGS IN COUNTY BOARDS.</head>
<p>Senator William D. Schaal of Sarpy county has prepared and will introduce early next week a bill looking toward the co-operation of county agricultural societies in the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. The bill as drawn does not include the State fair, but it is the intention to do so. A similar bill will also be introduced in the house. Following is the full text of the measure:</p>
<p>A bill for an act to permit county agricultural societies to participate in the transmississippi congress and to provide for expenses of county exhibits.</p>
<p>Whereas, The Transmississippi Exposition, to be held in Omaha, Neb., during the year 1898 is an event of supreme importance in the history of the state, and</p>
<p>Whereas, A just feeling of state pride impels the agricultural societies to co-operate with the directors of the exposition, that the resources and advantages of our commonwealth may be better understood by the thousands who attend: </p>
<p>Therefore, Be it enacted by the legislature of the state of Nebraska:</p>
<p>Section 1. That any county agricultural society of the state upon a majority vote of the directors thereof, is hereby authorized to appropriate the funds to which it would be entitled for the year 1898, as provided for in section 12, chapter 11, article 1 of the Compiled Statues of 1895, for the purpose of securing and maintaining a suitable exhibit of the manufactured and agricultural products of said county at the Transmississippi Exposition, to be held in Omaha, Neb., during the year 1898.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. It shall be the duty of said board of directors of any agricultural society entitled to act under the provisions of this act to secure and maintain county exhibits for the exposition, which exhibits shall be in lieu of the "annual fair," required of county agricultural societies in section 12, chapter 11, article 1 of the Compiled Statutes of 1895. Provided, that the said board of directors shall publish at the first annual meeting thereafter of said society a full and complete statement of all expenditures connected with said exhibit and to turn into the treasury for the benefit of said society and funds remaining unappropriated.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage, approval and publication, according to law.</p></div3></div2>

Grim visaged war will not know itself after the women get together at the Y.M.C.A. and the imps of discord will scatter in afright at the outcome of their work. The affair will be enjoyable strictly so for the newspaper men, and Monday's TRIBUNE will tell you all about it. Like the professional politicians none of the candidates have died or resigned since yesterday's issue of the TRIBUNE. Some may take to their beds with a sick headache or two after the tournament, but they will not mind such things during the fray. It is life or death with some of them so they think, and there will be no "dearie, dearie" business in their campaigning. If you hear the climax of an earthquake this afternoon just pass it up as the final clasp of the opposing Amazons.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">EVENTS IN COUNCIL BLUFFS</head>
<head type="sub">Two Members of the Exposition Board of Lady Managers Are Selected.</head>
<head type="sub">Mrs. Edith M. E. Reed and Mrs. Sarah C. Key Chosen From Many Names Presented.</head>
<head type="sub">Both Are Eminently Qualified for the Work Set Before Them&#8212;-Round of Social Events&#8212;-Gossip.</head>
<p>A mass meeting of women was held yesterday forenoon in the Roval Arcanum hall in the Beno block for the election of two Council Bluffs members of the board of lady managers of the Trans-Mississippi exposition. The attendance included about fifty ladies, of whom a large majority were members of the various women's clubs of the city. The chief interest in the enterprise, in fact, seemed to be among the women's clubs, and members of at least half a dozen different clubs were present, each club having its candidates for the honor of election.</p>
<p>The gathering was called to order by Mr. Lucius Wells, the Council Bluffs member of the board of directors, who explained briefly the nature, origin and object of the movement for the holding of a Trans-Mississippi exposition and how the work of preparation is being conducted.</p>
<p>On motion of Mrs. A. W. Casady Mrs. Joseph R. Reed was unanimously elected chairman and Mrs. O. W. Wirt was chosen secretary.</p>
<p>On motion of Miss Clara Evans it was resolved that nominations should be made by informal ballot, and the chair announced that the persons receiving the four highest number of ballots on the informal ballot would be voted for on the formal ballot.</p>
<p>The result of the informal ballot was as follows: Mrs. Edith M. E. Reed, 35; Mrs. Sarah C. Key, 9; Mrs. James McCabe, 9; Mrs. George C. Phelps, 7; Mrs. Horace Everett, 6; Mrs. Thomas Metcalf, 4; Miss Carrie Dodge, 2; Mrs. W. O. Wirt, 2; Miss Clara Evans, 2; Mrs. P. J. Montgomery, 1; Mrs. A. W. Casady, 1; Mrs. J. E. Harkness, 1; Mrs. F. S. Thomas, 1; Dr. Sarah Smith, 1; Miss Peterson, 1.</p>
<p>The formal ballot resulted: Mrs. Edith M. E. Reed, 41; Mrs. Sarah C. Key, 20; Mrs. James McCabe, 18; Mrs. George C. Phelps, 5.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed and Mrs. Key were declared elected, and on motion the election was made unanimous. The latter was not present, but Mrs. Reed expressed her thanks for the honor in a brief but graceful little speech.</p>
<p>Both the ladies elected to represent Council Bluffs on the board of lady managers are unusually well qualified for the work. Mrs. Reed was formerly, before her marriage to Judge Reed, the cashier and general manager of a bank in which she was a heavy stockholder, and Mrs. Key has been prominently identified with the club work of the women of this city.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">EXPOSITION BUILDINGS.</head>
<head type="sub">Important Business Transacted by Executive Committee.</head>
<p>At the meeting of the executive committee of the Trans-Mississippi exposition directory yesterday afternoon the dim outlines of the physical aspects of the big show began to appear.</p>
<p>It was decided that there should be buildings as follows:</p>

<lg>
<l>Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry.</l>
<l>Mines and Mining.</l>
<l>Manufactures and Liberal Arts.</l>
<l>Fine Arts.</l>
<l>Electricity and Machinery.</l>
<l>Auditorium.</l>
<l>Nebraska Building.</l>
<l>Grand Army of the Republic.</l>
<l>Silver Palace.</l></lg>

<p>It is understood that this plan may be changed if necessary.</p>
<p>There was some informal discussion as to the general plans of the grounds, but no action will be taken in this respect until architects are appointed and conferred with. Mr. Reed suggested that the exhibition buildings be arranged in the form of a circle and that the plaisance buildings form a circle around it with a board avenue between.</p>
<p>Manager Kirkendall of the buildings and ground department announced that he had appointed Dion Geraldine of Chicago superintendent of construction. It is expected that he will be here tomorrow and begin work at once.</p>
<p>The first delegation to visit the state legislatures will leave tonight for Kansas. Its itinerary has been published. The party will comprise G. W. Wattles, G. M. Hitchcock, John L. Webster, W. S. Poppleton, Clement Chase and H. E. Palmer.</p>
<p>They will travel in the Pullman "Silver City."</p>
<p>Among those who have been mentioned for the secretaryship of the board of lady managers is Mrs. Julia Crissey Hoobler.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">Wyoming Lawmakers Interested.</head>
<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
<p>Cheyenne, Wyo., Feb. 13.&#8212;In the Wyoming legislature today a joint committee of both houses was appointed to make arrangements for the suitable reception on Wednesday next of the committee from the Trans-Mississippi exposition managers who are to visit the Wyoming legislature.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">FOLLOW UP AN ADVANTAGE.</head>
<p>At Erfling hall last evening the North End Improvement club held its first meeting since the location of the exposition at Miller park. The club was jubilant, and resolved to follow up the advantage thus gained by going after the city council and board of county commissioners for increased appropriations for good roads and streets and other municipal improvements in keeping with the needs of the exposition surroundings. Captain Reynolds of Florence, Charles Y. Craig and G. F. Franklin were elected a committee to labor with the county commissioners and another committee, with Councilman Dave Christie as chairman, was elected to draft resolutions setting forth the needs of the north end.</p>
<p>The club will hold a big rally the coming Thursday evening at Erfling hall, at which time the resolutions will be presented for discussion and the local situation will be thoroughly overhauled. It is proposed to send a committee to Lincoln to lobby for the exposition appropriation if there isn't something favorable done in the meantime.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">PROMPT AND LIBERAL ACTION.</head>
<p>Washington, D. C., Feb. 13.&#8212;Omaha World-Herald, Omaha, Neb.: Prompt and liberal legislative action in aid of the exposition in Nebraska is highly essential to stimulate congressional aid. I fear much damage will result to the enterprise in congress and in the several state legislatures from the growing impression that the legislature and people of our own state are indifferent to its success.

    <head type="main">EXPOSITION IS MOVING</head>
<head type="sub">Directors of the Transmississippi and International See Light Ahead.</head>
<head type="sub">ARE PLANNING FOR THE MATERIAL WORK</head>
<head type="sub">Decide Upon the Nine Main Buildings for the Grounds.</head>
<head type="sub">GRAND SILVER PALACE TO BE A FEATURE.</head>
<head type="sub">G. A. R. Structure Designed for the Display of War Souvenirs.</head>
<head type="sub">STATE LEGISLATURES TO BE VISITED</head>
<head type="sub">Dion Geraldine of Chicago Engaged as Superintendent of Construction, and Will Arrive Tomorrow to Begin Work.</head>
<div3>
<p>The directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition held their regular weekly meeting yesterday under auspices more favorable to the success of the vast enterprise than at any time since the matter was first broached. They saw their way clear at least to take definite steps toward the building of the city which is to exist for six months in the northern part of Omaha, and have within its limits displays of the resources and development of most of the twenty-four transmississippi states, and possibly of a few states not so classed.</p>
<p>The directors decided upon the nature and number of the main buildings to be erected. There are to be nine of them. They are in general to be such buildings as were at the World's fair, except that they will be more compact. Two or three departments will be managed under one roof. Two new departures in exposition buildings have been decided upon. One of these is a building for a Grand Army of the Republic display, in which souvenirs of the nation's wars will be exhibited. The other is a Silver Palace, in recognition of the marvelous wealth of the mountain states, and a description of which was published in the exposition number of The Bee a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Apropos to this decision by the directors came the acceptance by Dion Geraldine of Chicago of the position of superintendent of construction, a position similar to the one he held at the World's fair. He will arrive tomorrow and enter at once upon his duties.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">PROSPECT OF STATE PARTICIPATION.</head>
<p>The outlook for a generous appropriation by the state legislature has materially improved during the past few days, prominent members of the dominant party in the legislature assuring the managers of the exposition that the bill is none the less sure because of having been delayed in its passage.</p>
<p>Senator William D. Schaal of Sarpy county, a populist, has introduced a bill providing that agricultural societies in the state may take the aid they receive from the tax levy created for that purpose, and use it in making a display for their counties at the exposition.</p>
<p>Three different parties of friends of the exposition will visit the legislatures in the transmississippi states and advocate a suitable appropriation for a creditable display from those states. One of these parties will leave tonight for the west; one will leave tomorrow for the north; and later another will leave for the south.</p>
<p>The women of South Omaha and Council Bluffs have followed the action of their sisters in this city, and have held enthusiastic mars meetings, in which they have elected two members of the Board of Lady Managers for each city. Mrs. A. B. Towl and Mrs. A. A. Munro were chosen from South Omaha, and Mrs. J. R. Reed and Mrs. S. C. Key for Council Bluffs.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">DECIDE ON THE MAIN BUILDINGS.</head>
<head type="sub">Exposition Directors Plan for Nine Main Structures as a Starter.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The general appearance of the grounds of the Transmississippi Exposition is beginning to assume tangible form, and already the dim outlines of the main buildings which will form the central portion of the great fair are becoming visible. The number and names of the principal buildings to be erected on the grounds were determined at the regular weekly meeting of the executive committee of the exposition, held yesterday afternoon at the Commercial club rooms.</p>
<p>The committee, after a full discussion of the matter, passed as resolution providing for the following nine buildings, which will constitute the nucleus around which the minor buildings will be assembled: Building No. 1, Agriculture, horticulture and Forestry; No. 2, Mines and Mining; No. 3, Manufactures and Liberal Arts; No. 4, Fine Arts; No. 5, Electricity and Machinery; No. 6, Auditorium; No. 7, The Nebraska Building; No. 8, Grand Army of the Republic Building; No. 9, The Silver Palace.</p>
<p>In the discussion regarding these buildings the idea was advanced that the Auditorium building should be made a model of the world-famed temple in Salt Lake City, a building renowned as having the most perfect acoustic properties of any auditorium in the world. This idea met with great favor with all the members of the committee present, and it was tacitly conceded that no better plan could be followed.</p>
<p>Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds announced that he had secured the services of Dion Geraldine as general superintendent of construction of the exposition buildings and grounds. He recommended his appointment and the committee endorsed the appointment. Mrs. Geraldine occupied a similar position in connection with the World's fair and was highly recommended to Mr. Kirkendall by the highest officers of the Columbian exposition. Mr. Geraldine will arrive in Omaha tomorrow and will enter at once upon his duties in connection with the work of the Department of Buildings and Grounds.</p>
<p>A rule was adopted by which all the regular employes of the exposition will receive their pay on the first day of each month, commencing with the 1st of March.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WILL VISIT LEGISLATURES.</head>
<p>A party of directors will start west tonight to visit the state capitals and appearing before the legislatures to urge the passage of bills making appropriations for state exhibits at the exposition. The party will be headed by President Wattles and will comprise the following: G. W. Wattles, G. M. Hitchcock, J. L. Webster, W. S. Poppleton, Clement Chase, H. E. Palmer. The party will visit Topeka, Denver, Cheyenne, Salt Lake City and other points, the route beyond Salt Lake not having been definitely decided upon.</p>
<p>Another party of directors will start on a similar tour of the states to the north, leaving Omaha early this week. This party will visit St. Paul, Minneapolis and Duluth, Minn.; Pierre, S. D. and possibly Bismarck, N. D. This party will be under the leadership of Chairman Lindsey of the executive committee, but the exact composition of the party has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Preparations are being made to send a third party to the southern states as soon as arrangements can be made. The route of this party has not been decided, but it will probably cover all of the states to the south.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">SOUTH OMAHA'S LADY MANAGERS.</head>
<head type="sub">Lively Mass Meeting Makes a Choice Out of Nine Candidates.</head>
    <div3>
<p>Mrs. E. B. Towl and Mrs. A. A. Munro were elected as South Omaha's members of the Board of Lady Managers of the Transmississippi Exposition at a mass meeting held yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Long before 2 o'clock the gymnasium of the Young Men's Christian association in South Omaha was filled with women, and fully fifty were unable to find seats when Mrs. M. Carl Smith called the meeting to order and announced that the selection of a permanent chairman was the first business in order. Miss Hettie Moore was nominated for the position and elected, there being no opposition.</p>
<p>Chairman Moore, after thanking the women, stated that the selection of a secretary would come next and Mrs. Carl Smith was nominated by Mrs. John L. Martin and Mrs. John Carroll was nominated by Mrs. Aberly. Mrs. W. S. White obtained the floor and suggested that a secretary be elected by ballot. Mrs. Talbot thought an oral vote would save a great deal of time and it was decided to choose a secretary by an aye and nay vote.</p>
<p>At this point Mrs. Carl Smith announced that she withdrew in favor of Mrs. Carroll, but the women would not allow this. On an aye and nay vote for Mrs. Smith she was declared by the chairman elected secretary, no one having voted against her. Mrs. Carroll was not voted upon at all, although the attention of Chairman Moore was called to the fact.</p>
<p>Secretary Smith then read the call for the meeting issued by J. A. Wakefield, secretary of the exposition directory.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">NAMES THE TELLERS.</head>
<p>The next move was to appoint tellers, and upon motion of Mrs. Talbot ten tellers were appointed, one to be chairman. Chairman Moore appointed tellers as follows: Mesdames Crassy, Martin, Schrie, Montgomery, Redmond, Witten, Pinnell and Misses Evans, Littell and Pollard. Miss Evans was to act as chairman of the tellers and the nine were to be divided up in groups of three to collect the ballots. In announcing the tellers the chairman read the list from a card which she held in her hand, the names having been written in ink before the meeting was called to order. This gave quite a cut-and-dried look to the proceedings, but no protests were made.</p>
<p>The rooms by this time were uncomfortably crowded and women were standing way out on the stairways unable to get into the gymnasium. Mrs. Towl moved that the meeting adjourn to the Methodist church and a vote was taken. The motion to adjourn was lost, but nevertheless the chairman declared it was carried and the march to the church was taken up. The edifice was as cold as a barn, the windows having been open a great part of the day, but this did not appear to dampen the ardor of the women in the least. Every seat in the church was soon filled and it was estimated that fully 500 women were present.</p>
<p>It was decided that nominations should be made by ballot, the eleven having the highest vote being declared candidates. At this juncture Mrs. Aberly was recognized by the chair and she announced herself as a candidate, and added that she had been unable to induce any of the newspapers to print her name in the list of candidates.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">NAMES BROUGHT OUT.</head>
<p>The nominating ballot resulted in the following receiving votes: Mesdames Towl, Munro, White, Geary, Mead, Carroll, Talbot, Smith, Westerfield, Carley, Aberly, Sloane, Ensor, Montgomery, Lane, Holmes, Vail, Haide and the Misses Pollard, Havens, Mullen, O'Teele and Moore. In rapid succession the women arose and withdrew their names until only nine were left to be voted on at the informal ballot.</p>
<p>While the ballots were again being distributed Miss Moore announced that the four having the highest number of votes would be voted upon for directors. The convention then proceeded to ballot on the following names: Mesdames Towl, Munro, Mead, White, Geary, Talbot Westerfield, Lane and Aberly.</p>
<p>During the counting of the ballots Mrs. Lindsey of Omaha was called upon for a few remarks in regard to the exposition and explained in a measure what the women directors would be expected to do and the possibilities for good work in the educational line.</p>
<p>The informal ballot stood: Towl, 279; Munro, 164; Mead, 99; Guary, 64; Talbot, 30; White, 20; Westerfield, 13; Lane, 4; Aberly, 1, the four highest votes alone being read to the convention. A total of 337 votes were cast on this ballot.</p>
<p>Next came the formal ballot, the results being: Towl, 291; Munro, 212; Geary, 64; Mead, 101.</p>
<p>Chairman Moore declared Mrs. Towl and Mrs. Munro elected and the convention adjourned.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">SKETCHES OF THE OMAHA ELEVEN.</head>
<head type="sub">This City's Contribution to the Woman's Board&#8212;Who They Are.</head>
<p>Unusual interest has been attached to the selection of members of the Board of Lady Managers of the exposition. Now that the strife for office has been settled by the women themselves, it may be of interest to know who the successful candidates are. The following are brief sketches of the active members of the board:</p>
<p>Miss Anna Foos is the principal of the Kellom public school, Twenty-second and Paul streets. She has been a resident of this city and a teacher in the public schools for the past fifteen years. She is an active participant in the best educational circles and is the owner of considerable property throughout the city. Her name was one of the first suggested when the school teachers decided to make an effort to elect several of their number to the board of managers. Her popularity is attested by the fact that she received 531 votes out of 600 cast on the final ballot, easily leading all other candidates.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jennie Ellis Keysor taught in the public schools when she first came to Omaha. She was stationed at the eighth grade and then at the High school. English literature has always been a favorite study with her, and she taught it for many years in the public schools here. She studied at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, for several years. Mrs. Keysor has been the vice president and is now the leader of the art section of the Woman's club. She has written and published one or two thoughtful books on literary subjects. She has lectured on art and literature in many cities of Nebraska. She leads a class in English

<pb n="79" xml:id="TMISB02-079"/> 



literature in this city and presides over a beautiful and cultured home. She is a logical and persuasive speaker, and never fails to convince an audience.</p>
<p>Miss Kate McHugh is another representative of the school teachers, being the assistant principal of the High school and instructor in English literature. She has been engaged in pedagogic work in this city for the past ten years. She is prominent in Unity club circles, and a frequent contributor to their meetings. She is a sister of Judge William D. McHugh, and came to this city from Galena, Ill.</p>
<p>Miss Alice Hitte is a representative of the city school teachers on the board. She has been connected with the public school system of Omaha for the past seven years, and is now engaged as the special instructor of drawing, having supervision of all the drawing in the public schools.</p>
<p>Mrs. O. S. Chittenden, while not actively engaged in educational work at present, was until a year ago. She was identified with the kindergarten department of the public school system as Miss Shields, and resigned on account of her marriage a year ago.</p>
<p>Mrs. W. P. Harford has been a resident of Omaha for the past three years. Before coming west she was a resident of Dayton, O. There she was the missionary secretary and general manager of the foreign missionary societies of the denomination known as the United Brethren in Christ. She held this position for thirteen years and during that time did considerable field work for the missionary society in this country. She was also editor-in-chief of the missionary journal, The Woman's Evangel, during the same period. She was educated at Otterbein university, Westerville, O., where she took the degree of master of arts. While acting as missionary secretary she made two foreign trips. The first was in 1888, when she was one of the delegates from the United States to the world's missionary conference in London. During the other trip she spent much time in travel through continental Europe. She had identified herself especially with the work of churches and of temperance and missionary societies.</p>
<p>Mrs. Edward A. Cudahy, the wife of the head of the great packing house firm of South Omaha, came to Omaha from Chicago about five years ago. Besides being a most cultured woman and a liberal entertainer, she is greatly interested in music. Before coming to this city she was prominent in Chicago musical circles. In this city she is well known among musicians as the leading soprano soloist of the choir of St. John's Collegiate (Catholic) church.</p>
<p>Mrs. J. H. McIntosh is the daughter of Captain and Mrs. C. B. Rustin, one of the oldest and most highly respected families in Omaha, her maiden name being Miss Claire Rustin. She is a graduate of Vassar college. Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and for several years after her return home taught in the High school of this city. She has also served two terms on the board of directors of the public library, retiring from the board a year ago. She is a pianist of considerable repute and was a prominent leader of the Ladies' Musical society a few years ago.</p>
<p>Mrs. S. R. Towne is the wife of the assistant city physician. When the Woman's club was first organized she was prominent among those who helped establish it and was its first vice president. Subsequently she was elected president and is now holding the position of vice president again. Three years ago she was one of the two delegates from the Woman's club in this city to the biennial convention of Women's clubs of the United States at Philadelphia. Mrs. Towne has also been prominent in the work of university extension in this city and is especially devoted to the study of the natural sciences. She was born in Vermont and resided there during her youth; after that she lived in the central portions of Massachusetts until 1888, when she removed to Omaha.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thomas L. Kimball is the wife of the president of the Union Depot company. She has resided in this city for years and has always been identified with the most worthy charitable institutions. For several years past she has been the efficient president of the Creche, a home that looks after poor boys and girls of a tender age. While she has proven herself an indefatigable worker for this charity, there have been but few, if any, charitable undertakings in this city with which she has not been intimately associated.</p>
<p>Mrs. Euclid Martin is the wife of Postmaster Martin. On the Board of Lady Managers of the exposition she will be the especial representative of the Nebraska Ceramic club. While prominent in other cultured circles, she always devoted considerable time and attention to china painting and is recognized as a leader in that work. She returned last fall from a year's study and residence abroad.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">BIG BOOM FOR THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">Outside Papers Devote Space to the Big Show.</head>
<p>The press of California and the Pacific coast states is devoting considerable space to the Transmississippi Exposition. The metropolitan dailies of Portland, Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles have commended the enterprise editorially and have published much descriptive matter concerning it. The papers of smaller towns on the coast have been no less liberal. There is every promise of a large appropriation by the California legislature. The San Francisco Chronicle of Sunday, February 7, published a full-page, finely illustrated write-up of the exposition, copy for which was furnished by the press bureau. Pictures of prominent public buildings in Omaha and a view in Hanscom park embellish the article, which is largely made up of a chronicle of what has been done by the promoters of the exposition, a description of Omaha and an epitome of the wealth and resources of the west. It is by far the strongest advertisement of the exposition that has appeared in the western press, which, generally speaking, has shown a spirit of liberality in treating of the enterprise.</p>
<p>The eastern press is becoming aroused to the importance of the project. The Buffalo Illustrated Sunday Express will today contain a full-page write-up of the exposition, with half-tone illustrations upon book-print paper, and will doubtless prove to be the most artistic publication which has to date been made with reference to the exposition. The Chicago Inter Ocean will, Monday morning, contain a page of illustrated matter about the exposition, while the Chicago Sunday Chronicle will today present an exhaustive illustrated article about the big show. Other influential papers of the east and south have also given space to the recent issues of the press bureau.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">NORTH SIDERS PREPARE TO HELP.</head>
<head type="sub">Mass Meeting to Devise Plans to Aid the Exposition.</head>
<p>A meeting of the North Side Improvement club was held last night at Erfling's hall on Sherman avenue to make arrangements for a mass meeting of the residents and property owners of the north side to be held Thursday evening of this week to take steps to assist the directory of the exposition in every way possible in connection with the work about the grounds, and in assisting in securing additional subscriptions to exposition stock.</p>
<p>Steps were taken to secure a large attendance at the meeting and the members of the executive committee of the exposition who are in the city will be invited to be present. A committee, consisting of President Richardson, Secretary Christie and Mr. Shepherd, was appointed to prepare suitable resolutions expressing the sentiments of the people of the north side regarding the exposition and present the resolutions to the meeting Thursday night.</p>
<p>The meeting will be held at Erfling's hall, at Sherman avenue and Corby streets, Thursday evening at 8 o'clock.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="main">TWO WOMEN FOR THE BOARD</head>
<head type="sub">Council Bluffs Ladies Chosen for the Exposition Work.</head>
<head type="sub">ELECTION ENGENDERS MUCH INTEREST</head>
<head type="sub">Not a Great Turnout to the Mass Meeting, but Much Zeal Shown by Those Who Did Go.</head>
<p>There were not as many women present at the meeting in the Royal Arcanum hall yesterday afternoon as were expected, but those present took deep interest in the selection of two Council Bluffs women to represent the city in the Lady Board of Managers of the Transmississippi Exposition. There appeared to be a reluctance on the part of the Council Bluffs women to take up the matter, and the idea seemed to prevail that the women who were to represent Council Bluffs had been previously selected by the management of the big show, and that the meeting yesterday was only for the purpose of ratifying what had previously been done. Those who did attend, however, had no such idea and they went into the fight for their favorites with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Lucius Wells called the meeting to order and stated the object. His speech was brief and to the point and he immediately left the hall after he concluded. Mrs. J. R. Reed, wife of Judge Reed, was called to the chair and Mrs. W. O. Wirt was made secretary. Parliamentary rules were observed up to this point, but the remainder of the proceedings were carried on in sweet indifference to all such restrictions. Miss Cora Evans moved that an informal ballot be taken for nomination of candidates. The presiding officer assented and announced without taking the trouble to put the motion that the four women receiving the largest number of votes on the informal ballot should be considered the candidates and should be voted for at the next formal ballot. This model ruling saved perhaps a lot of wrangling and cut off all the eloquent eulogies that might have been expected in nominating speeches. the chair appointed four tellers to receive and count the secret ballot. They were Mrs. A. W. Casady, Mrs. George Carson, Miss Kingsbury and Miss Clara Evans. The chair announced that the ballots should be written secretly and placed in a hat and when all had voted the hat should be brought forward and deposited on the table, after which the votes should be counted by the four tellers. There was a rustle of perfumed note papers and a general biting of pencils all over the <unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> The informal ballot showed that the<note>column ends abruptly</note></p>
<p>Reed, 35; Mrs. S. C. Key, 9; Mrs. James McCabe, 9; Mrs. Horace Everett, 6; Mrs. Thomas Metcalf, 4; Mrs. George T. Phelps, 5; Mrs. W. O. Wirt, 2; Miss Cora Evans, 2; Mrs. Dr. Thomas, 1; Dr. Sarah Smith, 1; Miss Peterson, 1; Mrs. Montgomery, 1; Mrs. A. W. Casady, 1; Mrs. J. E. Harkness, 1.</p>
<p>It only required one formal ballot to determine which two of the four receiving the largest number of votes were the choice of the meeting. The counting showed that Mrs. Reed had received forty-one votes, Mrs. Key 20, Mrs. McCabe 18 and Mrs. Phelps 5.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed made a pretty little speech, thanking the women for their handsome vote of confidence. The women then arose to leave the hall without the formality of an adjournment, until Mrs. Harkness called attention to the oversight and suggested that the selection of Mrs. Reed and Mrs. Key be made unanimous. A motion to that effect was accordingly put and carried without a dissenting voice. The adjournment was then made in regular parliamentary form.</p>
<p>Among the clubs represented were the Every Thursday club, the Ideal club, the Woman's club, the World's Parliament club, the Review club, the Oakland Avenue Reading club, the Progress and the Onward clubs.</p>
<p>The women selected are eminently fitted for the duties they will be called upon to discharge. Mrs. Reed is a thorough business woman and before her marriage to Judge Reed, who occupies the bench in the United States court of appeals, was the president and cashier of a bank. She is bright and winsome and has a happy faculty of dealing with large undertakings and solving quickly and without jar perplexing problems. Mrs. Key is one of the best known women in Council Bluffs and is also a business woman. The two will ably represent the women of the city in the board of Lady Managers of the exposition, and they will also help to make the great show a success.</p></div2>

<ab>(Little Rock Gazette.)</ab>
<p>In conformity with the recommendation of ex-Governor Clarke a bill has been introduced in the Arkansas legislature appropriation $25,000 for an exhibit of the resources and productive industries of Arkansas at the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition of 1898 at Omaha. Iowa has already made a preliminary appropriation for that purpose and will increase it later on. A bill is pending before the Illinois legislature providing for an appropriation of $100,000, while Nebraska is now considering a bill carrying $350,000, which, it is said, will pass the legislature within the next ten days. Colorado, South Dakota, Kansas, Wyoming, Utah and many other western states in interest are now considering appropriation bills, and the prediction is that every state west of the Mississippi will participate in the great exposition of 1898. The people of Omaha have subscribed over $400,000 in stock and will raise the amount to $1,000,000. Congress has pledged $200,000 and Senator Allen says this will be increased to $275,000 this session. The selection of a site for the exposition grounds is now under discussion at Omaha and it is expected that ground will be broken within thirty days.</p>
<p>The managers of the exposition are doing their utmost to assure the people of the entire west&#8212;from the Mississippi river to the Pacific coast&#8212;that the exposition of 1898 is designed to display the resources and products of every state and territory. The population of Nebraska and states touching her borders is nearly 10,000,000, a fact which is a guarantee that the attendance at the great exposition will be enormous, to say nothing of the hundreds of thousands of people who will come from the east. The states of the south will find in the exposition unexampled opportunity for a comparative display of their productive capabilities. Recent issues of the department of publicity make full exposition of the diversified products, not only of Arkansas, but of every state and territory west of the Mississippi river. When the exhibits of these states are arrayed together in this great exposition which will open its gates in June, 1898, an object lesson will be presented to the world second only in brilliance and magnitude to the Columbian fair of 1898. It is the design of the promoters of the Trans-Mississippi exposition that the exhibits of the states in interest shall be given precedence over those of foreign nations and eastern states. The exposition is to illustrate the progress of the arts, industries and civilization of the states west of the Mississippi river, and the degree of success to be achieved will depend largely upon these states and the co-operation manifested by their legislatures and citizens generally.</p>
<p>The exposition had its origin in resolutions adopted by the Trans-Mississippi <choice><sic>commercal</sic><corr>commercial</corr></choice> congress of 1895, <choice><sic>represnting</sic><corr>representing</corr></choice> the twenty-four states and territories west of the Mississippi, <note>column ends abruptly</note></p>


<pb n="80" xml:id="TMISB02-080"/> 
            
<p>"Whereas, We believe that an exposition of all the products, industries and civilizations of the states west of the Mississippi river, made at some central gateway where the world can behold the wonderful capabilities of these wealth-producing states, would be of great value, not only to the Trans-Mississippi states, but to all the homeseekers in the world; therefore,</p>
    <p>"Resolved, That the United States congress be requested to take such steps as may be necessary to hold a Trans-Mississippi exposition at Omaha in the year 1898, and that the representatives of such states and territories in congress be requested to favor such an appropriation as is usual in such cases to assist in carrying out this enterprise."</p></div2>
    
    <div2 type="article">
        <head type="sub">"NEBRASKA IS ON TRIAL."</head>
        <p>Judge M. P. Kinkaid put the question in a nutshell when in speaking of the Trans-Mississippi exposition bill he said "Nebraska is on trial."  The committee has started on its way to visit the capitals of other states to urge appropriations for the proposed exposition of 1898.  Nebraska ought to take action during the present week.  In this matter political prejudice ought not to be permitted to enter.  Representatives of all parties ought to unite for the common purpose of accomplishing a great good for the entire state as well as for the entire west.</p>
        <p>The situation is a most critical one and no man or party can afford to be responsible for any further delay.</p>

<ab>OMAHA'S BIG SHOW.</ab>
<ab>WILL BE A WORTHY EXHIBITION.</ab>
<ab>[Special Correspondence.]</ab>
<p>OMAHA, Neb., Feb. 11.&#8212;While events in all the western states are contributing to the general interest in the trans-Mississippi exposition, Omaha and the balance of the state are considerably agitated over the preliminary arrangements incident to the selection of a site for the big fair and the appropriation of a handsome amount by the Nebraska legislature for the encourage-<unclear reason="folded"></unclear> the gigantic enterprise. The many <unclear reason="folded"></unclear> that surround this city. <unclear reason="torn">mple</unclear> scope for discussion as to the advantageous location of the affair and citizens have been holding animated discussions for several weeks on the subject. But the incident of location is not permitted to interfere with the details of promotion and the whole section is actively at work pushing the details of primary arrangement.</p>
<p>This week several public meetings have been held, at which animated discussions have been in order with reference to considerations growing out of the exposition's location. The citizens are determined that all interests shall be heard along this line and the utmost freedom is given to all who desire to in anyway express an opinion. That no assertions of unfairness should be made against the board of managers in the preliminary arrangements, two Chicago expert engineers were employed last week to visit the city and examine all the parks and other proposed sites and report on the one which could be most easily brought under the hands of the landscape artists and made to serve the purpose of a location for a mammoth exhibition of the resources of the great west. Even their report as not to be considered final and, though they reported upon Miller park, the discussion still goes on with the determination of all to see that the most available site is eventually selected.</p></div4>
        <div4>
<head type="sub">TWO SITES IN RIVALRY.</head>
<p>While there are half a dozen park within a few miles of the city and available in every way for the purposes of an exhibition similar to the one in question, the fight has really narrowed down to two places&#8212;Miller park and Hanscom park, but most delightful stretches of territory shaded by nature and arranged in a most artistic manner. Between the two sentiment is quite evenly divided, with the chances in favor of Miller park, because the Chicago experts reported that the exposition company would be able to convert that park into desirable grounds with the least expenditure and effort.</p>
<p>Hansom park stretches over sixty acres in the southwest part of the city. It is one of the oldest resorts of the kind in the city, having been donated for park purposes by A. J. Hanscom years ago. Its many great trees, pretty dells and great stretch of green commend it in many ways to Omahans, but the transportation facilities are not quite equal to those of Miller park. The park <choice><sic>commisision</sic><corr>commission</corr></choice> of the city, however, has spent thousands of dollars in the past fifteen years beautifying the property and the exposition would have the advantage of all these improvements.</p>
<p>Of Miller park, in the northern part of the city, not as much can be said for its present condition as a public pleasure resort, but it is a handsome body of land, capable of being added to indefinitely since it adjoins a great prairie territory, but it lacks the rustic beauty of its rival in the other part of the city. The experts declare that it can be brought to grade at slight expense and that the scope of elaborate improvements is practically unlimited. Further, it adjoins the abandoned military reservation of Fort Omaha, which the company proposes to utilize if congress gives its consent.</p>
<p>The best evidence of the way Omaha and Nebraska feel about the exposition is probably manifested in the manner in which the citizens have contributed their money to encourage the effort. The people of this city have already subscribed $425,000 to the enterprise, and are expected to increase the amount to $1,000,000 before the details are completed, while the county will probably issue half that amount in bonds for the same purpose. The measure before the legislature for the appropriation of $350,000 is receiving splendid support, with a small element of the body inclined to favor the loping off at least one-third of the amount. It has the support of the public men of the state, and Governor Holcomb's message to the legislature strongly advocated the most liberal treatment of the great enterprise. The body will probably make its appropriation next week. Incidentally the bill provides for a board of twelve representative citizens, who shall be appointed from the state at large, to act in conjunction with the exposition managers in promoting the interests of the affair.</p>
<p>No special effort of the state in the way of designs for buildings at the fair has yet been discussed, except in the most informal way, but it is the intention of all sections of Nebraska that a most creditable exhibition of the states resources shall be made, and that it shall be on such an elaborate plan as to challenge comparison from any part of the trans-Mississippi region. It may take the line of a picture of Nebraska in miniature, showing the vast area of fertile valleys, rivers, the magnificent system of irrigating canals covering hundreds of miles, assuring a plentiful supply of moisture by artificial methods if nature should at any time fail in her bounty, incidentally indicating some unique features of modern irrigating arrangements, and concluding with a sketch showing the vast scope of the cattle industry of Nebraska with the gridiron of railroads which cover the state.</p></div4>
        <div4>
<head type="sub">THE SILVER PALACE.</head>
<p>While no definite plans have matured for these features in Nebraska, other sections have made very definite progress in the way of proposed exhibitions at the fair calculated to please the visitors as well as give to the world an accurate idea of some of the interesting resources of the west. Probably the feature that has thus far been given the most prominence is the proposed silver palace, which is expected to be the principal feature of the mineral exhibit. The sketch of the structure submitted by S. S. Herman, a Chicago architect, shows a building <unclear reason="blurry"></unclear> similar in the world's fair Venetian palace, with a highly ornamented tower in the center 250 feet high, with eight lower towers of probably half that height. The style is to be Gothic and the whole is to be plated with silver.  The plans are very elaborate, and if carried to completion as at present arranged it will embody one of the most novel things in the way of a building ever placed before the people of the world. The cost will be something enormous, but the capital for the enterprise is said to be in sight.</p>
<p>In the interior of this building will probably be a reproduction in miniature of the most famous mines of the continent, and as a side feature there will be a little affair wrought in the rarest gems and richest ores obtainable, to be known as the mines of Solomon, from which the great stores of wealth with which that monarch dazzled the ancients were supposed to have been taken.</p></div4>
        <div4>
<head type="sub">AN INDIAN DISPLAY.</head>
<p>Another novel design already incubating is to represent all the Indian tribes which roamed the territory west of the Mississippi with the war implements and jewelry of the tribesmen, together with their instruments of art and other peaceful industries. This may involve the presence of some of the most famous living Indian warriors, and plainsmen who contributed so largely to driving the redman into the depth of the wilderness and forced him to surrender the lands of his fathers to the onmarching civilization. Trophies obtained by the pioneers, as well as their ancient antagonists on the field of battle, will be on exhibition.</p>
                <p>The managers of the exposition have also decided to have a department devoted to the Grand Army of the Republic, and to gather under the supervision of that organization many mementoes of the late rebellion in the shape of war relics and things associated with the great commanders, who contributed to the stirring events of the contest.</p>
                <p>It is quite certain that artificial lakes of very elaborate construction will be leading features of the exposition. This will be partly for the reason that they will easily beautify the landscape which might otherwise partake too severely of a <choice><sic>wodland</sic><corr>woodland</corr></choice> scene, and also for the reason that irrigation and its remarkable progress as developed in the west under modern teachings and the investments of great fortunes, will be side lights of much importance in the exhibition. An unlimited supply of water is easily obtained from the Missouri, and some of the sites discussed contemplate placing the exposition so that the current of the great river, or such part of it as may be desired shall be turned directly into the exposition grounds, so that magnificent waterfalls, carrying great volumes of water, can be erected, together with lakes that may add something of grandeur and dignity to the general scene.</p></div4>
        <div4>
<head type="sub">PROMOTERS OF THE SHOW.</head>
                <p>The men promoting the show which is to dazzle the country in 1898 are the most representative citizens in Omaha and the state generally. Most of them are well known far beyond the confines of their states. Gurdon W. Wattles is president of the exposition. He is vice president of the exposition. He is vice president of the Union National bank and a splendid type of the energetic western man. He devotes many hours daily to the exposition, but receives no compensation for his efforts. This was the first thing determined upon by the directory&#8212;that none of the offices would receive a dollar for their services, other than those serving in a clerical capacity.</p>
                <p>Alvin Saunders, resident vice president, is a pioneer of the state and a representative business man. His large business interest and conservative business training makes him a valuable adjunct to the directory.</p>
                <p>Edward Rosewater, editor in chief of the Omaha Bee, is at the head of the department of publicity, and is bringing all of his energy and newspaper training to bear on advancing the interest and placing before the public ideas as to the elaborate exhibition proposed.</p></div4>
        <div4>
<head type="sub">RAILWAYS LEND A HAND.</head>
                <p>But the strongest feature of the promoting arrangements is in the fact that every citizen of the state is bending all his efforts to contribute to the success of the enterprise. General Manager Bidwell of the Northwestern has just placed at the disposal of the exposition his private car, and a committee will shortly visit Pierre, S. D., and St. Paul is in the interest of the enterprise. The railroads are doing their share handsomely in the premises. The Union Pacific has also placed at the committee's disposal a private car for a delegation to visit Colorado, Kansas and Illinois. The St. Paul committee will be headed by Chairman Lindsey and that to Illinois will consist of President Wattles, W. J. Bryan and W. G. Hitchcock, editor of the World-Herald. These committees are expected to promote the interests of the exposition in various ways and particularly before the legislatures of the various states considering appropriations in aid of the trans-Mississippi committee of big wholesalers and jobbers from Missouri points will shortly visit Chicago and make a showing to the many manufacturers and wholesalers of that section who sell to this territory. They will be given some idea as to the magnitude of the exposition and just how great an interest the wholesalers of Illinois have in contributing to the success of the big enterprise. They will easily see that as a medium for advertising the approaching fair will offer unsurpassed facilities and for showing the other industries tributary to the manufacturing industries of Illinois no greater opportunity could be offered than the exhibition at Omaha in 1898.</p>

<head type="sub">WILL HAVE CHARGE OF GROUNDS.</head>
<p>OMAHA, Neb., Feb. 13.&#8212;F. P. Kirkendall of the department of grounds of the exposition has received a telegram from Dion Geraldine, general superintendent of the world's fair at Chicago, accepting the offer of a similar position for the exposition here in 1898. A committee representing the exposition has arranged to leave here Sunday night for a short trip in which it will visit the legislatures in several states and advocate the interests of the exposition. It will go first to Topeka, where it will be on Monday. It will go to Denver, where arrangements have been made for a joint session of the two houses of the state legislature to accommodate the committee on Tuesday. It will then go to Cheyenne for Wednesday and to Salt Lake City for Thursday. It has not been definitely settled who will form the party, but it will be headed by W. J. Bryan.</p></div3></div2>

<p>Down in the right-hand corner of the Methodist Episcopal church Saturday afternoon there were four or five newspaper men who for the time being felt as insignificant as a tear drop in a mint julep for in front of them in all the luxury of beauty natural and artificial that makes the American <choice><sic>womon</sic><corr>women</corr></choice> so attractive in the eyes of fortune hunting nobility, and so noble and endearing to their own plain, rugged American cousins sat "three hundred, thirty, odd," as our up-to-date school professors would p al it off, of South Omaha's most prominent and active stars in the feminine firmament. It was the largest crowd of female features that ever touched skirts with each other in the magic burg, and you didn't have to look through a marine glass to see that it was there for a purpose. Women either turn out in such numbers to listen to a church program, or else to fight and they were there to do the latter at the drop of the hat. But no hat dropped. We've wandered into several political conventions and applauded the smooth way in which one faction not knowing how large its strength, manipulated, through the tactics of one or two shrewd leaders, the body at will; we've envied the success of the Ohio man who commencing as a dismal minority gradually grew and forced into oblivion the long recognized hercules of the g. o. p; and we've pulled our whiskers with pleasure over the way the council has grown from a chaotic mass of inter-logger-heads into the solid eight, but we have never seen anything yet in any point of managerial cleverness to compare with the amiable rough shod, invincible and gumdrop control taken over Saturday's meeting by the winning faction. We are taking it for granted that the whole affair was prearranged, if not hats must be taken off in reverence to the greatest piece of method-like <choice><sic>innocense</sic><corr>innocence</corr></choice> that has broken loose in our midst since Bruno Strathman blew the foam off a glass of water at the Towl-Johnston convention. The meeting was called to order at the Y.M.C.A. rooms by Mrs. M. C. Smith who without wasting any words nominated Miss Hetty Moore, the High School Goddess of Instruction for madame chairman, and without wasting anymore time put the nomination to a vote, and declared the lady of learning elected. Miss Hetty assumed the chair with a carriage, expression and activity that shows her to have been forewarned, or to be a very good imitation of a stoic, and that she didn't propose to permit any caramel work to go on while she was looking, and she didn't. Someone named Mrs. Josephine Carroll for secretary, and another person named Mrs. M Carl Smith. "Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Carroll have been nominated for secretary," announced Chairmadame Hettie, "now all in favor of Mrs. Smith will please say aye; contrary no." Of course Chairmadame Hetty didn't in a thousand years intend to keep any one from a chance to vote for Mrs. Carroll, women are not so horrid in such affairs as men, but when the reporter caught sight of the expression of lovable innocence that frisked about her features as she thus arbitrarily chocked off at least a portion of the expression of the convention's sentiment he wondered why women have so long been kept out politics. Mrs. Smith having taken up the secretary's quill someone looked out in the street and saw several hundred women who couldn't get into the hall and suggested an adjournment to the Methodist church which was at once acted upon. As soon as it reconvened Chairmadame Hetty with another delightful expression of <choice><sic>innocense</sic><corr>innocence</corr></choice> produced a card and announced the following as tellers to take charge of the voting:</p>
                <p>Martha Evans, chairmadame, Miss Pollard, Mrs. Cressey, Miss Littell, Mrs. J. L. Martin, Mrs. Pinnell, Mrs. Montgomery, Mrs. M. Redmond, Mrs. Witten and Mrs. Schrei.</p>
                <p>Some of the girls thought the chair ought to be polite enough to wait for instructions before going ahead as if she were the great dynamo but didn't say it except in their balloon sleeves, which of course didn't count.</p>
                <p>While the tellers were making the rounds for nominations from fifteen to twenty more or less lusty lunged females were on the floor for five full minutes each firing away some suggestion, sarcasm or platitude, and the cackling was as inspiring as that which occasionally follows, in a respectable hen society, the laying of a bright new egg. Chairmadame Moore recognized everyone as fast as they got up, but she didn't recognize what they said, at least she never let anything go to a vote and as this sort of work had a paralytic effect upon those who might have felt like kicking, there was no objection. Only once was this monarchical manner of running things given a jolt that brought a diamond-dyed frown upon the faces of the push. During a moment of absent mindness the chair without consulting her card to see if it was on the docket recognized Mrs. H. J. Aberly. The latter had a <choice><sic>greviance</sic><corr>grievance</corr></choice>. She had been making a house to house visit for two or three days to convey the fact she was a candidate for directress but in someway the papers had omitted her named, just as they did scores of others, from the list of candidates. This fact had made her wrathy and she arose to tell the convention that while no newspaper had spoken of her as being a candidate she wanted it distinctly understood that she was, and would be in it to the last. The reporters took off their overcoats at the sarcastic way she shot her preliminary remarks at them, and it was quite tropical even with the mercury all in the bulb, during the rest of <choice><sic>of</sic><corr></corr></choice> the session in consequence. Chairmadame Hetty was appalled at the audacity of the woman in so openly electioneering for herself, and tried to stop her, but Mrs. Aberly only quit when she got ready. A few minutes latter when the tellers' record showed on the informal ballot that she had received just one lone, lorn vote it was quite apparent to observers that after being so emphatic in her declaration that she was a candidate. Mrs. Aberly must have used some occult force in communicating to her friends that she was not.</p>
<p>The nominating vote brought out the names of the following:</p>

                <div3>
                <p>In the house at Washington this afternoon the sundry civil appropriation bill was passed without division. This bill carries $200,000 for the Transmississippi Exposition. It is subject to amendment in the senate, where an effort will be made to secure the $275,000 recommended by the Treasury department as being necessary to make the proper government display. Senator Thurston has reported from his committee on international expositions Senator Allen's amended bill making this provision, and Senator Allison, who is chairman of the senate committee on finance, has agreed to allow the house appropriation bill to be amended in accordance with the plan. He preferred that the house bill should take the provision, but the economical element in the house committee on appropriations was against more than the original bill carried. This amount, $200,000, will become immediately available, and will allow work to begin on the government buildings at once. The plans for the government buildings have been under consideration for a long time, only awaiting the appropriation before beginning work.</p>
                <p>Secretary Wakefield of the exposition association has received letters from Congressmen Strode, Meiklejohn and Kem in reply to letters sent sometime ago, in which he requested them to name the time and place for holding mass meetings of women of their districts for the purpose of electing two women from each district to be members of the Board of Lady Managers of the exposition.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WHERE THEY WILL MEET.</head>
                <p>In each instance the congressman leaves the dates of the meeting to Secretary Wakefield, but the place at which the meeting shall be held is fixed by each of the congressmen. Congressman Strode of the First district fixes Lincoln as the place at which the meeting of that district shall be held: Congressman Meiklejohn names Fremont as the place at which the women of the Third district shall assemble to elect two representatives, and Congressman Kem names Broken Bow as the point at which the women of the Sixth congressional district shall assemble. Secretary Wakefield has opened correspondence with the mayors of each of the towns named by the congressmen, and has asked those officials to select a hall or other suitable place in which these meetings may be held and notify him, after which he will issue a call for a mass meetings in each district. The date of these meetings will probably be Wednesday of next week, and the Department of Publicity will assist the secretary in disseminating the notices of the meetings and the purposes for which the women will be elected.</p>
                <p>Dion Geraldine, the newly appointed superintendent of construction of the exposition under the Department of Buildings and Grounds, was expected to arrive in the city today, but Manager Kirkendall received a telegram from him this morning, saying that <unclear reason="folded"></unclear>arrive tomorrow and be ready to <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>take up the work of his department. In the meantime Manager Kirkendall is being flooded with applications for the positions of supervising architect and assistant architects, but he has told all that the time for making these selections has not arrived and that nothing will be done along that line until the time comes.</p></div3></div2>
            
<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">WILL VISIT TEN WESTERN STATES.</head>
<head type="sub">Committee Leaves on an Errand of Instruction and Promotion.</head>
                <p>The sleeper "Silver City," gaily bedecked with two enormous streams which bore the legend "Omaha, 1898, Transmississippi and International Exposition, from June to November," left the Union depot last night attached to the south-bound Kansas City, St. Joseph and Council Bluffs 10-o'clock train. On board was a committee of Omaha business men, six in number, representing the exposition, and upon them will devolve the work of laying the subject of state exhibits before the various legislatures now in session throughout the western country.</p>
                <p>Those who compose the party are G. W. Wattles, G. M. Hitchcock, John L. Webster, H. E. Palmer, William S. Poppleton and Clement Chase. The directors are accompanied by their wives. The itinerary of the tour comprises visits to the capitals of ten states. In the order of visiting they are as follows: Topeka, Kan.; Denver, Colo.; Cheyenne, Wyo.; Salt Lake City, Utah; Helena, Mont.; Boise City, Idaho; Olympia, Wash.; Salem, Ore.; Sacramento, Cal.; and Carson City, Nev.</p>
                <p>It is expected that the trip will consume <choice><sic>abut</sic><corr>about</corr></choice> three weeks, although no visits of more than two days will be given any one point. Most of the capitals visited will be accorded but a single day, but due to the large mileage covered it is thought by the party that three weeks time will be necessary.</p>
                <p>In speaking of the prospects of the journey last evening, Mr. Wattles said: "We are going to give the legislative bodies we visit the best inducements in our possession in order to make them come forward with the requisite appropriations needed for the exhibits. In starting at this time with our own appropriations till in the balance, we feel that an extra effort upon our part will be necessary to place the matter before the various bodies in the proper light. We expect, however, to receive telegrams before we have been on the road a week that the bill in our own state has gone through with a liberal appropriation.</p>
                <p>"The first stop will be made at Topeka, where we arrive Monday morning. After seeing the proper persons, we leave there at 10 p.m. for Denver. I think we will have a most cordial welcome in the mountain city, as we most assuredly did upon our former visit. The Colorado exhibit will undoubtedly be a handsome one, and an appropriation commensurate with it will go through the house with a rush.</p>
                <p>"We will be traveling almost constantly, but think there will be considerable variety in the many cities visited. We will probably reach home about March 7."</p>
                <p>Apropos to the departure of the committee on this trip the Department of Promotion announces that it has received much information of an encouraging character in the past few days from many of the states in the transmississippi country relative to appropriations for state exhibits.</p>
                <p>Word has been received by The Bee from Idaho that, although the full amount called for by the bill introduced last week at Boise, may not be passed, a reasonable appropriation is certain.</p></div2>
            
<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">MANY ARE APPLYING FOR SPACE.</head>
<head type="sub">Transmississippi Exposition the Center for All Kinds of Exhibits.</head>
                <p>Applications for space at the exposition continue to pour into the Department of Exhibits and a very flattering showing has been made in a number of different lines. The line which seems to be receiving the most attention is amusements in the nature of those which formed the immortal Midway Plaisance at the World's fair, Already a number of applications for attractions in this line have been received and the latest is an application for 50,000 square feet for a Chinese exhibit. The application for this large space was made a few days ago by H. Sling of Chicago, a native of China, who had charge of the Chinese concession in the Midway.</p>
                <p>Mr. Sling was in town last week and was introduced to Manager Reed by some prominent people of Omaha, who vouched for his financial responsibility. He informed Mr. Reed that he proposed to install a Chinese theater, a village, tea garden, joss house, restaurant and a booth for selling Chinese and Japanese wares. His application was placed on file for future action.</p>
                <p>The exposition authorities are becoming aroused to the fact that some measures will have to be adopted to prevent the large number of entertainments naturally attendant upon such an affair as the exposition from locating outside the grounds, thereby detracting from the exposition in many way. These shows will attract the dollars from the pockets of the people before they get inside the exposition, and the exposition itself will not derive any pecuniary benefit from these outside exhibits.</p>
                <p>The difficulty to be encountered in connection with the site which has been selected for the exposition lies in the fact that there is an unlimited quantity of vacant land lying outside of the exposition grounds. The proprietors of prospective shows will endeavor to secure ground outside of the exposition grounds for the reason that they can probably make lower terms with the owners of such ground than could be made with the exposition officials. It is probable that the city council will be asked to pass ordinances requiring a high licence for shows and entertainments during the progress of the exposition, with a view of forcing these concerns to go inside of the exposition grounds.</p>
                <p>Some of the exposition officials who have been in Lincoln during the past few days report that there is a sentiment among the members of the legislature that money which may be voted for the exposition by the state is likely to be dissipated in the way of salaries for the officers or directors of the exposition, and they are opposing the appropriation for that reason. In this connection Secretary Wakefield calls attention to the first resolution passed by the board of directors at its first meeting and before any officers had been elected. The resolution is as follows:</p>
                <p>Resolved, That no director of this corporation shall receive any compensation for services performed in any capacity for the corporation.</p>
                <p>This resolution was unanimously adopted and is still in force.</p></div2>

                <head type="sub">Accused of Tampering With the Ballots.</head>
                <p>Newspapers often have good intentions, but not always are they discovered to the public. Yesterday we undertook to express the pleasure afforded us by Chairmadame Hetty Moore in her management of Saturday's convention; to reveal to the male population the charmingly determined autocratic way in which she made every one wilt before her authority; how everything though transparently "fixed" before hand was ushered through in the most innocent and amiable kind of a manner; and in other ways to show that the ladies can give the men all kinds of pointers and then some on the art of parliamentary machine work.

<pb n="85" xml:id="TMISB02-085"/> 



Call a man a shrewd parliamentarian or political manager and will take you into a saloon and buy you the best in the house.</p>
<p>The brownies swore of Jan. 1 1897, and of course did not expect any such reward from the manipulators of Saturday's circus, but neither did they look for an exhibition of the proverbial perversity of women. But the latter came all right and in no other form than that of a general roast for putting such a construction as they did on the acts of the ladies. Some of the dear girls thought we were real cruel in making Chairmadame Hetty as a sort of a boss, or the perfunctory mouth piece of a faction that had agreed upon its line of work, and assert that whatever she did as in accordance with either her ignorance of the way she was being used, or her ideas of the duties of a chairmadame. And on this subject nothing more need be said. But if there is anything who thinks the convention adjourned under the influence of love and mutual admiration let him or her take a skate through some of the haunts of the women who were there.</p>
<p>A volcano in active operation is about the condition of things under the crust of appearances, for the ladies are madder than whitewashed setting-hens over certain incidents of the convention which at the time was unperceived by them. Though the members of the teller's committee were social queens and paragonesses of female perfection and nobility and were under the leadership of the doughty, energetic and watchful Miss Martha Evans, it is not keeping them from being actually accused of tampered with the votes and miscalling the true vote. The amazing gossip is circulating about like a lost bolt of electricity that Mrs. Mead was "deliberately" cheated out of an election, and by these same tellers not counting the votes cast for her. This charge is so much like those that are in evidence after the local democratic conventions that one has to think a half a half dozen times before he believes it to exist. Before the convention the Mead supporters were willing to bet 16 to 1 that their candidate would be elected, and they are just as confident now that she was elected according to the bonafide vote. of course it is all over, and there's the spilled milk idea, and all that, but the ladies don't care. They are all torn up, and they think it's real mean. Mrs. Carroll's friends are on the gridiron of anger because her name was not voted on for secretary. Mrs. Aberly is the only one who feels real easy over the results. While there's lots of fun in the scrap for the newspapers, there is every reason for believing that the kickers should imitate the action of the clam, and keep silent. Had they gone into the convention as well organized as the Towl-Munro forces, and not got rattled, and made a sky-rocket kick every time an unparliamentary act was committed the result might have been different, but.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><dateline>THE WORLD-HERALD: OMAHA, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1897.</dateline>
    <head type="main">JUDGE SCOTT ON THE EXPOSITION BILL.</head>
<p>OMAHA, Feb. 13.&#8212;To the Editor of the World-Herald: It would be disastrous to all portions and business interests of the state if the legislature should not grant a liberal appropriation to aid the Trans-Mississippi exposition.</p>
<p>This is an enterprise calculated to advertise and bring prominently before the people of the world the fertility of our soil, our climatic advantages, our educational facilities and the very high percentage of intelligence of our people as shown by the census of 1890, as compared with the comparatively low average of the people of some of the eastern states whose press and senators have so unjustly sought to place the people of Nebraska before the world as unfit to exercise the privileges of American citizens.</p>
<p>I desire to say further that if that grand enterprise was intended to be, or would be, an Omaha enterprise and for the benefit of Omaha only, and not for the benefit of the entire state of Nebraska and her people in all conditions and callings, I would oppose the appropriation by the state of a single dollar, but I have too much confidence in the broad and liberal-mindedness of the people of the state outside of Omaha and in their just pride in the state to believe for one moment that they will regard the enterprise of more interest to the city of Omaha than to the entire state.</p>
<p>It is entirely too contracted a view, in my judgment, to charge that it is an exclusively Omaha enterprise, for the exclusive benefit of Omaha, unless they are justified in concluding that Omaha is not a part of the great state of Nebraska, a conclusion no one can be so foolish as to entertain.</p>
<p>In my judgment that exposition, if successfully carried out&#8212;and much depends upon the state whether the enterprise will be successful&#8212;will be a lasting benefit to all the western states, and to the state of Nebraska in particular. Other western states are getting in line, and propose to aid the enterprise by liberal appropriations because they know what great benefits will result to them if the exposition is made a success. Can Nebraska afford to do less? A commendable state pride and a  common interest require that the state of Nebraska should do much for this exposition. The states of the great west expect this of her.</p>
<p>I am opposed alike to a stinted or an extravagant appropriation, but I am certainly in favor of such an appropriation as will go out to the world as an evidence of the broad and liberal policy of the people of this state. Anything less than that will rob the state of the benefits that it would otherwise receive from the exposition, and would, moreover, in my judgment, put the state in a bad light before the people of the word.</p>
<p>I believe that $200,000 would meet the approval of the taxpayers of the state, and I have such an abiding confidence in the wisdom and patriotic pride of the members of our legislature that they will in that regard, as well as in all others, fully measure up to the expectations of the people.</p>

<div2 type="article"><head type="main">ROYAL RECEPTION AT TOPEKA</head>
<head type="sub">Warm Welcome to the Trans-Mississippi Exposition Delegation.</head>
<head type="sub">Joint Session of the Legislature Held&#8212;Special Meeting With the Ways and Means Committee&#8212;Favorable Action Is Anticipated.</head>
<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
<p>Topeka, Kas., Feb. 15.&#8212;The exposition delegation arrived at the capital city of Kansas about 1 o'clock and was agreeably surprised to learn that the senate and house of representatives had adopted a concurrent resolution this morning to hold joint session in representative hall this afternoon and listen to the exposition delegation. This action was taken on suggestion of Governor Leedy, who sent a message to both houses making the suggestion. The joint committee of the house and senate escorted the Omaha delegation from the Copeland hotel to the capital building, where the joint session awaited their coming.</p>
<p>When the lieutenant governor announced our arrival at the door the members of both houses rose in their places and remained standing till we had been seated before the speaker's desk. When all had resumed their seats the lieutenant governor asked the exposition delegation how it desired to present the matter. As manager of department of promotion, I replied that President Wattles would open by giving an outline history of the exposition project, that Hon. John L. Webster would follow in a speech showing the scope and character of the exposition and that I would ask privilege of concluding the hearing by showing the reason for the undertaking and its beneficial effects on the west.</p>
<p>This was carried out and our addresses occupied a little over an hour altogether. The senators and members listened attentively and on several occasions gave generous applause. This was notable when the name of Mr. Bryan was mentioned as the author of the original resolution passed by the Commercial congress, providing for the exposition.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the speeches the announcement was made that the pages would distribute to members copies of the exposition pamphlet, issued by the department of promotion last week. The exposition delegation was then invited to accompany the senators to the senate chamber and were given chairs on the floor, from which they watched the routine proceedings till Governor Leedy's private secretary, Mr. Fieharty, came to invite them to the governor's office, where a conference was held. It was there decided to have a joint meeting of the ways and means committee of both houses in the governor's office in the evening. Meanwhile the rest of the afternoon was filled in by calls at the office of the Topeka Capital and State Journal, as well as upon Mayor Fellows, who is vice president of the exposition for Kansas. Here the delegation met ex-Governor Glick, who takes a warm interest in the exposition project.</p>
<p>The delegation felt greatly encouraged as a result of the afternoon's work and especially at the strong support given by Governor Leedy, ex-Governor Glick and Mayor Fellows.</p>
<p>The evening meeting with the ways and means committees was looked forward to with some misgivings, however, because that committee had made such a reputation for cutting down or refusing appropriations.</p>
<p>When the meeting was called to order four committees were represented, they being the ways and means of both houses and the committees on agriculture of both houses. Besides these members of the legislature were Governor Leedy, ex-Governor Glick and ex-Governor Lewelling. The conference lasted nearly two hours, and short talks were made by most members of the Nebraska delegation as well as by many committeemen and both ex-governors.</p>
<p>Many questions were asked, and Mr. Wattles delegated me to reply to them. In this way the members of the committee gained a fairly clear idea of the enterprise, and from expressions of opinions freely made it was evident that the exposition found great favor.</p>
<p>Before adjourning the meeting took a rising vote and thanked the exposition delegation for its visit and information. It is generally expected that a favorable report will be made on the exposition bill this week. We leave for Denver at 10 o'clock and reach there Tuesday afternoon. I read to the conference the following letter from Mr. Bryan:</p>
<p>Lincoln, Neb., Feb. 13.&#8212;To G. M. Hitchcock, Omaha, Neb.&#8212;My Dear Sir: Other engagements make it impossible for me to accompany our party, but I am sure that the advantages of the exposition are so apparent that all western states will readily make the appropriations necessary for suitable exhibits. The resources of the west are not fully understood by many of our eastern brethren, and I am sure that the exposition by cultivating a more intimate acquaintance will be of great benefit to the trans-Mississippi country. In haste, yours, truly,</p>

<p>Another party of exposition promoters started from Omaha last night to visit the states lying to the north and appear before their legislatures for the purpose of exploiting the exposition and showing why the legislatures should make liberal appropriations for displaying the resources of their states. The party was under the leadership of Chairman Z. T. Lindsey of the executive committee and comprised the following gentlemen: L. C. Crofoot, I. W. Carpenter, president of the Carpenter Paper company and  a director in the exposition, and C. M. Harl of Council Bluffs. The party left Omaha at 6:15 o'clock over the Sioux City &amp; Pacific, and was to be increased at Sioux City by the addition of a prominent citizen of that place. From Sioux City the party will proceed direct to Duluth, Minn., reaching that point at 1:30 p. m., today. The members will remain in Duluth until 11 o'clock tonight, when they will start for St. Paul, reaching the state capital in the morning. Here the party will appear before the legislature, and will start the next morning for Bismarck, N. D. From Bismarck the party will go to Pierre, S. D., and will return to Omaha, reaching here Saturday night of this week. The delegation will travel in the private car of General Manager Bidwell of the Elkhorn.</p>
<p>The delegation which will visit the southern states has been made up and will start tomorrow night to visit the legislatures of the southern transmississippi states. This tour will include a visit to the capital of the Republic of Mexico, where a strong effort will be made to interest President Diaz in the exposition, with a view of securing an exhibit from that country. This party will be under the guidance of C. S. Montgomery, counselor for the Exposition association, and will include Postmaster Euclid Martin, E. J. Cornish, member of the Board of Park Commissioners; Rev. S. Wright Butler, and Judge Cornish of Lincoln. This delegation will go direct to Jefferson City, Mo., to appear before the Missouri legislature, and will then proceed to Little Rock, Ar., where the legislature will be enlightened regarding the exposition. From Arkansas the party will proceed to Austin, appearing before the legislature of Texas, and the route from there will probably include Galveston and Laredo. From here the delegation will proceed to the capital of Mexico.</p>
<p>In Mexico the party will be under the guidance of Postmaster Martin, who telegraphed to the secretary of state for credentials before leaving Omaha. The delegation will appear before President Diaz and will enlighten him regarding the exposition with a view of securing his co-operation in securing a large exhibit from the dominion of the president.</p></div3>

<head type="sub">Scope and Plans of the Exposition Are Explained.</head>
<p>TOPEKA, Kan., Feb. 16.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;Yesterday and last night the Transmississippi Exposition had a long inning before the Kansas legislature. The committee from Omaha was welcomed by the legislature in friendly fashion and given an opportunity to tell all it knows about the enterprise it is pushing. As a result the outlook for the participation in the exposition by Kansas on a liberal scale is very much brighter than it was last week. The committee reached the city about 1 o'clock, and went at once to the capitol building, where both houses of the legislature had assembled in joint session to receive the Omaha delegation. A committee had been appointed by the legislature to receive the visitors and escort them to the capital, and under the direction of this committee the Omahans were escorted to the speaker's desk, the legislators receiving them standing.</p>
<p>At the suggestion of the lieutenant governor, who asked the committee how it desired to proceed, Mr. Hitchcock, manager of the Department of Promotion, asked President Wattles to present the exposition matter. The president gave an outline of the history of the enterprise, and was followed by John L. Webster, who went a little more into detail on the topic. Careful attention and generous applause was given the speakers. Copies of the exposition pamphlet were distributed, and then the committee visited the senate and watched the proceedings for a time. From here the members went to Governor Leedy's office, where a conference was held. It was there decided that a meeting of the ways and means committee would be held in the evening, and that the Omaha delegation should have an opportunity to talk business to the committee.</p>
<p>The conference in the evening was a most important one. There were present four committees of the legislature, the ways and means committees of both houses, and the agricultural committees. Besides these there were present Governor Leedy, ex-Governor Lewelling and ex-Governor Glick, Mayor Fellows of Topeka and other influential and interested citizens. Many questions were asked of the visitors during the two hours of conference, and all were answered in detail by Mr. Hitchcock, who presented the side of the exposition. Before the committee adjourned a vote of thanks was tendered the visitors for the information given.</p>
<p>A favorable report on the exposition appropriation bill is generally expected next</p>

<p>the Educational department of the exposition regarding the election of officers for their department. The plan under which the Board of Lady Managers has been called into existence provides that the body "shall elect its own officers" and no condition is imposed as to whether the officers of the board shall be elected from among the members of the board or from the outside. This has thrown down the bars to all comers and will allow of the greatest latitude in the selection of officers. It has been claimed that the board is prohibited from going outside of its own members in the election of a president, but a careful scrutiny of the plan of organization on file in the office of Secretary Wakefield shows beyond any doubt that this position is not sustained by facts.</p>
<p>A number of candidates from Omaha for the presidency of this board have been mentioned during the past few days, and the contest is becoming interesting. The name of Mrs. C. F. Manderson has been urged from a number of directions and a majority of the Omaha members have expressed the greatest gratification at the prospect of having a woman of national reputation at the head of the board. Mrs. Henry W. Yates and Mrs. W. P. Harford, the latter the president of the Woman's club, have also been mentioned in this connection. Of the candidates, Mrs. Harford is the only one who is a member of the board. The Omaha members of the board, however, will constitute a minority of the board, being but eleven out of a total membership of twenty-seven, and a formidable candidate may arise among the women to be elected from the several congressional districts or from those elected in South Omaha or Council Bluffs.</p>
<p>It is conceded on all hands that the secretary should not be elected from among the members of the board, for the reason that her duties will probably occupy all her time, and she should therefore be paid. The plan of organization provides, however, that no member of the board shall receive any pay for services rendered, being exactly similar in this respect to the rule adopted by the directors of the exposition.</p>
<p>Two candidates for the position of secretary have been mentioned from among the women of Omaha. Mrs. Frances M. Ford has filed an application with Secretary Wakefield for the position and accompanies it with a letter, in which she states that she has been urged by her friends in the Woman's club to make application. Mrs. Julia Crissey Hoobler has been prominently mentioned for the position and there are other candidates who will probably be made public within a few days.</p>
<p>A sentiment has gained ground with some of the women that the women of the state should be given recognition by being elected as officers of the board, so that, altogether, the situation is becoming more complicated every day.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Sketch of Dr. Campbell Fair, Who May Come to Omaha.</head>
<p>Dr. Campbell Fair of Grand Rapids, Mich., who has been called to officiate as dean of Trinity cathedral in this city, will, accompanied by his wife, arrive in Omaha next Saturday. He will occupy the pulpit at Trinity both morning and evening, returning home next Monday morning. While in this city the reverend gentleman will be the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Henry W. Yates.

He began his ministry in Holy Trinity church, Birkenhead, Liverpool, at the age of 23 years. He then went successively to Dublin, London and Birmingham. He often relates how he came to think of America. After his ministry at Birmingham he was injured in a railroad accident, and came to America with his mother on a visit for his health. He

subsequently made his home in New Orleans, where he lived five years, and also in New York. He afterwards settled in Baltimore, where he became rector of the Church of the Ascension. It was here that he met his present wife, who was then Mary Stone, the daughter of one of the prominent vestrymen in the church. The wedding occurred January 16, 1883. The marriage ceremony was solemnized by the bishop of the parish, assisted by twenty-two of the clergy. His ministry at Baltimore was a very successful one, and extended until his call to Grand Rapids. He has never been given to sensationalism, yet his work has shone out for its clear cut motive and character. He is a member of almost every important fraternal body in the city of Grand Rapids and is an earnest worker in sectarian movements and crusades. He is a practical Christian and his robes are never too pure to darken the doors of vice when on a mission of mercy to succor the fallen or rescue the youth on the downward path. He is a member of the Kent County Humane society, the Kent Scientific institute, the Municipal League, the Grand Rapids Historical society, president of the Butterworth hospital, and was president of the Ministers' conference until he resigned a short time ago. He is president of the Grand Rapids Convocation of the Episcopal church, and in other ecclesiastical positions he will be sadly missed. He has officiated at many of the more important weddings and funerals that have occurred in Grand Rapids during his pastorate. He came to St. Mark's parish in march, 1886, as a visitor and received a call which he declined. The call was renewed. He accepted in August and took charge of the parish in November, 1886. Then began his memorable work in Grand Rapids which has so wed him to St.  Marks' that he says it is to him the most attractive parish in the United States. His home at the rectory is the favorite haunt of many of his parishioners. His charming wife and two bright, promising boys make the rectory a home par excellence. Mrs. Fair is a tireless worker and a great inspiration to her husband.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Are Assured of Very Hearty Support on All Sides&#8212;-Public Meeting at Denver and Earnest Addresses Made.</head>
<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
<p>Denver, Colo., Feb. 16.&#8212;The exposition delegation reached Denver at 2 o'clock this afternoon and was received at the depot by a committee headed by Vice President Steele of the chamber of commerce. After a hasty lunch at the Brown Palace hotel, the full delegation visited the capitol building and appeared before the meeting of the ways and means committee of both houses. An hour and a half was occupied in explaining the details of the exposition project to the members of these committees and several members from both senate and house responded in such a manner as to give reasonable assurance that the committees would at an early date report favorably upon Senator Reuter's bill for a Colorado appropriation.</p>
<p>At 8 o'clock in the evening the house of representatives was thrown open for a public meeting to which the citizens of Denver were invited and it was largely attended by senators and representatives. Lieutenant Governor Brush presided and introduced Mayor McMurray, who was formerly a resident of Omaha, but who has lived in Denver during the last eight or ten years. Mayor McMurray welcomed the visiting delegation in friendly words and assured them that Colorado would not be wanted when the exposition was opened.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Governor Brush then introduced me, and I covered the subject in a general way, particularly setting forth that the present time was the most propitious for an exposition for the reason that it was most needed.</p>
<p>The next speaker for the exposition was John L. Webster, who made a forcible and effective address. He was followed by William G. Poppleton, who won frequent applause by the effective way in which he presented the advantages of the enterprise and the desirability of bringing the west together both for commercial and political purposes.</p>
<p>In conclusion Lieutenant Governor Brush presented President Wattles of the exposition company, who set forth in a brief, business-like manner the reasons why the exposition was originally undertaken and why the business men of the west were now devoting time and money to it.</p>
<p>On the whole, the meeting was both appreciative and enthusiastic and such assurances were made in speeches and in private conversation as leave but little doubt in the minds of the members of the delegation that Colorado, notwithstanding the difficulties in her way, will make a sufficient appropriation to display her resources at the exposition.</p>
<p>All the newspapers of Denver have been particularly generous in their treatment of the subject and all the visitors and there is no question but that public sentiment here will support the legislature in making an appropriation. Colorado is anxious to attract the attention of the world, and the strong men of Colorado have become convinced that this is the means of doing it. The real question is, how much Colorado can give in the present embarrassed condition of her treasury and with the obstacle of the constitutional provision which limits her state levy to 4 miles. I think you can expect a favorable report from the ways and means committee during the present week, and I predict that we will hear very shortly that the legislature has acted upon that report favorably.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning at 4 o'clock we leave for Wyoming, where we have a joint session of the legislature in Cheyenne in the afternoon. I have just received a telegram from Utah stating that a joint session of the house and senate to be held at the capital building in Salt Lake on Thursday evening, at which time we will be given an opportunity to present the case.</p>

<p>Duluth, Minn., Feb. 16.&#8212;Exposition representatives met a large party of leading business men at the board of trade this afternoon, and a very satisfactory and profitable conference was had. The merits of the exposition were presented in brief but effective addresses and the following resolution was unanimously adopted by the meeting:</p>
<p>Resolved, That the citizens of Duluth are heartily in favor of the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition at Omaha in 1898, and believing that it is wise for Minnesota to avail herself of this opportunity of combination with the enterprising people of other western states to show their great advance in the arts of peace and the possibilities of their future developments, we do recommend that the state of Minnesota, through its legislature now in session, take action to have this state properly represented at the exposition.</p>

<p>The reception being accorded the delegations sent out from Omaha to exploit the exposition among the legislatures of the western and northern transmississippi states is very encouraging to the directors and members of the executive committee remaining in the city. The reports coming from along the routes of these excursions are most encouraging in their nature and indicate an awakening and  an interest among the people of the entire transmississippi region which augurs exceedingly well for the enthusiastic support of the exposition from all over the great west.</p>
<p>The one thing remaining to be done to make the tour of these delegations a most pronounced success is prompt action on the part of the Nebraska legislature, and that this fact is appreciated by all the business interests in the state is shown by the multitude of petitions that are being received at Lincoln in every mail. Voluminous petitions from the central and southeastern counties this state were presented to the legislature by Clark of Richardson, chairman of the house committee of ways and means, bearing the signatures of almost every resident of those counties and asking the legislature to take prompt action and pass the exposition bill. The amounts recommended ranged from $200,000 to $350,000.</p>

<p>Secretary Wakefield has received a letter from Congressman Mercer, fixing Omaha as the place and March 4 as the date upon which the women of the Second congressional district shall assemble to elect two members of the Board of Lady Managers of the Educational department of the exposition. The secretary will issue the necessary call for this meeting in a few days. The plan under which the women's board will be organized provides, in effect, that the two members from this district shall be elected form "outside of Omaha and South Omaha." There are three counties in this congressional district, viz: Washington, Sarpy and Douglas, so that a considerable extent of territory will enter into the competition.</p>
<p>Secretary Wakefield had not heard from Representatives Andrews and Hainer at noon today regarding the places of holding mass meetings of women in their districts, and he telegraphed to those congressmen this afternoon for instructions in the matter. No replies have yet been received to the letters sent to the mayors of Fremont, Broken Bow, and Lincoln, asking them to engage halls for meetings in those towns, but arrangements have been made to hold these meetings on Wednesday of next week unless something should intervene to prevent.</p>
<p>Under the plan of organization of the women's board, a woman will be sent from Omaha to each of these mass meetings to explain the plan of woman's work in the exposition.</p>

<head type="sub">Colorado People Express a Desire to Be Represented.</head>
<p>DENVER, Feb. 17.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The Transmississippi Exposition committee now visiting the western states in the interest of that great enterprise arrived in this city yesterday and was cordially received. Arrangements had been made for a meeting in the legislative hall of the capitol, at which the committee would address the members of the general assembly in favor of an appropriation of $50,000 in order to secure a proper display from Colorado.</p>
<p>The meeting was called to order by H. P. Steele, ex-president of the Chamber of Commerce and the vice president for Colorado of the exposition, who named Lieutenant Governor Brush as the presiding officer. Before taking the chair the lieutenant governor warmly endorsed the exposition scheme, but said he feared the bill was stronger than the pocket book was full. Mayor McMurray extended a cordial welcome to the visitors and spoke in complimentary terms of the resources of Nebraska and Omaha's commercial greatness. G. M. Hitchcock of Omaha was then introduced and made a strong and convincing presentation of the claims of the exposition on Colorado and the mountain states, and pointed out the industrial advantages which would result therefrom. He read a letter from Hon. W. J. Bryan, in which the benefits of the exposition were briefly but forcibly presented. In conclusion Mr. Hitchcock made an eloquent plea for the assistance of Colorado in an enterprise that would be so advantageous to the state as well as the whole west.</p>
<p>John L. Webster followed in a similar strain and dwelt particularly on the advantage of the exposition in inducing immigration and the investment of capital. W. S. Poppleton and G. W. Wattles were the last speakers, and urged the duty of the people of Colorado to join in an enterprise in which all of the transmississippi states were so deeply interested.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the speaking an informal reception was held and the Omaha visitors presented personally to members of the general assembly. As to the effects of the meeting, no opinion can be ventured at this time. There is no disposition to antagonize the arguments in favor of the exposition, the only objection urged being the condition of the state treasury.</p></div2>

<p>LINCOLN, Feb. 18.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The attempt to advance the Transmississippi Exposition bill in the house this morning resulted in failure. Wooster of Merrick led the opposition. The Lancaster delegation, all republicans, voted bodily against the bill. Speaker Gaffin said that with sixteen bills ahead of it two weeks would elapse before it could be reached. Hull of Harlan, populist, moved to advance the bill to the head of the list on the general file. Winslow of Gosper moved an amendment to defer action on the measure until the appropriation were made. On this amendment the ayes and nays were demanded with the result of: Ayes, 36; nays, 57. The amendment was defeated. It required sixty-seven votes to advance the bill from its regular order. The votes on Hull's original motion resulted: Ayes, 55; nays 38, and the exposition bill lies buried under sixteen other measures on the general file.

<head type="sub">Mass Meetings of the Women of the Fourth and Sixth Congressional Districts Are Called&#8212;Judge Neville Goes to Arkansas.</head>
    <div3>
<p>Applications continue to be received at exposition headquarters for concessions in the way of novelties and Chief Hardt of the Department of Exhibits, who has been attached to all the great expositions of the world during the past twenty years, is authority for the statement that the Transmississippi Exposition will have a large number of attractive and instructive engineering novelties which have never been exhibited at any exposition. Applications have already been received for concessions involving daring engineering feats in their construction and several of these have been referred to at length in these columns. In some cases the promoters of these schemes advance the ideas with the purpose of having the exposition authorities erect the proposed structure, but in the majority of cases the inventors simply make application for space. The latest of these plans is developed in an application for a "marine merry-go-round." The inventor of this novel scheme of amusement proposed to erect a structure on an island in the center of a miniature lake. From this island pleasure-seekers will embark in boats made in the form of sea monsters, and these monsters, with their burden of human freight, will gambol about on the waves of the lake. For the entertainment of the timid ones who are afraid to entrust themselves to the keeping of the cavorting monsters, the inventor will provide a movable platform, somewhat in the nature of the regulation merry-go-round. The inventor of this novelty makes application for 20,000 square feet of space and says he is prepared to invest from $15,000 to $20,000 in the construction of his machine.</p>
<p>Another application, which is regarded as highly appropriate for a Nebraska man, is for sufficient space on which to erect a "Beet Sugar Palace." This application comes from Dawes county, and is from a man known to be able to carry out his idea in a creditable manner.</p></div3>

Special car No. 15, furnished by the Burlington served as a conveyance for the party and with its sides emblazoned by enormous yellow and black banners will carry the name of the great exposition for many thousands of miles before its return. Those composing the party are C. S. Montgomery, Postmaster Euclid Martin, E. J. Cornish, Rev. S. Wright Butler, Judge Cornish of Lincoln and Major Crowder.</p>
<p>The delegates will visit the legislatures of nearly all the state forming the southern section of the transmississippi region, and will speak for appropriations for state exhibits. The first stop will be at Kansas City.</p>
<p>A period of about twenty four hours will be allotted to each capital, with the exception of the City of Mexico, where three days will be passed in an endeavor to interest President Diaz in the exposition and gain his good will toward a liberal appropriation for  a Mexican exhibit. Two days will be spent at Little Rock, Ark.</p>
<p>The route as thus far laid out will comprise visits in the order named to Jefferson City, St. Louis, Little Rock, Texarkana, Fort Worth, El Paso, Austin and the City of Mexico. Upon the return trip Waco, Tex., and Guthrie, Okl., will be visited.</p>
<p>The trip will consume a period of about twenty-one days, which may possibly be prolonged according to the number of prominent people at the various stops who will have to be interviewed.</p>
<p>The car is stocked with a large quantity of advertising matter, conspicuous among which are several thousand copies of the special exposition number of The Bee. These will be distributed along the route, together with folders, plats of the location of the great show, and other interesting data. Special telegrams will be sent from time to time by members of the party to The Bee that its readers may be kept informed on the success of the southern delegates.</p>
<p>Speaker Gaffin yesterday introduced a bill in the house at Lincoln for an act to permit county agricultural societies to participate in the Transmississippi Exposition and providing for the expense of county exhibits. The measure authorizes counties to forego their annual exhibits and apply the money to an exhibit in the exposition. It is in line with the bill of Senator Schaal introduced a few days ago in the senate. Van Horn of Dodge also introduced a bill this morning, appropriating $10,000 to enable the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture to make an exhibit at the Transmississippi and International Exposition. Yeiser of Douglas introduced a measure to compel all railroad companies to erect and maintain union passenger depots where four or more roads enter the same city and to provide that the act may be enforced by mandamus.</p>

Governor Richards, nearly all of the state officers and a large number of visitors were present. The joint session was addressed by Messrs. Hitchcock, Wattles, Palmer, Webster and Poppleton, and the advantages which would accrue to Wyoming from liberal and hearty participation in the exposition fully set forth by the speakers. Mr. Webster in his speech assured the legislature that the exposition was not to be merely an Omaha or Nebraska enterprise, but one in which the entire transmississippi region was interested, and in which the entire region should enter into partnership. He predicted that its result would be to lift the entire region out of the depression which at the present time overshadows it.</p>

<p>ST. PAUL, Minn., Feb. 18.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The exposition party arrived yesterday morning from Duluth and through the kind offices of F. H. Peavy, vice president for Minnesota, and L. R. Crocker, president of the Minneapolis Board of Trade, and others were accorded a hearing before the Minnesota senate. Chairman Lindsey introduced the subject in brief remarks and was followed by Mr. Hart of Council Bluffs in a more extended address, which was cordially applauded. Many Senators declared themselves convinced of the merits of the exposition and the delegation is very well satisfied with the results accomplished. On account of pressure of other business in the house it was not considered wise to broach the subject there yesterday, but arrangements have been made for a hearing at 10 o'clock this morning. The sentiments expressed are very favorable. The delegation will also meet today the representatives of the editorial fraternity at the winter meeting of the state association. This is evidently a good opportunity to sow seed that will grow a good crop of interest in the exposition.</p>
<p>The trip to Bismarck will be delayed one day, but the delegates feel that the work to be done here is certainly worth the while, and they are very hopeful of results. Only those out in the field can understand the necessity for prompt action by the Nebraska legislature, and much depends upon the ready settlement of the question so often asked: "What is your own state going to do?" The trip so far has been productive of much good, and the indications are that Minnesota's resources will have a splendid showing at the exposition.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">VERY INDIGNANT!</head>
<head type="sub">Are the Ladies Who Took an Active Part</head>
<head type="sub">In the Trans-Mississippi Convention</head>
<head type="sub">Last Saturday&#8212;They Take Exception to</head>
<head type="sub">Sundry Remarks Made by The Tribune.</head>
<p>An "indignation" meeting was held yesterday afternoon in the office of Supt. Munro by those ladies who took an active part in the transmississippi convention Saturday, and take exception to sundry remarks which have appeared in the TRIBUNE concerning it. The brownies tried to bribe Prof. Munro into giving them a detailed statement of the meeting, but that gentleman has not been very communicative with the TRIBUNE for several months, and frost formed on his lips in reply. The bald-headed adonis then tried his persuasiveness on some of the dear creatures, but they wouldn't unfold the secret, "not for world's." Enough was gleaned to know that it was somewhat of a redhot affair, that the brownies were browned to a table d'hote hue, and that the ladies were determined to see that the world knows just how fairly the recent election was held. The TRIBUNE's invitation to the ladies to use its columns in explaining their part of the convention will be accepted perhaps, and in a day or two a scorching, blistering epistle may be given to the yearning public.</p>
<p>Having been thoroughly stirred up the ladies propose to stay that way until they know what's what. They have been holding small consultation parties in all parts of the city, some <choice><sic>aproving</sic></choice><corr>approving</corr>, others denouncing the construction placed on the proceedings of the convention by the press. The Mead forces are still loud in their vociferations that the vote was not counted square and the friends of the delightfully charming members of the teller's committee are equally confident that the whole proceedings was just as fair as a church raffle can be. What the end will be even Old Nick, does not know, but there is going to be a whole lot of fun before the curtain drops.</p>
<p>It is another development that the school teachers were not given a fair shake in the convention. Some of our most intelligent ladies are members of the instructress element and a few of them had hopes of being selected to the board of lady managers, but they immediately withdrew when warned from several authoritative sources that their positions would be jeopardized by their candidacies</p></div2>

<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
    <p>Cheyenne, Wyo., Feb. 17.&#8212;When the exposition delegation arrived in <unclear reason="torn">enne</unclear> this morning it was to find the city indulging in the luxury of a fine storm. A committee on reception from the legislature at once waded thi<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> the snow and boarded the car to welcome the delegation and inform its <unclear reason="torn">bers</unclear> that they would be received by joint session of senate and house <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> o'clock. When the hour arrived the delegation was received by Governor Richards, who accompanied the members to representative hall and occup<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> seat next to President Abbott of the senate, who presided.</p>
    <p>After the session was called to order I made a brief speech outlining scope, purposes and character of the exposition enterprise, and in closing i<unclear reason="torn">duced</unclear> Mr. Wattles, who spoke in a business-like manner, treating the expos<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> as a business investment for the west. Captain H. E. Palmer, who has <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> interests and many friends in Wyoming, was the next speaker, and after <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> came John L. Webster, who made a strong and effective appeal for the co-operation of Wyoming. This speech brought out generous applause. So also did <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> speech of Mr. W. S. Poppleton, which closed the meeting.</p>
    <p>Mr. Poppleton dwelt upon the future greatness of the west, providing states united for mutual good. At the conclusion of the speeches, which occupied about an hour, I asked the privilege of meeting the committee on <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> and means to discuss the subject in detail. This was accorded, and the <unclear reason="torn">ch</unclear> men of both senate and house committees called a meeting for this evening.</p>
    <p>At 8 o'clock our delegation met these committees and discussed the sub<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> for nearly two hours. Governor Richards was present, and being called <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>warmly <choice><sic>indorsed</sic><corr>endorsed</corr></choice> the project and said he would approve a bill even though state funds are low. Individual members of committee were outspoken in favor of a bill, and the only question is as to amount. As the session is near its <unclear reason="torn">c</unclear> the committees decided to go into executive session at once and decide on amount of the appropriation. We then withdrew feeling certain that Wyoming though a small state, would make an appropriation this week.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we shall be with the people of Utah. G. M. HITCHCOCK</p>

    <p>St. Paul, Minn., Feb. 17.&#8212;The exposition party arrived this morning f<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> Duluth, and through the kind offices of F. H. Peavey, vice president for Minnesota, and L. R. Crocker, president of the Minneapolis board of trade others, were accorded a hearing before the Minnesota senate. Chairman Lindsey introduced the subject in a few brief remarks and was followed <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> Mr. Harl of Council Bluffs in a more extended address, which was cordially applauded. Many senators declared themselves convinced of the merits of the exposition, and the delegation is very well satisfied with the results accomplished.</p>
<p>On account of the pressure of other business in the house it was not considered wise to broach the subject there today, but the arrangements have been made for a hearing at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. Sentiments pressed are very favorable.</p>
    <p>The delegation will also meet tomorrow the representatives of the <unclear reason="torn">torial</unclear> fraternity at the winter meeting of the state association. This is <unclear reason="torn">dently</unclear> a good opportunity to sow seed that will grow a good crop of interest in the exposition.</p>
    <p>The trip to Bismarck will be delayed one day, but delegates felt that work to be done here is certainly worth while and they are very hopeful <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> results. Only those out in the field can understand the necessity <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> prompt action by the Nebraska legislature, and much depends upon the <unclear reason="torn">ea</unclear> settlement of a question so often asked: What is your state going to <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> The trip so far has been productive of much good, and indications are that Minnesota's resources will have a splendid showing at the exposition.</p>

<head type="sub">Exposition Delegation From Omaha Makes an Impression Before the Legislature.</head>
<head type="sub">Committees That Wait on the Ways and Means Committees of Missouri and Minnesota Are Greatly Encouraged.</head>
<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
<p>Salt Lake City, Utah, Feb. 18.&#8212;The exposition delegation reached Salt Lake in the midst of a snow storm this afternoon, being met at Ogden by Senator Shurtliff, who is also vice president of the exposition for Utah. In compliance with the suggestion contained in the special message of Governor Wells, the legislature voted to hold a joint session this evening to listen to members of the delegation.</p>
<p>The joint session was called to order by Speaker Perkins, who presided, and after welcoming the delegation, introduced Governor Wells, who made a strong, vigorous and dignified speech in which he gave full approval to the exposition enterprise and predicted that the legislature would give the matter prompt and favorable consideration. His speech was frequently applauded and greatly pleased the members of our delegation.</p>
<p>At its conclusion I spoke on the same lines that I followed in other states and in concluding called on Clement Chase. He dwelt upon the bond of sympathy between Utah and Nebraska, because it was in Nebraska that the Mormon pioneers saw the last of civilization on their pilgrimage west. The very site of the exposition was at one time the location of a Mormon encampment.</p>
<p>The next speaker was President Wattles, who dwelt on the scope of the enterprise. John L. Webster followed in a brief, strong speech and William S. Poppleton closed the hearing in a speech which was frequently applauded and which was the best he has yet made.</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting Senator Claine offered a resolution, which was unanimously adopted, thanking us for presenting the case and assuring us that the matter would be given prompt and favorable consideration by the legislature before the session closed. Arrangements were also made to hold a meeting of the ways and means committee tomorrow morning, at which we will appear and discuss the business details of the project.</p>
<p>I have just received a message from Cheyenne, stating the committee on ways and means had recommended to the Wyoming legislature $8,000. This is small, but it is not so small as it seems for two reasons. One is that Wyoming already has collected a very valuable mineral exhibit which has cost perhaps $15,000 and which will be the nucleus for an exhibit at Omaha. Another is that they Wyoming bill will provide for additional appropriations by counties, so that Wyoming will expend at least $40,000 in making her exhibit at Omaha.</p>
<p>One of the obstacles we encounter is the reports which come from the Nebraska legislature that the enterprise is being opposed by many of our own people. Notwithstanding this obstacle, we are making rapid progress and I express the opinion of the whole delegation when I saw the west is with us.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we leave for Montana. We have met four legislatures in four days. G. M. HITCHCOCK.</p>

<p>Jefferson City, Mo., Feb. 18.&#8212;Upon our arrival at 2 p. m. we called immediately upon Governor Stephens at the capital and were received cordially. He made many inquiries, showing much interest and promised to favor a liberal appropriation and said if a bill had not already been introduced he would hand in a special message. He then went with us to representative hall and introduced us to many members and senators and arranged the meeting this evening with the joint appropriation committee, which has been successfully conducted.</p>
<p>At this meeting C. S. Montgomery stated the origin of our enterprise and its history and present condition and prospects, giving details of subscriptions, donations and appropriations and the importance of the project and especially the interest of Missouri therein.</p>
<p>Mr. E. J. Cornish then presented carefully and forcibly the especial reasons why Missouri is and should give <choice><sic>liebral</sic><corr>liberal</corr></choice> encouragement. Dr. Butler followed with one of his most attractive and persuasive speeches, the effectiveness of which was very noticeable. During the afternoon and evening Major Crowder, among his many friends, and Mr. Martin and Judge Cornish, among the legislators, put in effective work.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of our meeting we were assured by Major Bittinger, members from St. Joseph, that the members of the committee were convinced of the propriety of the appropriation and that the legislature would quite certainly vote on and that Missouri will partake satisfactorily in the big show.</p>
<p>We have been received and treated by the governor and all others most satisfactorily. We will spend tomorrow in St. Louis, where we except to do some effective work. C. S. MONTGOMERY.</p>
<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald:</ab>
<p>St. Paul, Minn., Feb. 18.&#8212;The exposition delegates met members of the house of representatives this morning and had a very cordial reception. They were introduced by Vice President F. H. Peavey of Minneapolis, who gave the enterprise his unqualified <choice><sic>indorsement</sic><corr>endorsement</corr></choice>, Chairman Lindsey spoke briefly and then introduced L. F. Crofoot of Omaha who, in a most effective address, detailed the history and scope and objects of the exposition. he was emphatically applauded, and many members personally declared themselves in favor a liberal appropriation.</p>
<p>Later the delegation appeared before the winter meeting of the State Editorial association at the Commercial club rooms, where addresses were made by I. W. Carpenter of Omaha and E. W. Caldwell of Sioux City, and the enthusiastic reception accorded them by the newspaper men is considered a very hopeful sign. The meeting unanimously adopted the following resolution:</p>
<p>"Resolved, That the Minnesota Editors and Publishers' association heartily <choice><sic>indorse</sic><corr>endorse</corr></choice> the enterprise for the Trans-Mississippi exposition at Omaha in 1898, and we earnestly hope the legislature may make adequate appropriation to insure Minnesota an effective exhibition of her agricultural, mineral and manufacturing resources and possibilities.</p>
<p>The delegation last evening had a <choice><sic>sesion</sic><corr>session</corr></choice> with the representatives of St. Paul Commercial club, and enlisted several of them in the promotion of the Minnesota exhibit at Omaha. Messrs. Lindsey, Crofoot and Caldwell go tonight to <choice><sic>Bismarc kand</sic><corr>Bismarck and</corr></choice> Carpenter goes to Owatonna to present the claims of the exposition before a meeting of the State Dairymen's association and will Saturday evening address in this city a meeting of the Manufacturers and Consumers' association.

<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
<p>Lincoln, Neb., Feb. 18.&#8212;Today may be properly called exposition day, so far as the house is concerned. All day long the exposition appropriation has been the theme of general conversation among the statesmen, their sisters, their cousins and their aunts. At one time during the day it seemed that the bill had received what might be considered a well nigh fatal blow, but it recovered before the day's session in the house closed, and tonight it is not too much to say that the exposition bill is in a better condition than it has ever been.</p>
<p>It ought to be known that a great many members who have opposed the advancement of this bill will not be inclined to vote against the bill after it shall have come up in the committee of the whole. There are certain republicans in the house who are anxious to have it appear that the fusion legislature is against this exposition measure, and these republicans have encouraged a handful of populists to aid them in fighting the bill through a mere pretense by opposing its advancements on one reason or another.</p>
<p>The fight came up in the house this morning, when Hull of Harlan, a populist, moved to advance the exposition bill to the top of the general file. The bill is now about sixteen bills down on the general file and its friends realized the necessity of prompt consideration. As soon as Hull made his motion the republican-populist tie-up heretofore exposed by the World-Herald, came in evidence.</p>
<p>Wooster of Merrick made a vigorous speech against the advancement of this bill. Pollard, the young republican member from Cass, who, while being a very ardent republican, appears to be a very strong Nebraskan, made a speech in favor of Mr. Hull's motion. Mr. Pollard said that this bill was a very important one and ought to be immediately considered. He made a strong speech in favor of Hull's motion.</p>
<p>Winslow of Frontier, populist, proposed as an amendment that the exposition bill be postponed until after all state institutions had been cared for.</p>
<p>Horner, populist of Dawson, made an earnest appeal to the members of the house to support Hull's motion. He was followed by Clark of Richardson, democrat, in the same vein.</p>
<p>Jenkins of Jefferson, republican, the gentleman who, while always opposing this bill at every opportunity, has insisted that he was favorable to the bill, made a characteristic speech against Hull's motion. Mr. Jenkins earnestly opposed taking the exposition bill out of its order. He was followed by Gaylord of Buffalo, who supported Jenkins with the same ardor he exhibited last week in opposing this measure.</p>
<p>Horner of Dawson, populist, came back at Gaylord in fine shape and renewed his plea for Hull's motion. Pollard of Cass, republican, again took the floor in behalf of the bill, and Fouke of Gage spoke in favor of taking up the bill immediately.</p>

<pb n="97" xml:id="TMISB02-097"/> 



<p>Jenkins of Jefferson, the republican obstructionist, again put in his oar against the bill, and Stebbins of Lincoln, populist, took all the cream off from Jenkins' argument. Jenkins had said in his speech that the state treasury was bankrupt and he seemed to enlarge upon this point, when Mr. Stebbins drew applause from the galleries by reminding Mr. Jenkins that if the state treasury was bankrupt that it was not the fault of the populist party. Judge Felker made a strong speech in favor of Hull's motion.</p>
<p>Hull of Harlan took the floor in behalf of his motion. <choice><sic>Te</sic><corr>He</corr></choice> stated that the fusion forces were in favor of immediate consideration of the exposition bill, and while he would not commit himself to the bill as it was introduced, he thought it due to the exposition company that the measure should be given immediate consideration.</p>
<p>Eager of Seward, populist, opposed Hull's motion and finally moved the previous question. Gaylord of Buffalo, on behalf of the enemies of the bill, demanded a call of the house. Half an hour was wasted on this order and finally the roll was called on Winslow's amendment to postpone the bill, and that amendment was defeated by thirty-six yeas to fifty-seven nays. Then the original motion to put the exposition bill at the head of the general file, was voted on.</p>
<p>The roll was called, and the vote stood <choice><sic>figty-five</sic><corr>fifty-five</corr></choice> yeas to thirty-eight nays. The speaker ruled that it was necessary to have sixty-seven votes in the affirmative, two-thirds vote, to take the bill out of its regular order. He, therefore, ruled that the motion was lost. The vote on Winslow's amendment was as follows:</p>
<p>Yeas&#8212;Messrs. Alderman, Ankeny, Bernard, Billings, Burkett, Campbell, Chittenden, Clark of Lancaster, Cole, Eager, Eastman, Eighmy, Fernow, Gaylord, Goshorn, Henderson, Hile, Hill, Jenkins, Jones of Gage, Keister, Mann, Mills, Mitchell, Rouse, Sever, Snyder of Johnson, Soderman, Sutton, Uerling, Van Horn, Waite, Webb, Wimberly, Winslow, Wooster,&#8212;Total, 36.</p>
<p>Nays&#8212;Messrs. Baldwin, Blake, Bower, Byram, Casebeer, Clark of Richardson, Cronk, Endorf, Felker, Fouke, Gerdes, Givens, Grandstaff, Grell, Grimes, Grosvenor, Hamilton, Holbrook, Holland, Horner, Hull, Hyatt, Jones of Nemaha, Jones of Wayne, Kapp, Lamar, Lindell, Loomis, McCarthy, McCracken, McGee, McLeod, Marshall, Moran, Morrison, Nesbit, Phelps, Pollard, Prince, Rich, Roberts, Robertson, Sheldon, Shull, Smith of Douglas, Smith of Richardson, Snyder of Sherman, Stebbins, Taylor of Douglas, Taylor of Fillmore, Welch, Wheeler, Woodard, Wright, Yeiser, Young, Zimmerman, Mr. Speaker&#8212;Total 57.</p>
<p>The vote on Hull's original motion to advance the exposition bill was as follows:</p>
<p>Yeas&#8212;Messrs. Baldwin, Blake, Bower, Byram, Clark of Richardson, Cronk, Endorf, Felker, Fonke, Gerdes, Givens, Grandstaff, Grell, Grimes, Grosvenor, Hamilton, Henderson, Holbrook, Holland, Horner, Hull, Hyatt, Jones of Nemaha, Jones of Wayne, Knapp, Lemar, Liddell, Loomis, McGee, McLeod, Mann., Marshall, Moran, Morrison, Nesbit, Pollard, Prince, Rich, Roberts, Robertson, Snyder of Sherman, Stebbins, Taylor of Douglas, Taylor of Fillmore, Welch, Wheeler, Wimberly, Woodard, Yelser, Young, Zimmerman, Mr. Speaker, Total, 55.</p>
<p>Nays&#8212;Messrs. Alderman, Ankeny, Bernard, Billings, Burkett, Campbell, Casebeer, Chittenden, Clark of Lancaster, Cole, Eager, Eastman, Eighmy, Fernow, Gaylord, Goshorn, Hile, Hill, Jenkins, Jones of Gage, Keister, McCarthy, McCracken, Mills, Mitchell, Phelps, Rouse, Severe, Smith of Richardson, Snyder, Sonderman, Sutton, Uerling, Van Horn, Waite, Webb, Winslow, Wooster.&#8212;Total, 28.</p>
<p>The friends of the bill appeared to be gratified that they were able to get so large an affirmative vote, but the enemies of the bill congratulated themselves very lustily upon the speaker's ruling. At 4 o'clock, however, the speaker announced that he thought he had made a mistake on his ruling on the <choice><sic>xeposition</sic><corr>exposition</corr></choice> bill and unless some member would present good reasons to the contrary he would hold that the exposition bill was at the top of the general file because it had received the constitutional majority.</p>
<p>This created considerable stir and the enemies of the bill rushed to attack the speaker's ruling. The speaker said that while he believed he was right, that he did not desire to be arbitrary in the matter. The result was, after considerable argument the committee on rules, of which the speaker is chairman, was instructed to consider the question as to whether a majority or two-thirds ruled in this legislature.</p>
<p>In the house caucus tonight the fusion members of the committee on rules were, by resolution introduced by Smith of Douglas, requested to recommend a rule providing that a majority vote shall control all things before the house. At this writing the exposition bill, though having some very vigorous opponents and being surrounded by some very unfortunate circumstances, stands an excellent chance of being enacted into law. There is no need of disguising the fact that there is a bitter fight against the exposition bill, but men who are well qualified to judge express the opinion that whenever the house shall consider this bill in committee of the whole that the result will be a recommendation for an appropriation for $200,000 <unclear reason="torn"></unclear></p>
<p>An exciting feature of the house caucus of the majority was the tilt between Wooster of Merrick and Stubbins of Lincoln. While the question of the adoption of the resolution of Smith of Douglas was under discussion Stebbings used ordinary Anglo-Saxon in telling Wooster that his assumption that he could dictate to the populists and democrats was entirely without foundation. Stebbins walked up to Wooster, and pointing his finger in his direction said: "No tin-horn can control this party, and that had just as well be understood right now."</p></div2>

<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
<p>Lincoln, Neb., Feb. 18.&#8212;At 10 o'clock this morning the Trans-Mississippi exposition bill came up in the house by a motion made by Hull of Harlan, populist, to advance the bill to the first place on general file. There are about sixteen bills ahead of the exposition bill, and the adoption of Hull's motion would have brought the exposition bill up for consideration before any other bill.</p>
<p>Winslow, populist, moved to amend by providing that the exposition bill should not be considered until after all the state appropriations were made.</p>
<p>Winslow's amendment was defeated by a vote of thirty-six yeas to fifty-seven nays.</p>
<p>After repeated argument the motion to place the bill at the top of the general file was defeated by a vote of fifty-five yeas to thirty-eight nays, the chair ruling that a two-thirds vote was necessary to adopt the bill.</p>
<p>Thus the exposition bill has been given another backset by the "entente cordial" between certain republicans and certain populists.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">SPEAKER GAFFIN'S NEW RULE</head>
<head type="sub">WILL ADVANCE THE EXPOSITION BILL</head>
<head type="sub">Difficulties that Beset the Measure Removed by the Application of Majority Control&#8212;Substitute Measure Ready for Adoption.</head>
    <div3>
<p>LINCOLN, Feb. 19.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;A second attempt was made in the house yesterday morning to advance the Transmississippi Exposition bill to the head of the general file. As before, the attempt failed, although the vote in favor of advancing the bill stood 55 to 38. Under the procedure of the house it has always required 67 votes to advance a bill ahead of its regular place on general file, and the friends of the measure were just twelve votes short of that number this morning. Late yesterday afternoon, however, an entirely new phase was added to the situation by Speaker Gaffin, who announced that after a careful study of parliamentary authorities he had reached the conclusion that a majority of the members elected to the house was sufficient to advance any bill. This new and, by the opponents of the exposition bill, unexpected ruling of the speaker, came like a bombshell into the camp of the men who have been keeping the bill back in order to advance their own measures. On the other hand it was welcomed and sustained by the men who desire that speedy action may be taken on the exposition bill in order that the promoters of the great enterprise may not longer be placed at a disadvantage in other transmississippi states. The ruling was referred to the committee on rules for early report.</p>
<p>The attempt to advance the bill this morning failed, not because the enterprise lacked friends in the house, but simply because a combination of those opposed to the project with those who were not ready to vote prevented immediate action. Under the usual procedure of the house it required 67 votes to advance the bill to the general file. The men who attempted to so advance the bill mustered but fifty-five votes. The affirmative votes were contributed by forty-three fusionists and twelve republicans, while the negative represented twenty-three fusionists and fifteen republicans.</p></div3>
<div3>
    <head type="sub">POPULISTS LEAD FOR THE BILL.</head>
<p>The attempt to advance the bill was made by the populist friends of the measure. The motion to advance the bill was made by Representative Hull of Harlan county, one of the acknowledged leaders of the populist party. He was seconded by Representative Pollard of Cass, one of the republican leaders. The debate was spirited. Among the populists who favored immediate action were Hull of Harlan, Clarke of Richardson, Horner of Dawson and Stebbins of Lincoln. The republicans favoring speedy action were Pollard of Cass and Fouke of Gage. The populists who spoke against the motion to advance were Wooster of Merrick, Winslow of Gosper and Gaylord of Buffalo. For the republicans the opposition was led by Jenkins of Jefferson.</p>
<p>At the caucus held last evening a resolution offered by Roberts of Douglas, instructing the committee on rules to report a rule providing that fifty-one votes are sufficient to advance a bill, was declared carried.</p>
<p>At a conference of free silver leaders from different parts of the state held at the Lincoln hotel Wednesday it was <choice><sic>agred</sic><corr>agreed</corr></choice> that the best interests of the Exposition enterprise could be subserved by the substitution of an entirely new bill, which would meet the objections urged by a number of members of the house to the original bill. Congressman-elect W. L. Stark of Aurora and Judge C. R. Scott of Omaha were appointed a committee to draft the proposed new bill, and they completed their labors at an early hour yesterday. The new bill will be offered to the house in committee of the whole by Speaker Gaffin. The bill will be introduced in this manner in order that no time may be lost. If it should be introduced as an entirely new bill it would have to be read twice on two different days, referred to a standing committee and then when reported back to the house, placed at the foot of the general file. In order to obviate this delay the bill will not be presented until the house goes into committee of the whole to consider the Exposition bill. Then Speaker Gaffin will move to strike out all after the enacting clause of the old bill and to substitute the new one.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">TEXT OF THE NEW BILL.</head>
<p>The new bill, as prepared by Congressman Stark and Judge Scott, is as follows:</p>

<p>Sec. 4. That for the purpose of assisting the state of Nebraska to make a proper state exhibit in said Transmississippi and International Exposition, to properly plan, advertise, carry on, develop and complete the said state exhibit in said exposition and the erection of a suitable building therefor and for the purpose of paying the salaries of each of the members of said board appointed by the governor, to pay the salaries of all superintendents, managers and employes, together with all other expenses which in the opinion of said board may be necessary to carry out the purposes of Nebraska's representation at this exposition, the sum of $200,000 be and the same is hereby appropriated from the state treasury out of any fund not otherwise appropriated.</p>

<head type="sub">VOTE ON THE MAIN QUESTION.</head>
<p>On the announcement of this result Wooster raised the point, which was against himself, that the vote on the amendment carried the whole question with it, and left the matter still open to debate. He proceeded to read from "Roberts' Rules of Order" to this effect. Jenkins went up to the speaker and the two consulted. The speaker then declared that the original motion, to advance the bill to the head of the general file, was still pending and that sixty-seven votes would be necessary to move it up. On this the yeas and nays were again demanded, with the result of 55 yeas to 38 nays, Casebeer and Henderson changing their votes and going with the opposition to advancing the measure. Otherwise the vote was the same as above. </p></div3></div2>

<head type="sub">Populists Caucus and Agree to Properly Amend the Rules.</head>
<p>LINCOLN, Feb. 19,&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The populists held a caucus at the Lincoln hotel to discuss the speaker's ruling that fifty-one votes were sufficient to advance a bill on general file. The result was the adoption of a resolution instructing the committee on rules to report such a rule to the house. The exposition bill was constantly under fire, Wooster of Merrick and Gaylord of Buffalo hammering at every turn of the discussion. Nothing occurred in the caucus, however, to indicate the result of the final ballot on the exposition bill.</p>
<p>A committee representing the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben, consisting of H. J. Penfold, W. R. Bennett, Oscar Kiplinger, W. S. Jardine and Vance Lane, appeared before the caucus and extended an invitation to the legislature to visit Omaha next Monday night. The plan was to entertain the legislators at Samson's Den with a special initiatory service. The invitation was accepted almost unanimously, John O. Yeiser alone voting no. Yeiser stated in explanation of his vote that he had been a resident of Omaha a long time and had never been invited to join the Ak-Sar-Bens or the Commercial club. The legislature will leave Lincoln next Monday at 6 o'clock. Arriving at Omaha a special train of motor cars will convey them to the Den on North Twentieth street. After the evening's entertainment the members will return to Lincoln by special train.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">DISCUSSION OF THE NEW EXPOSITION BILL</head>
<head type="sub">Regard the Provision for a Separate Board as a Most Satisfactory Arrangement&#8212;Mass Meetings Called.</head>
<p>The members of the executive committee of the exposition association who are in the city express themselves as well pleased with the prospect of speedy action on the bill pending in the Nebraska legislature. They regard the provision for a separate board to control the entire state appropriation as a satisfactory arrangement in the hands of Governor Holcomb, although they say that such a provision might be highly objectionable under some circumstances. They regard immediate action as the most important thing at this time and express a belief that harmony of action will result from any appointments the governor may make.</p>
<p>The consensus of opinion as expressed on the street is to the effect that the latest move is simply one of politics, and regret is expressed in some quarters that the bill should be made a political matter when the promoters of the exposition have used every endeavor to keep politics from entering into it in any form. Confidence, however is expressed in the fairness and wisdom of the governor, and it is believed that he will make such appointments as will result in harmonious action between the Exposition board and the state commission.</p>
<ab>WOMEN HOLD MASS MEETINGS.</ab>
<p>Secretary Wakefield has heard from the mayors of Lincoln and Fremont regarding halls for the mass meetings of women to elect members of the Board of Lady Managers, and calls have been issued for meetings at both places.</p>
<p>The women of the First congressional district will assemble in the Grand Army of the Republic hall in Lincoln at 2 p. m. Wednesday, February 24, for the purpose of electing two women from that district to serve as members of the Board of Lady Managers.</p>
<p>The women of the Third congressional district will assemble in the Masonic hall in Fremont at 10:30 a. m. Wednesday, February 24, to elect two members of the Board of Lady Managers. The time for the meeting in Fremont is fixed at 10:30 a. m. for the reason that the trains into that city arrive about 10 a. m., and the outgoing trains depart about 3 o'clock, and the attendants at the meeting will thus be enabled to reach their homes during the daytime.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">North Side Improvement Club Discusses Pertinent Subjects.</head>
<p>The North Side Improvement club held a meeting at Erfling's hall last night. There was a good attendance of residents of the northern portion of the city and several matters of immediate interest to the north side were discussed.</p>
<p>The first business transacted by the meeting was the passage of a resolution expressing the thanks of the club to Messrs. R. W. Richardson, D. H. Christie, J. Y. Craig, G. F. Shepherd and F. W. Parker for their untiring efforts to secure the location of the exposition at Miller park.</p>
<p>Mr. Craig, for the committee appointed at the last meeting to wait upon the county commissioners and ask that body to co-operation in placing the roads in the northern part of the city and county in good condition, reported that the commissioners had expressed a willingness to do all in their power to assist the exposition in every way.</p>
<p>A resolution offered by W. A. Saunders expressed the thanks and appreciation of the club to the directors of the exposition for locating the exposition in Miller park, and closed by tendering to the officers and directors the assistance of the club in any way calculated to promote the interests of the affair. This resolution was unanimously adopted.</p>
<p>President Richardson left the chair long enough to introduce a resolution providing for the appointment of a committee of five to wait on the park board and the committee on streets and alleys of the city council and endeavor to have the Nineteenth street boulevard placed in first-class condition from end to end. This resolution was adopted after the matter had been thoroughly discussed, and the chair appointed W. A. Saunders, George Bassett, W. H. Gates, E. Benedict and J. Y. Craig as the committee.</p>
<p>A motion by George W. Holbrook was also passed, instructing the secretary of the club to request the chief of police to enforce the ordinance prohibiting heavy traffic on the boulevards of the city. Mr. Holbrook stated that these streets are being destroyed by wagons loaded with coal and other heavy material.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Promise of a Show at the Omaha Exposition Enthusiastically Given.</head>
<p>ST. PAUL, Minn., Feb. 19.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The exposition delegates met the members of the house of representatives yesterday morning and had a very cordial reception. They were introduced by Vice President F. H. Peavey of Minneapolis, who gave the enterprise his unqualified endorsement. Chairman Lindsey spoke briefly and then introduced L. F. Crofoot of Omaha, who, in a most effective address, detailed the history, scope and objects of the exposition. He was emphatically applauded, and many members personally declared themselves in favor of a liberal appropriation.</p>
<p>Later the delegation appeared before the winter meeting of the State Editorial association at the Commercial club rooms, where addresses were made by I. W. Carpenter of Omaha and E. W. Caldwell of Sioux City, and the enthusiastic reception accorded them by the newspaper men is considered a very hopeful sign. The meeting unanimously adopted the following resolution:</p>
<p>Resolved, That the Minnesota Editors' and Publishers association heartily endorses the enterprise for the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha in 1898, and we earnestly hope the legislature may make an adequate appropriation to insure Minnesota an effective exhibition of our agricultural, mineral and manufacturing resources and possibilities.</p>
<p>The delegation last evening had a session with representatives of the St. Paul Commercial club and enlisted several of them in the promotion of the Minnesota exhibit at Omaha.</p>
<p>Messrs. Lindsey, Crofoot and Caldwell go to Bismarck and Carpenter goes to Owatonna to present the claims of the exposition before the meeting of the State Dairymen's association and will, on Saturday evening, address in this city a meeting of the Manufacturers' and Consumers' association. The delegation is thoroughly satisfied with the outlook as it has developed during the visit.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Missionaries Do Excellent Work While at Jefferson City.</head>
<p>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., Feb. 19.&#8212;Special Telegram.)&#8212;Upon its arrival here at 2 p. m. yesterday the Transmississippi Exposition delegation immediately called upon Governor Stephens at the capitol and was received cordially. He made many inquiries, showing much interest, and promised to favor a liberal appropriation, and said if a bill had not already been introduced he would hand in a special message. He then went with the delegates to representative hall and introduced them to many members and senators and arranged the meeting last evening with the joint appropriation committee, which has been successfully conducted.</p>
<p>At this meeting C. S. Montgomery stated the origin of the enterprise and its history and presented the conditions and prospects, giving details of subscriptions, donations and appropriations and the importance of the project, and especially the interest of Missouri therein. E. J. Cornish then presented carefully and forcibly the especial reasons why Missouri is interested and should give liberal encouragement. Dr. Butler followed with one of his most attractive and persuasive speeches, the effectiveness of which was very noticeable.</p>
<p>During the afternoon and evening Major Crowder, among his many friends, and Mr. Martin and Judge Cornish, among the legislators, put in effective work. At the conclusion of the meeting the delegates were assured by Major Bittinger, member from St. Joseph, that the members of the committee were convinced of the propriety of the appropriation and that the legislature would quite certainly vote one and that Missouri will partake satisfactorily in the big show.</p>
<p>The delegates are well pleased with the manner in which they have been received and treated by the governor and all others. They will spend today in St. Louis, where they expect to do some effective work.</p></div2>

Fremont has several women who have been mentioned for the positions and who would be valuable and efficient members, but none are reported as active candidates for the place. The people here are taking a renewed interest in the exposition and the general opinion is that the state at large and this section in particular will derive enough benefit from it to warrant the voting of a liberal appropriation by the legislature.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Committee of Directors Addresses the Legislative Joint Session.</head>
<p>SALT LAKE CITY, Utah, Feb. 19.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;A special joint session of both houses of the Utah legislature was held last evening in order to afford the Transmississippi Exposition delegates an opportunity to be heard. All of the members attended and gave the closest attention to the speeches of the Omaha visitors. As a result of the eloquent and convincing arguments it is certain that the legislature will make an appropriation, probably ranging from $10,000 to $50,000.</p>
<p>Governor Wells was present at the joint session and delivered a brief address of welcome to the visitors. "As to the great undertaking that they represent," said he, "I think it high time that the states on this side of the Mississippi river made a showing. When the man who is holding the highest position in the United States points his pudgy finger to the west and characterizes the states of the west as undesirable states the time has come for a show-down. Utah ought to be represented at that exposition. Our first duty is to our semi-centennial celebration, but something can be spared for the Omaha Exposition and in the inspiring language of an old democrat, 'I am for the old flag and an appropriation.'"</p>
<p>Forcible and convincing arguments were then made by President Gurdon W. Wattles, G. M. Hitchcock, W. S. Poppleton and Clement Chase. They described the scope of the exposition in an entertaining manner and spoke of the advantages that would accrue to the west. Their tributes to Brigham Young and the Mormon pioneers were applauded, as four-fifths of the members of the legislature are Mormons. Mr. Poppleton's announcement that the exposition auditorium would be modeled after the Mormon tabernacle was received with great enthusiasm. The delegates will meet with the ways and means committees of both houses today and leave for Helena this evening.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="main">Exposition Endorsements</head>
<head type="sub">BY THE TRANSMISSISSIPPI PRESS.</head>
<p>Gunnison (Colo.) News: The Colorado legislature is being urged to pass an appropriation for a state exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition next year. It is to be hoped it will see its way clear to do so, as the exposition will without doubt do more to advertise the west than all the work of the last ten years. Pass the appropriation. It will be the best investment of the year.</p>
<p>American Red Men (Des Moines, Ia.): The Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha, Neb., is the biggest advertisement that has ever been attempted for the Mississippi valley and the states beyond the Rockies. It is not a visionary, sky-rocket scheme, but a well-planned and well-matured effort to give the widest possible publicity to the advantages offered in this section to capitalists and homeseekers who have money with which to buy land and engage in instrumental enterprises. The Atlanta Cotton States exposition turned the tide of immigration and capital from the west to the south. The aim of the exposition of 1898 is to set forth the advantages and limitless resources of states west of the Mississippi and thus attract homeseekers and investors.</p>
<p>A moderate estimate places the number of people who will visit the fair at from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000. This vast stream of humanity will come chiefly from the population centers. Thousands upon thousands will pass beyond Omaha to the Rockies and the Pacific coast. It is safe to compute that the fair will bring about the circulation of $100,000,000 in the transmississippi country, which will be expended for transportation, in the purchase of supplies and permanent investments.</p>
<p>Galveston (Tex.) Tribune: Reports from Omaha are to the effect that several transmississippi states have already made appropriations for the exhibition to be held there in 1898. The Department of Publicity estimates a population of 10,000,000 in the tributary section, and this holds out the prospect of a good attendance.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that the Texas constitution prevents a state appropriation for such purposes, but there is no reason why individual communities may not raise funds for community exhibits. Galveston especially ought to be becomingly represented at Omaha. The country from which its attractions and visitors will be drawn is the country whose products this port solicits and whose imports it hopes to supply. The exposition will afford such an occasion for Galveston and the west to get together as could not otherwise be devised. Later along in the year the commercial organizations should take the matter in hand.</p>
<p>Ames (Ia.) Times: The Transmississippi Exposition, which opens in Omaha in June, 1898, promises to be the greatest exposition ever held in this country, aside from the world's fair. Iowa is interested in this exposition, and should make a display there commensurate with her wonderful resources.</p>
<p>Florence (Ore.) West: Arrangements are now in progress with a view of holding a Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha next year. This will afford a splendid opportunity for all the states west of the Mississippi to advertise their products of all kinds and if this is judiciously done, many of the most desirable class of citizens will be attracted to the new portions of the country. The history of the different expositions that have been held in the United States shows that every one of them has helped to call attention to the advantages of those states that arranged for an attractive exhibit of their products. Arousing interest in a place is the first step toward attracting settlers. Many people who visit the expositions and see the products of a section of a country determine to visit that place and very often make a permanent home there. Oregon has plenty of room for many times its present number of inhabitants. And money spent to aid the exposition would probably pay good returns on the original investment by attracting settlers and capital to our state. In many ways and for cogent reasons it will be of a broadly national importance. In the resources and development of the transmississippi states we have an empire and a prophecy. A region that in the memory of man was a solitude and a wilderness, the haunt of the bison and the camping ground of the savage has now its magnificent cities, its network of railways, its teeming industries and its millions of population. In its mineral treasures we have sources of untold wealth, and in its fields the granary of the world. In what it has of industrial and commercial possibilities, and of area on which the wave of immigration has not yet spent itself, we have an unprecedented opportunity for enterprise and a prosperous outlet for congested populations. In the structure of western empire it is a tireless architect and a busy builder, and cannot fail in being a potent force in shaping the destinies of the nation of which it is so magnificent a part. From such a standpoint both retrospective and prospective the proposed exposition is in keeping with the situation. Nor should it be overlooked that in the composition of its population we have a mingling of the best races and blood of the world. In the new kinship they have not altogether ignored the older family ties. They are living threads in the woof of nations not easily broken. The welfare of one branch of the family is not unknown to the other. They are mutual in interest, if not in location or benefits; and we are of the opinion that in the way of advertising the resources and possibilities of the transmississippi states we have neither lithographer or artist that can be so effective in a world wide sense, as an exhibit would be such as is being formulated. The history of expositions of this character is in forceful evidence of their values. The south has been better known since what it is and what it may be were graven on the gates of Atlanta. The response has been felt in a renewal of industrial life, an influx of population and the inauguration of a new era. What the Centennial and the Columbian expositions did for the nation as a whole can never be computed, and it may be said in a general way that expositions rightly timed, placed and managed are among the most potent of modern methods in advertising the resources, progress and possibilities of a country. The Transmississippi Exposition of 1898 cannot fail to be of corresponding value not only to all tributary states, but to the nation at large. No encouragement should be denied so auspicious and important a project.</p>
<p>Denver Post: The idea is to get the legislatures of these various states sufficiently interest to make appropriations for handsome displays at the exposition, which will be devoted mainly to the transmississippi section. It is expected that Nebraska itself will devote a quarter of a million dollars to this purpose. The entire west is interested in making a success of this enterprise, and Colorado will not be behind any of its neighbors in making a display which will not only be satisfactory to the pride of the people, but one which in a comparative way will show up to our decided advantage.</p>
<p>Germania (Ia.) Standard: The Transmississippi Exposition is the biggest advertisement that has ever been attempted for the Mississippi valley and the states beyond the Rockies. The aim of the exposition of 1898 is to set forth the advantages and limitless resources of states west of the Mississippi and thus attract homeseekers and investors.</p>
<p>Omaha is making arrangements on a large scale for the exposition. The Bee is full of able articles showing the advantages of the west, the millions of hidden wealth, the undeveloped resources and the possibilities of drawing immigration from the thickly populated east. The exposition will doubtless be a success financially and otherwise.</p>
<p>Colorado Springs (Colo.) Telegraph: Omaha is making great preparations for the proposed Transmississippi Exposition to be held in that city, the metropolis of Nebraska, from June to November, in 1898. The exposition corporation will have a capital of $1,000,000, and the national government will contribute liberal displays, making it the best representation of national resources ever shown, except at the Columbian exposition, and the only exposition of the kind ever made west of the Mississippi. In the appropriation bill just reported to congress there is a provision of $200,000 for a government exhibit, and all the states west of the "Father of Waters" are expected to contribute in the way of individual displays.</p>
<p>The plan for the exposition is a scheme for the publicity and promotion of the great western interests. It is estimated that visitors to the exposition will number from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000, and the enterprise is expected to induce the circulation of $100,000,000 in the Transmississippi country.</p>
<p>While few expositions have in themselves been pecuniarily profitable, they have in all cases been of great direct benefit to the cities and states which foster them. The exertion of energy necessary in the work of preparation for such a display is sufficient to add immensely to the wealth and prosperity of any place. From the Transmississippi Exposition the city of Omaha and the state of Nebraska will reap the largest benefits, as they properly should, but all parts of the country that are represented there will be well repaid for the outlay involved.</p>
<p>Colorado should lend a hand to make the exposition a great success in very way. Outside of Nebraska there is no state that will profit more from the enterprise than Colorado. This state is the great objective point of all tourists. It is safe to say that one-half of the people who visit the Omaha exposition from the east will extend their visit to the golden state of Colorado. Low rates will be made to make this possible and the state will be overrun with tourists. A proper exhibit from this state would increase the flood of pleasure and sightseers. Next to having an exposition in Denver, no expenditure of the state along this line would be a better investment than in the Omaha exposition. The legislature had turned the proposition down, but we hope it will reopen it. The people of this city, through their various organizations, should urge upon the members of the legislature from this county an appropriation for a state exhibit at the Omaha exposition.</p>
<p>Boise, Idaho, Statesman: The Statesman has no figures showing how much money would be needed to enable the state to make a creditable display at the Omaha exposition, but it is satisfied that every effort and all needed sacrifices should be made to have an exhibit sent that will do the state credit.</p>
<p>Every one who has given the subject attention knows that the fair at Omaha is to be distinctly an advertisement for the western states. All will be represented and all will strive to make as good a showing as possible. Those who attend the exposition will be largely such as are looking for new fields, and those states that make the most favorable impression will draw the larger portion of the immigration resulting from the interstate rivalry.</p>
<p>That Idaho cannot afford to hold back at such a time must be apparent to every one. Our state can make a display that will attract attention over all others, and the result will be that we will be enormously benefited if we have an exhibit there that shall at all times properly portray our resources and advantages.</p>
<p>The problem is one that the legislature is called upon to deal with and it should take hold of the matter in the broadest spirit of statesmanship.</p>
<p>Prescott (Ariz.) Pick and Drill: Editor Rosewater of The Omaha Bee is just now doing excellent work as manager of the Department of Publicity of the Transmississippi and International Exposition. This exposition will be held at the city of Omaha, Neb., during the year 1898, at which it is proposed to focalize public attention upon the unsurpassed resources and great capabilities of the transmississippi states and territories. Such an exposition as the one proposed and held at a place so opportunely situated as Omaha is certain to become educational in its results, in that the east will have an object lesson, teaching them that there is much lying outside the Atlantic states, of which hitherto they have been so profoundly ignorant.</p>
<p>Idaho Falls (Idaho) Register: Mr. Waters has introduced a bill in the house providing for an appropriation of $30,000 and the appointment of a board of five trustees to provide for the erection of a state building and the display of the advantages of the state. It is an admitted fact that Idaho has no money for any foolish expenditures. She has no money to throw at the birds. The building up of a state is done by showing up its resources; by inviting men of capital to come and take advantage of them, to invest this money where it will return them a good interest; but people do not always come upon an invitation, they must be shown something tangible, they are not willing to take the statement of a newspaper, circular, or advertising pamphlet, unless corroborated by an exhibition of something that will be more convincing. </p>
<p>The legislature was elected on a platform of retrenchment and economy. There is, however, a vast different between economy and penuriousness. A man or a state may use economy in expending a large amount of money, if it is expended a large amount of money, if it is expended where it will result in bringing good returns, where it is bread cast upon the waters it is true economy. While the withholding of such expenditure may be of much more detriment than the saving amounts to. This is a matter into which politics should not enter&#8212;it is a matter that every man who pays a dollar tax in the state is interested in, and should be in favor of. An appropriation of $30,000 is an average of about $1,400 to each county, and we doubt if there is a county in the state, if the money is spent judiciously that would not receive more than that amount of benefit within a very short time. It will be a home institution and from the appropriations that have been made by the state of Nebraska, the city of Omaha, the railroads, the national government,and the preparations that are being made it will be a magnificent affair. The Register hopes the legislature will drop partisanship in connection with this bill and look to the interests of the state, and take such action as will redound to the welfare of the states and its enterprising people.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">ATTRACTS MUCH ATTENTION</head>
<head type="sub">EASTERN PRESS BOOMS THE EXPOSITION</head>
<head type="sub">Devotes Much Space to Detailing the Plans and Scope of the Great Transmississippi Show of 1898.</head>
<p>The Transmississippi Exposition is attracting widespread attention in the east and the great metropolitan dailies are devoting considerable space to exploiting the great affair. The most elaborate and extensive notice which has so far been given the exposition by outside papers was that contained in the Buffalo Express of last Sunday. The first part of that issue of the Express was a handsomely illustrated, eight-page paper, printed on a fine quality of paper, and the illustration are in what are known to the trade as "half tones." The latter press was well nigh perfect and the full page devoted to the great exposition was liberally interspersed with cuts. There were cuts of the city hall in Omaha, the new federal building, the court house, the proposed silver palace, a scene from Hanscom park and photographs of President Wattles and Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity. The reading matter consisted of a concise statement of the origin and progress of the exposition movement, the plans and scope of the great affair and an exhaustive statement of the resources of the transmississippi region, concluding with a history of Omaha and a pen picture of the city as it appears today.</p>
<p>A number of copies of the Express have been received in this city and they have been posted in the prominent store windows of the city by the recipients and each one forms the center of admiring groups of passersby on the street.</p>
<p>The exposition is also being liberally advertised by the newspapers in the cities visited by the several parties of promoters now touring the transmississippi states exploiting the exposition and appearing before the various legislatures. Nearly all of the papers in the cities in which stops are made devote one or more columns each day to accounts of the work of the parties an the conference with members of the legislatures and with business organization so that the people of those states are receiving abundant information regarding the matter.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">SPECIAL ORDER FOR TUESDAY.</head>
<head type="sub">Legislature Fixes a Date for Consideration of Exposition Bill.</head>
<p>A special telegram to The Bee from Lincoln says: "The vote on making the exposition bill a special order for Tuesday next was quite gratifying to the friends of the measure in the house. It indicates a change of sentiment that augurs favorably for the success of the bill. At noon Speaker Gaffin was doubtful if the bill could be made a special order and the vote of $5 to 2 was as much a surprise to the friends as it was to the active opponents of the measure. But it is a fact that many members have been won over to the bill by quiet, but effective, work during the past forty-eight hours. This afternoon a large number of petitions favoring a liberal appropriation were read by the chief clerk. They came from all parts of the state. One came from Silver Creek, the home of the bill's most active enemy, Charles Wooster. Members of the house are hearing from the citizens of the states. The are becoming convinced that there is an earnest, non-partisan demand that the great state of Nebraska shall not suffer in the estimation of her sister states from a failure to grasp the opportunity now offered of doing justice to her resources at the exposition by a display equal to that of any other state. Undoubtedly Tuesday will find the bill stronger in the house than it has been at any time since its introduction, for it is gaining friends daily."</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Merchants' Exchange Enlists to Aid the Legislature of Missouri.</head>
<p>ST. LOUIS, Feb. 20.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Soon after arrival here the exposition delegation met Charles L. Harris, formerly at Omaha with the Woodman Linseed Oil company. He undertook to aid the visitors and accordingly, with the assistance of Mr. Clark Sampson, a prominent merchant and capitalist, (and probably next mayor of St. Louis), a meeting was arranged at the Merchants' Exchange with Governor Stannard and Mr. Landenberg, president of the exchange. These gentlemen received the delegate and introduced them upon the floor to a large number of leading men of various interests.</p>
<p>At 1 o'clock the president called the board to order and Dr. Butler and Mr. Montgomery made short addresses to the more than 100 members present. The addresses were attentively and enthusiastically received, and afterwards much conversation ensued with the whole party touching the exposition. President Landenberg agreed to lay the matter before the directors of the exchange and urge them to memorialize the legislature in favor of a large appropriation. Secretary Morgan undertook to distribute documents, and the reporters present promised full accounts in the local papers tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>After the meeting the visitors were delightfully entertained at the Mercantile club at luncheon by Messrs. Harris and Sampson, who proffered their active aid in every possible way. The Omaha Commercial club and interests should immediately urge like interests here to influence proper action by the Missouri legislature.</p></div2>

The two houses met in joint session to hear the case presented by the delegates, and the greatest enthusiasm prevailed.</p>
<p>Addresses were made by Chairman Lindsey and L. F. Crofoot on the part of the exposition organization and by A. L.

<p>A joint committee of senate and house was appointed to consider matters and at once went to work. Prospects are excellent for a liberal appropriation and North Dakota may be relied upon to have a fine state display at the exposition.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="main">Exposition Endorsements</head>
<head type="sub">BY THE GERMAN PRESS.</head>
<p>Davenport (Ia.) Reform: With extraordinary energy and not less ability the projected exposition in Omaha of 1898 is being boomed. In Mr. Rosewater the exposition has a "staff trumpeter" the like of which could not be found in the whole country. It is eminently proper that Omaha should arrange for a great exposition to which the whole world is to be invited. Only by a visit to Nebraska's metropolis can people of other states learn that far out on the western banks of the Missouri river something else maybe found than starving farmers. It will be a great benefit to the whole land, when the good people from other parts of this country visit the west to see it as it really is, and not as the mischief makers have painted it.</p>
<p>Chicago Illinois Staats-Zeitung: During the summer of next year an exposition will be held in Omaha of all the states and territories west of the Mississippi river, which undoubtedly will turn out to be a great thing. The main feature of this exposition will be a silver palace. Not a palace entirely built of silver, but one which will be covered from bottom up to the cupola with silver, the same as the roof. The quantity of silver plate which will be needed for the purpose stated is given as 320,000 square feet, which would take 10,000 cubic feet, or 6,515,250 pounds of silver, valued at $65,152,210. It is said that the Omaha people do not intend to buy this immense lot of silver, but will borrow it from the silver mine owners of the western states. After the closing of the exposition it is said the costly building will be burned down and the silver returned to its owners. The building certainly would, in regard to its expensiveness, surpass everything in the of exposition buildings seen heretofore and the purpose would thus be accomplished. But will it be possible to gather that much silver?</p>
<p>Beatrice (Neb.) Post: All newspapers published in the state of Nebraska ought to agitate in favor of the Transmississippi Exposition. "Why, is it not too early to work for this enterprise?" we hear a reader say, "No; certainly not," is our answer in this case. The legislatures of nearly all the western states are in session and the appropriations of the exposition must be made now. Nebraska, being most interested, ought to head all the other states with a liberal appropriation. If this is done her sister states will follow suit quickly and will go to work zealously to be worthily represented at the exposition. It is to be regretted, however, that our legislature does not seem to realize the importance of the matter to Nebraska, and therefore, they ought to be brought to understand by petitions and otherwise from all parts of the state that the people of Nebraska want this enterprise pushed with all possible vigor, and liberally assisted by this commonwealth in order to bring about a most brilliant success. We are satisfied that the exposition will be of great benefit to our beautiful state. Many will come to us, will be convinced by what they see themselves that Nebraska is all right and will be induced either to settle in our midst or to invest their capital. Large sums of money will be set in circulation in Omaha by the visitors of the exposition, and that money will to a great extent go over the state, thus benefiting the latter as well as her metropolitan city. In short: Let everybody work and talk in favor of the great exposition.</p>
<p>New Yorke Pfaeizer in Amerika: At Omaha, Neb., from June to November of next year, a Transmississippi and International Exposition will be held. The same is in the first instance designated to give the states west of the Mississippi river an opportunity to make a showing of their natural resources, their agricultural and industrial production, as well as of their civilization in general. The transmississippi region comprises twenty states and four territories, being the granary of this country and containing the richest grass lands in the union. That region embraces further nearly the whole gold and silver bearing territory and the richest timberlands of North America. It is to be expected that the proposed exposition, which also has been acknowledged by congress, which has clad it with an international character, will be of great benefit to the whole country; first, by bringing closer together east and west; and, second, by stimulating desirable immigration into this country and thus helping to bring more people to the west, where they need a larger population. It is an indisputable fact that the development of the immense western territory has just commenced, and there is no doubt that the exposition will aid very materially to bring about a full 

<pb n="101" xml:id="TMISB02-101"/> 



development of the transmississippi country. Several state legislatures have already expressed their willingness to have their respective states participate in the proposed exposition and have made ample appropriations for a worthy representation.</p>
<p>Sheboygan (Wis.) Volksblatt: While the opponents of immigration in congress at Washington are zealously working to furnish evidence that the United States does not need further immigration, Omaha, the natural center of this country, is preparing an enterprise to prove the contrary, showing that the United States is still able to furnish uncounted millions of people a home, and in fact, is needing further immigration. We speak of the Transmississippi and International Exposition, which is to be held at Omaha between June and November, 1898. The twenty states and four territories west of the Mississippi will furnish evidence at the proposed exposition which will convince all those who did not know, or did not want to know, that the great west of America still needs hundreds of thousands of energetic, intelligent men, able and willing to work, and that only the drawbacks, caused by land speculation, the monopoly of railroads and the usurious interests which are charged by money lenders from the east and Europe, prevented that development from taking its natural course. Had it not been for that the immigrants would have helped greatly to further develop the west and open up even more new lands to cultivation; while for the reasons stated above, those immigrants were compelled to increase the great masses of the unemployed in the streets of our big cities.</p>
<p>Kewaunee (Wis.) Banner: The arrangements for the Transmississippi and International Exposition, which will be held in Omaha, Neb., from June to November, 1898, are being rapidly consummated. The project, when successfully carried through, will doubtless not only benefit the states west of the "Father of Waters" by showing to the world the abundant natural resources of those states, their agricultural and industrial production and the civilization of their population, but it will stimulate desirable immigration into this country. The exposition will further benefit not only the Transmississippi region, but the whole union, for the reason that it will bring the east and west in closer connection. The project had its origin with the Transmississippi Commercial congress, which was held in Omaha in the year 1895, at which twenty-four states and territories west of the Mississippi were represented by delegates. One of the chief attractions of the projected exposition will undoubtedly be the mineral department, showing the precious metals, which in almost unlimited quantities are deposited in the mountains of the great west.</p>
<p>Red Wing (Minn.) Die Teutonia: The exposition to be held in Omaha in the year 1898 is by no means a local or a state affair. It is going to be a Transmississippi Exposition, that is to say, an exposition in which the great west beyond the Mississippi river will participate. In the first instance, the western states, and Nebraska foremost, will reap the benefit coming from the exhibition of the enormous resources of the transmississippi region, but it is safe to say that the whole country will to a certain extent also profit from the great enterprise.</p>
<p>Lansing Die Michigan Staats-Zeitung: As it is known already there will be an exposition of all the western states held during the summer of next year at Omaha, which promises to become so grand that it will outdo all former state expositions. The crowning feature of the exposition will be a silver palace of great dimensions, which will be entirely covered with plates made of pure silver. The projected building will contain the mineral exhibits of the western country.</p>
<p>Winona (Minn.) Westlicher Herold: Every man and every newspaper in the west must be in sympathy with the projected Transmississippi Exposition, to be held in Omaha in the year 1898. The states of the great west will derive much benefit from the exposition because it will give them an opportunity to show to the world the great progress which the west has made within the last twenty-five years, its abundant resources and richness. The natural consequence will doubtless be a closer connection between east and west and a further development of the latter by bringing more people and capital into the Transmississippi region. We, for the present, will do all in our power to further the great enterprise.</p>
<p>Caroll (Ia.) Die Germania: The managers of the proposed Transmississippi Exposition are at this early date hard at work to bring about the greatest possible success for that grand enterprise. Some people think Nebraska only will reap the benefit from that exposition, but we think they are mistaken, and we feel sure that the whole transmississippi country will to a great extent share in the benefit and our state of Iowa in the first instance. The Transmississippi Exposition will bring, among other, more good, thrifty German settlers into the western states, and "that's the stuff" we are after. Work for the exposition!</p>
<p>Celena (O.) Der Mercer County Bote: The people of Omaha are working for the Transmississippi Exposition with their characteristic zeal, and more than $500,000 of the capital stock has been subscribed for in that city within a remarkably short space of time. The board of directors of that enterprise are working with heart and soul and as they met with encouragement in most of the transmississippi states the success of the exposition seems to be assured above all doubt. We are of opinion that what helps one part of this great country will benefit the whole land, and therefore we are heartily in favor of the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
<p>Columbus (O.) Waisenfreund: The promoters of the Transmississippi Exposition, which is to be held at Omaha in 1898, are hard at work to make the proposed exposition a success. The enterprise, if properly carried out, will be of great value to the transmississippi region as well as to the country in general.</p>
<p>Chicago Lutherischer Kirchenbote: We need desirable immigration for our great west; we need men able and willing to further build up the transmississippi country and to invest labor and capital there. The Transmississippi Exposition more than anything else will help to accomplish these purposes.</p>
<p>New Yorker Tagblatt: The preparations for the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held in Omaha from June to November, 1898, are progressing rapidly, and from what we can judge, we must say that the exposition will not only be of great benefit to the transmississippi region, but to the whole country.</p>
<p>New York (N. Y.) Staats-Zeitung: The Transmississippi Exposition, which is to be held in Omaha, Neb., between June and November, 1898, seems to be an assured thing. As we have said on a former occasion, we believe it a step in the right direction, because it will do a whole lot of good to the great west and what is good for the west is also good for the east.</p>
<p>Williamsport (Pa.) Tribuene: From June to November, 1898, the Transmississippi and International Exposition will be held at Omaha, Nebraska's metropolis, which grew so rapidly to be a most important city. The exposition is not only of interest to the transmississippi region, but to the whole United States, and even for the whole world. Its aim is to bring about a closer connection between east and west and to secure for this country the right kind of immigration. At the exposition the western states will give to the visitors an exhibition of their natural resources, their agricultural and industrial products and their civilization in general. The managers of the great enterprise are hard at work and we are satisfied that the exposition will serve its purpose to the fullest possible extent.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">MINNESOTA AND THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">Displaying the Resources of the Imperial west.</head>
<ab>St. Paul Globe.</ab>
<p>A delegation of gentlemen from Omaha are visiting our state to present to the legislature the scope and plan of the Transmississippi Exposition to be held in their city from June to November, 1898, and to invite the state to make an exhibit of its resources with the others. While it is to be representative of the states lying to the west of the great river, it aims to be national and international in its effects, supplementing the World's exposition by doing what that failed to do for the states&#8212;display the resources of this western half of the country. The states at Chicago were lost in the international characters of the display and their several state buildings were little more than convenient clubhouses, where their citizens might rest while viewing the world's exhibits. Should the legislature see fit to accept the invitation and provide for a display of Minnesota's products and progress, action, if the appropriation to be a modest one, we are free to say should be taken, we suggest that the innovation begun at Chicago, of having a state building be abandoned; and whatever appropriation is made be devoted wholly to gathering the various products of our industries and making of them the fullest possible display in one of the large buildings Omaha is erect. It is to these buildings the attendants will go, as they went to them at the World's fair, and it is there that the investment would get the largest return in the advertisement of our resources. The economy that <unclear reason="covered">t</unclear> times demand will thus meet the real purpose of our participation, the advertisement of the state.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">WILL BE A GREAT SUCCESS</head>
<head type="sub">GERALDINE TALKS OF THE EXPOSITION</head>
<head type="sub">Predicts that it Will Surpass in Magnitude and Importance All Other Expositions Since the World's Fair.</head>
<p>Dion Geraldine, superintendent of construction of the Department of Buildings and Grounds of the exposition, while in Chicago, enroute to New Orleans, was interviewed by, a representative of the Times-Herald and expressed his mind very freely regarding the Transmississippi Exposition, Omaha as an exposition city, the site selected for the great fair and many other points of interest in connection with the enterprise. In the course of his interview Mr. Geraldine gave expression to the following:</p>
<p>"The Transmississippi and International Exposition will surpass in magnitude and importance all other expositions in this country since the World's Fair at Chicago. It is bound to be a great success, because the people of Omaha and the west are behind it, which means a great deal. The business men of Omaha are capable of carrying through successfully any enterprise of the kind they are willing to undertake and they are a unit on the exposition. Observe how quickly they settled the question of a site. Omaha has five or six sites, each of which offers peculiar advantages for an exposition. Each had its ardent and determined supports, but when it was found that a site at the north end of the city had enough votes to secure the location all opposition ceased at once and the situation was accepted without muttering or growling. This means a great deal in the handling of an exposition and forecasts the success which I am confident will characterize the exposition.</p>
<p>"Omaha is a city not generally understood or appreciated in the east, and this exposition will do away with a great many mistaken ideas about it. Omaha has stood up against the hard times more successfully than any western city. Up to 1890, when the national census was taken, it was supposed that Kansas City was far ahead of Omaha in population, business and general importance, but the figures placed the Nebraska city in the lead. Then the drouth came, and with it the hard times, and still Omaha kept ahead of Kansas City, both in population and the amount of business transacted. A similar comparison might be made proportionately with other cities of the west. The more you reflect upon this fact the more importance it conveys.</p>
<p>"The site selected is admirably adapted for exposition purposes. It has a fine water supply and excellent drainage, the main sewer of the city running through it. The surface is well adapted to the artistic and harmonious grouping of buildings and landscape work. Nearly all the railroads have direct access to the grounds, and several trolley lines connect with the central part of the city. There is money enough subscribed already to successfully finance and exploit the exposition, and the solid business men of Omaha are giving their time and energy to make it a success. While I was there this week one of the leading bankers, Herman Kountze, at a great personal sacrifice, offered the use of forty acres of partially occupied ground as a part of the exposition site. The Burlington road has subscribed $30,000, notwithstanding it is one of the few railroad companies which has not access to the grounds. Numerous other instances might be cited to show the unity of spirit and energy behind the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
<p>"The state of Illinois and particularly the manufacturers of Chicago should patronize this exposition liberally. We should not forget that the people of the west were the most ardent supporters of our great exposition, and but for their backing and support the World's fair could not have been secured for Chicago. It is to the best interests of Chicago manufacturers to be well represented at the Transmississippi Exposition. Their trade is largely in the west and if the Chicago manufacturers are well represented at the exposition it will bring them in closer contact and better acquaintance with these western customers and enable them to secure a firmer hold on western patronage. If they are not well represented a large percentage of desirable trade will be diverted into other channels. Chicago should recognize the importance of the exposition and protect her own interests by liberally patronizing it.</p>
<p>"The center of trade is steadily moving westward. New York refused to recognize this and it still refused to see the handwriting on the wall when the World's fair came to Chicago, but her leading manufacturers, who were not represented here, discovered their fatal error too late to protect themselves. Eastern manufacturers are displaying an active interest in the exposition and promise to be well represented there.</p>
<p>"The scope of the exposition proper is not fully decided upon. There will probably be nine regular exposition buildings, in addition to the government and state buildings. The style and size of these buildings are not yet fully determined upon and the architects have not been selected.</p>
<p>"We are engaged in looking up the cost of materials before determining the nature of construction. All this will be decided within the next sixty days, after which the work on construction will be put through rapidly and the buildings will be ready for a successful opening may 1, 1898. The landscape work will be pushed with all possible vigor from March 1, in order to secure the benefit of one year's growth in advance. Nearly all the officers and directors of the exposition are now visiting other states to secure their support and complete arrangements for their exhibits.</p>
<p>"As to the nature of the exhibits, they will, of course, comprise nearly everything that enters into an American exposition, but particular importance will be given to the resources of the transmississippi states. The mineral exhibit will surpass anything every shown in any exposition or any country. A large tract of ground will be devoted to the exemplification of irrigation under all its various methods and conditions. This will be intensely interesting to the inhabitants of those states in the Rocky mountain slope where irrigation is slowly coming into general practice. There will also be shown the new methods of cultivating the soil for the retention of moisture, which is revolutionizing many portions of the far west long considered arid. The stock exhibit will probably surpass even that of Chicago's fair.</p>
<p>"A unique and interesting feature, particularly for eastern people and foreigners, will be the assembling of representative tribes of Indians from the British possessions to Mexico, and the various interesting phases of frontier life will be reproduced in detail. American manufacturers of all classes will be well and thoroughly represented. There will be extensive and interesting foreign exhibits also."</p></div2>

<head type="sub">EXPOSITION ENTHUSIASM IS RIFE</head>
<head type="sub">State Officials Legislators and Citizens All Eager to Take Part in the Big Show at Omaha in '98.</head>
<p>LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Feb. 20.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;No committee was ever received more kindly or enthusiastically or treated more generously than the Omaha Exposition committee was here. The delegates called early upon Governor Jones, and, for two hours, were introduced to numerous persons of distinction, including a special committee from each legislative branch. At 11 o'clock a joint informal session was held, to which the Omahans were presented. Messrs. Montgomery and Cornish and Dr. Butler occupied an hour in addresses, which were very generously cheered. Following their remarks, responses were made by ex-Governor Clarke, Governor Jones and Representative Vandeventer, all of whom pledged the state of Arkansas to liberal support of the exposition. Among other things, Governor Jones said he "hoped this legislature would not adjourn till an appropriation had been made to have Arkansas well represented at the exposition, and your committee may be assured that Arkansas may be there with both feet."</p>
<p>Large numbers of citizens were present at the meeting, after which the Omaha visitors were presented to many of the members and visitors. After lunch, they were taken in carriages throughout the city, stopping at one time to visit an immense cotton mill.</p>
<p>Exposition enthusiasm has been created largely by the efforts of Vice President Vinsonhaler, whose ability and influence are of the right kind. It has been said that this is the first visit here of its kind, and the Omaha men have been assured on all points and believe that favorable results are certain. An appropriation of $25,000 at least for an exhibit alone may be expected.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">GIVES SPACE TO THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">Eastern Press is Generous to the Transmississippi Enterprise.</head>
<p>The Transmississippi Exposition is attracting widespread attention in the east and the great metropolitan dailies are devoting considerable space to exploiting the great affair. The most elaborate and extensive notice which has so far been given the exposition by outside papers was that contained in the Buffalo Express of last Sunday. The first part of that issue of the Express was a handsomely illustrated, eight-page paper, printed on a fine quality of paper, and the illustrations in what are known to the trade as "half tones." The letter press was well nigh perfect and the full page devoted to the great exposition was liberally interspersed with cuts. There were cuts of the city hall in Omaha, the new federal building, the court house, the proposed silver palace, a scene from Hanscom park and photographs of President Wattles and Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity. The reading matter consisted of a concise statement of the origin and progress of the exposition movement, the plan and scope of the great affair and an exhaustive statement of the resources of the transmississippi region, concluding with a history of Omaha and a pen picture of the city as it appears today.</p>
<p>A number of copies of the Express have been received in this city and they have been posted in the prominent store windows of the city by the recipients and each one forms the center of admiring groups of passersby on the street.</p>
<p>The exposition is also being liberally advertised by the newspapers in the cities visited by the several parties of promoters now touring the transmississippi states exploiting the exposition and appearing before the various legislatures. Nearly all of the papers in the cities in which stops are made devote one or more columns each day to accounts of the work of the parties and the conferences with members of the legislatures and with business organization so that the people of those states are receiving abundant information regarding the matter.</p></div2>

No finer looking body of men ever sat in any legislative hall than greeted the northern committee yesterday, but the ladies of Bismarck are even better looking than the men, or the judgment of the committee is lame.</p>
<p>Besides beautiful women, there are forty-one inches of beautiful snow, by government measurement, lying on the ground, and it is still snowing and blowing a half gale. The record for deep snow in the Dakotas is beaten now by thirteen inches, and two months to hear from yet.</p>

It seems that complications arose which the parties could not disentangle without Mr. Geraldine's assistance. He will probably be absent from Omaha until the middle of next week.</p>
<p>Secretary Wakefield has received a telegram from C. S. Montgomery, of the party of exposition promoters which is touring the southern states, suggesting that the merchants of Omaha correspond with their business friends in the several states in which appropriation bills are now pending and induce them to write to the legislators and ask them to support the bills.</p>
<p>The regular weekly meeting of the executive committee was not held yesterday for  the reason that not enough members of the committee are in the city for a quorum.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">LANCASTER COUNTY SUPPORTS THE BILL</head>
<head type="sub">Burkett, Chosen as Chairman, Rules Against Wooster's Obstructionary Tactics and Allows Gaflin's Substitute to Come In.</head>
<p>STATE HOUSE, LINCOLN, Neb., Feb. 23.&#8212;Special Telegram.)&#8212;The house went into committee of the whole promptly at 2:30 to consider the Transmississippi Exposition bill.</p>
<p>Burkett of Lancaster was called to preside as chairman of the committee of the whole in considering the bill. This means that the Lancaster delegation has been persuaded to assume a more friendly attitude to the measure.</p>
<p>The original bill appropriation $350,000 was first read. When the first section had been read Wooster of Merrick insisted on discussion, section by section. Speaker Gaffin announced if that was to be the order he desired to offer a substitute for the whole bill.</p>
<p>The chair ruled that the original bill should first be read through without discussion.</p>
<p>When the bill had been read Gaffin offered his substitute bill. After the clerk had read the substitute bill Winslow, populist of Gosper, moved that the original bill, amendments and substitute be reported back to the house with recommendation that the whole matter be indefinitely postponed. This motion was seconded by Jenkins, republican of Jefferson.</p>
<p>Winslow led off in the opposition to the <choice><sic>bil.l</sic><corr>bill.</corr></choice> He spoke for fifteen minutes, and delivered an impassioned argument. The house listened in perfect silence, only once showing any evidence of a desire to applaud. He closed his remarks in silence.</p>
<p>Horner, populist of Dawson, then took the floor in support of the substitute.</p>
<p>Horner spoke for ten minutes in favor of the substitute bill, and was frequently applauded. His eloquent <choice><sic>perovation</sic><corr>peroration</corr></choice> in which he urged all Nebraska to be proud of Omaha, the metropolis of the west, was received with round after round of applause.</p>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">INTEREST MONTANA IN THE SHOW.</head>
<head type="sub">Bureau of Promotion Proposed to Raise Private Subscriptions.</head>
<p>HELENA, Mont., Feb. 23.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Although it was Washington's birthday and a legal holiday, the Omaha delegation that is now visiting the west in the interests of the big exposition in 1898 was accorded a reception by the state legislature here yesterday, the meeting having been arranged by telegram when it was found that the party could not reach Helena in time to attend the meeting last Saturday. It was a joint informal session, at which all the members were present. There were addresses by Gilbert M. Hitchcock, President Wattles, John L. Webster, Captain H. E. Palmer and W. S. Poppleton, and after that Governor Smith, who was in the audience, was called upon for an address. He responded briefly.</p>
<p>"I am sure of these propositions," he said, "that if Montana has the natural resources we claim the world will only find it out by our advertising it, and that the proper time to advertise is during periods of depression. I am sure that the exposition at Omaha is going to be of more important to the people of the west than any of the expositions that have been held in the history of this country. At the World's fair our exhibitions were overshadowed by those of older and richer states. I do not believe there is a state in the union of more varied natural resources than Montana, and as I view it no time could be more favorable for the advancement of the interests of our state than 1898. Montana could not afford not to be represented then.</p>
<p>"This assembly should at least provide for an organization to advance the interests of Montana. If it does I am sure that the public spirit of our people will not fail and if this assembly sees fit to make a small appropriation it would meet with the approval, I believe, of the people of the state."</p>
<p>After the session of the joint assembly there was a meeting of the senate committee on finance and claims, and the committees on appropriations and ways and means of the house, at which the members of the visiting party went more fully into details as to what they thought the state might do. They said, after the condition of the finances of the state had been discussed pretty generally, that they thought an appropriation of $25,000 would bring many times that amount in results in the future.</p>
<p>The committees adjourned without taking definite action, but it is generally understood that they will recommend a small appropriation, perhaps of $2,000, to assist in the organization of a state bureau of promotion. The commissioner, or whoever is appointed, will be charged with the duty of interesting others in the exposition, as it is believed a creditable amount could be raised by personal subscriptions if the expenses of raising it were paid and a man selected to attend to it. The appropriation would be expected to cover only the expenses of the preliminary work. There is no prospect that an appropriation of any considerable amount would find favor with the legislature.</p>
<p>The members of the party left the city yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock on the Montana Central for Butte. They expect to visit the Boise legislature today and will go from there to Olympia, Wash.</p>
<p>Owing to the pied condition of politics in Oregon they do not expect to accomplish much in that state, except in interesting the people of Portland as individuals. They will visit Sacramento the latter part of this week or early next.</p></div2>

<p>KASOTA, Minn., Feb. 22.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The exposition delegation has been compelled to forego its trip to Pierre on account of the continued blockading of the railroads. The delegation left Minneapolis this morning and proceeded west of this junction a few miles when the train was compelled to return. The delegates will arrive at Omaha on Tuesday morning. The party was joined here by Judge Scott this morning, who will arrive home with the car and open court at the usual hour.</p></div2>

<p>LINCOLN, Feb. 23.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The record was broken this morning in the house for petitions favoring a liberal appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition. They came from Saline, Valley, Antelope, Red Willow and Cass counties, and ranged in amounts from $100,000 to $350,000, the sum of $200,000 being the predominating amount. Some thirty-five bills were recommended for passage on reports from standing committees.</p>
<p>Bower of Howard sprung the following resolution:</p>
<p>Resolved, that it is the deliberative judgment of this house of representatives that without further delay we instruct the attorney general to at once commence legal proceedings against the state officials who are known to be short in their accounts with the state.</p>
<p>Resolved, That it is detrimental both to the morals and integrity of the state to further delay action in so grave a matter from a monetary consideration.</p>

<div2 type="article"><head type="main">BACK FROM A NORTHERN TOUR</head>
<head type="sub">EXPOSITION COMMITTEE RETURNS HOME</head>
<head type="sub">Lindsey Tells of the Reception in Minnesota and North Dakota&#8212;Both States Will Be Represented at Omaha in 1898.</head>
<p>Z. T. Lindsey, chairman of the executive committee of the Transmississippi Exposition, returned this noon from a tour of Minnesota and North Dakota in the interest of the exposition. Mr. Lindsey was the only one left of the original committee that went north, the other members having been called home by private business. He was accompanied to Omaha, however, by E. W. Caldwell of the Sioux City Journal, who joined the Omaha party at Sioux City on its way north, and by Martin Whitcomb of Minneapolis, who visited North Dakota with the party and rendered able assistance by means of his wide acquaintance in that section.</p>
<p>Mr. Lindsey expressed himself most enthusiastically about the trip. He said there was no question but that the trip had been most advantageous for the exposition and that the effect would be far reaching.</p>
<p>"The greatest difficulty we encountered," said Mr. Lindsey, "was the idea that the exposition was simply a local affair. Of course we devoted ourselves to correcting this impression and we were signally successful in overcoming the feeling, which amounted almost to a prejudice against the exposition. After that we had smooth sailing and found the people awake to the importance of being represented at the show. We went first to Duluth and then to Minneapolis and St. Paul. In each of these places we were given columns of space in the newspapers and the whole exposition project was thoroughly advertised. We were most cordially received after we had eradicated the wrong impression that seemed to exist and I believe that we have stirred up the state of Minnesota from one end to the other. At Duluth we were entertained by the Board of Trade and at Minneapolis the Commercial Club received us royally. At St. Paul we were given a cordial welcome and I am satisfied that the state will be creditably represented in the exposition.</p>
<p>"Our visit to North Dakota was most timely, and we were given a cordial welcome. The people there are fully alive to the importance of the exposition, and they expect to raise fully $50,000 for exploiting their resources. A bill appropriating $15,000 has been introduced in the legislature, and they expect to raise the balance of the $50,000 by other means. The railroads will probably do a <choice><sic>parge</sic><corr>large</corr></choice> part toward making a creditable exhibit, and I feel sure that the state will make an exhibit that will be a credit to the exposition.</p>
<p>"We intended to go to Pierre, the capital of South Dakota," continued Mr. Lindsey, "but the snow was so deep that all trains were abandoned, and we were unable to get there. It is possible that we may go there later, but the session of the legislature is so nearly over that it may be decided to leave that state to the vice president."</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">BRIGHT OUTLOOK IN THE NORTH.</head>
<head type="sub">Minnesota and North Dakota are Interested in the Exposition.</head>
<p>L. F. Crofoot has returned from a trip through Minnesota and North Dakota, where he went with the exposition committee to awaken the interest of the legislatures. He expressed himself very enthusiastically over the manner in which the party was received in the various cities they visited and believed that much had been accomplished in the interests of the exposition. "The great thing we accomplished," said Mr. Crofoot, "was to convince the people whom we visited that the exposition is not an Omaha affair, but is in the interests of all the transmississippi states. In this I believe we succeeded and nothing could be more encouraging than the interest which the business men whom we met manifested in the enterprise. The people of Duluth and St. Paul seem to be fully as enthusiastic over the exposition as we are in Omaha, and if times are in any degree encouraging we will have a big attendance from Minnesota and the Dakotas."</p>
<p>The party went first to Duluth, where it was enthusiastically received, and the business men of Duluth took hold at once to assist it to secure favorable legislative action. Mr. Crofoot is satisfied that the Minnesota legislature will make an appropriation of from $25,000 to $50,000, and one of the encouraging indications is that Ignatius Donnelly, from whom some opposition was expected, has agreed to use his influence in favor of the appropriation.</p>
<p>At Bismarck the party was equally well received, and while North Dakota is not able to make a big appropriation, it is nearly certain that a sufficient sum will be provided to make a very creditable exhibit.</p></div2>

<p>The plan providing for a Board of Lady Managers for the exposition provides that woman shall be sent from Omaha to each of the congressional districts where an election is held to elect members of the board, the purpose being to have the plan of the board fully explained to the meetings of women. It has been decided, however, that this is unnecessary, in view of the fact that the matter has been given wide publicity through the newspapers, and Secretary Wakefield has accordingly sent to the mayor of each of the towns where these meetings are to be held a letter explaining the matter and requesting the mayor to call the meeting to order and turn it over to the women. A copy of the plan adopted for the creation of the board is also sent to be read to the meeting and the women will then be left to go it alone, the only provision being that the chairman or secretary shall notify Secretary Wakefield of the result of the election.</p></div2>

The ex-governor says he has no desire to embarrass the exposition management in any way, and does not wish to stand in the way of an appropriation.

<head type="sub">Private Citizens Will Raise Funds Even if Legislature Does Nothing.</head>
<p>BOISE, Idaho, Feb. 24.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The Transmississippi Exposition committee, headed by President Wattles, will arrive in Boise today. Yesterday Governor Steunenberg sent a special message to the legislature calling attention to the visit of the committee and adding:</p>
<p>"I am informed that one of the desires of the visiting delegation is to present the aims and objects of the exposition to the present session of the legislature, and I would respectfully recommend that a joint session for this purpose be arranged for tomorrow afternoon or evening. This courtesy has already been extended the distinguished visitors by the legislatures of the states of Colorado, Wyoming and Montana, and I have no doubt you will cheerfully accord them this favor."</p>
<p>Conference committees were appointed to arrange a joint session for the reception of the committee. The proposed exposition has been talked and written up a great deal here for some time, and no little interest has been aroused. It is not known whether the legislature will make an appropriation, but strong influences are at work with that end in view. It may be said, however, that Idaho will be well represented at Omaha even though the legislature does nothing as private citizens will raise funds sufficient to install a creditable exhibit.</p></div2>

<p>STATE HOUSE, LINCOLN, Feb. 24.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The discussion of the exposition bill was resumed in the house this morning and the crowds in attendance were as large as those of yesterday afternoon. The members gathered slowly only sixty-three answering to their names at the roll call. The opponents of the bill led by Wooster of Merrick were anxiously active on the floor during the early part of the morning hour. Wooster went from desk to desk with whispered words of advice.</p>
<p>It was not until 10:30 that the house resolved itself into committee of the whole Burkett of Lancaster being again invited to the chair. Felker attempted to limit debate by moving that the opponents of the bill be given one hour's time and the friends twenty minutes in which to discuss the question. The motion received no second however, and the debate began.</p>
<p>Eastman of Custer opened by a vigorous denunciation of the exposition.</p>
<p>Snyder of Sherman, the oldest member of the house, insisted that the times were unpropitious for the holding of an exposition; but he said the exposition was a fixed fact and that Nebraska should appropriate at least $100,000 toward making an exhibit for the state.</p>
<p>Loomis of Butler opposed the bill in a brief speech on the grounds that times were too hard.</p>
<p>Sheldon of Dawes talked earnestly in favor of the appropriation, asserting that it would be a good financial investment for Nebraska.</p>
<p>Eighmy of Brown spoke briefly in favor of the exposition appropriation. The committee then rose and agreed to sit again at 2 o'clock this afternoon.</p>

<p>Hill, populist of Clay, opposed the whole exposition project on the ground that it was an Omaha side show.</p>
<p>Stebbins, populist of Lincoln county, favored the bill, saying that the eastern part of the state had always helped the west in drouth times, and if the west would stand by the east, all h&#8212;l couldn't keep Nebraska down.</p>
<p>Chittenden, republican of Gage, wanted <choice><sic>action action</sic><corr>action</corr></choice> on the exposition bill deferred until after <choice><sic>thes tate</sic><corr>the state</corr></choice> institutions had been provided for.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of his remarks there were loud calls of "vote, vote," but Eager of Seward and Wooster of Merrick were on their feet claiming recognition. Eager was recognized and proceeded to talk against the bill.</p>
<p>At 3:30 Wooster of Merrick began his <choice><sic>arment</sic><corr>argument</corr></choice> against the bill. He used the same assertions he has made all along.</p>
<p>Speaker Gaffin thinks a vote may be reached this afternoon.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">TUESDAY AFTERNOON'S SESSION.</head>
<p>The Transmississippi Exposition bill had been made a special order for 2:30 Tuesday afternoon and everybody in Lincoln, natives and strangers within the gates, was aware of the fact. Long before the hour set for the after recess assembly the gallery and floor of the house began to fill up. Notwithstanding a stringent rule adopted by the house last week against lobbying in the hall of representatives, O. E. Goodell went around among the members distributing strips of green paper with warning admonitions written on them, all of different wording, but of the same tenor&#8212;opposition to the pending measure. One of them bore the inscription: "You are trifling with solid men and tender hearts when you vote $350,000 for the Transmississippi Exposition." Another bore the legend: "It's a dream. A sham. Vote what you please, your money is lost and gone. The people of Nebraska cannot by any possibility make an exposition and go to it naked."</p>
<p>At 2:15, the hour set for the special order, Speaker Gaffin directed Chief Clerk Eager to call the roll. Ninety-two members answered present.</p>
<p>Four petitions from Washington county were read, all in favor of liberal appropriations for the exposition, and one from Seward county opposing the same.</p>
<p>Speaker Gaffin then announced that the hour for consideration of the special order in committee of the whole had arrived, and invited Burkett of Lancaster to the chair. Clerk Eager proceeded to read the original bill, appropriating $350,000 for the exposition, section by section. Section 1 was passed over in silence. Sutton of Pawnee moved an amendment to section 2, that the governor appoint six instead of twelve directors.</p>
<p>Wooster directed attention that while no objections were being made to the different sections, he wanted it understood that the opponents would lose no rights. Chairman Burkett replied that no snap shots would be taken on any one.</p>
<p>Then Speaker Gaffin, from his place on the floor, said that if the bill was read section by section and amended considerable time would be lost. He offered a substitute for the whole bill, appropriating $200,000.</p>
<p>Chairman Burkett said that it would be as well to read the original bill through without amendment and then take up Gaffin's substitute.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">GAFFIN'S SUBSTITUTE BILL.</head>
<p>Pollard of Cass then called for the amendments made by the committee on finance, ways and means and they were read. This did away with Sutton's amendment, which was withdrawn. On conclusion of the reading of the bill Gaffin moved his substitute, as follows:</p>
<p>Section 1. That the state of Nebraska take part in the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898, as hereinafter provided.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That the governor of the state of Nebraska be and he is hereby authorized and directed to appoint a state board of directors of twelve members, consisting of two representative citizens from each congressional district for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this act.</p>
<p>Sec. 3: That each member of said board of directors so appointed by the governor as provided in section 2 hereof shall have and receive as full compensation for services as members of said board the sum of $50 per month and no more, and that the time for which they shall draw such monthly pay shall not exceed fifteen months in the aggregate for each member of said board.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. That for the purpose of assisting the state of Nebraska to make a proper state exhibit in said Transmississippi and International Exposition, to properly plan, advertise, carry on, develop and complete the said state exhibit in said exposition and the erection of a suitable building therefor and for the purpose of paying the salaries of each of the members of said board appointed by the governor, to pay the salaries of all superintendents, managers and employes, together with all other expenses which in the opinion of said board may be necessary to carry out the purposes of Nebraska's representation at this exposition, the sum of $200,000 be and the same is hereby appropriated from the state treasury out of any fund not otherwise appropriated.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. That said board of state directors appointed by the governor as herein provided shall act in conjunction with the board of directors of the corporation known as the Transmississippi and International Exposition association, but the money hereby appropriated as provided herein shall be under the control and management of said state board appointed by the governor.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. It shall be the duty of said board of directors so appointed by the governor on being notified by the governor of their appointment to meet at the governor's office in the city of Lincoln, receive from the governor their certificates of appointment and organize by the election of a president, vice president and secretary from among their number as officers of said board.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. That said sum of money or as much thereof as may be necessary shall be and become available for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this act, the making of said state exhibit, the erection of a suitable building therefor and all other things necessary to properly plan, advertise, carry on, develop and complete said state exhibit from and after the taking effect of this act as herein provided, that is to say, that when said state board or a majority thereof shall duly certify to the governor of the state and attach to such certificates an itemized statement on a uniform voucher, attested by the president and secretary of said board and approved by the governor in writing the auditor of public accounts is hereby authorized and directed to draw a warrant on the state treasurer to the order of the person entitled therein as shown by the itemized statement on the uniform voucher.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. The place of business of said board of directors after its organization shall be in the city of Omaha, in the state of Nebraska, in suitable rooms provided by said state board, and it shall be the duty of said board to keep a complete and detailed record open to public inspection at all times of each and every act respecting the expenditure of said money, and an itemized statement of all expenses and indebtedness incurred, for what and with whom and the amount thereof. It shall also be the duty of said board, by its president and secretary, to make a report to the governor every thirty days in writing of the acts <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> of said board, as herein pro-</p>

<pb n="105" xml:id="TMISB02-105"/> 



<p>On the suggestion of Sheldon of Dawes the substitute was first read through entire and then disposed of section by section.</p></div3>
        <div3>
<head type="sub">OPPOSITION OPENS ITS FIGHT.</head>
<p>Winslow of Gosper, on completion of the reading of the bill, moved that when the committee rose it report the bill back for indefinite postponement. On this amendment he made a speech. He said the press had abused the opponents of the bill, but he was proud to say they had the great courage to stand by what they thought was right. No party whip could be cracked about his ears. The populists had been charged with digging their political graves. He didn't know whether this was true or not. But times were tight. Nebraska should first see whether or not she had money enough in her purse to pay her running expenses before she indulged in a show in Omaha. He then proceeded to advance some pecuniary statistics concerning the taxable property of Nebraska. The alleged defalcation in the state treasury next attracted his attention. In conclusion he declared he should first cast his vote against a show in Omaha until the wards of the state were provided for, and if there was any money left he would be willing to take the exposition into consideration. It had been said the exposition would advertise the state. "Good God! Every newspaper in the state advertised it with the long array of chattel mortgage sales and notices of foreclosure."</p>
<p>Mr. Winslow lost his voice early in the course of his speech and it became evidently quite painful for him to articulate. He said it was necessary for himself to economize closely to supply his family with the necessaries of life. What was true of his individual case was also true of the state of Nebraska. When his voice had failed entirely Winslow sat down.</p>
<p>Horner of Dawson said that while he believed the gentleman who had preceded him was very much in interest, he could see many reasons why the state should vote a certain amount to the exposition. There were a variety of reasons why this should be done, good reasons, every one. Nebraska's honor and credit were at stake. Today Nebraska stood ready to pay back every dollar that had been given her in charity. If other states would not accept it, as was the case, the state was not the least to blame. Every dollar earned by the exposition, he said, would flow back into the pockets of residents of Nebraska. Directly and indirectly the enterprise would be profitable to every resident of the state. Refusal to make an appropriation would not increase the price of a bushel of corn or a pound of meat on foot. Divide the amount asked for this enterprise by the per capita of the state, and he believed a man would be ashamed to stand here on the floor and oppose it. Opponents of the exposition had said it would build up Omaha. And what of it? Illinois was proud of her metropolis and Nebraska should stand up for Omaha and Nebraska. For one he proposed to do it.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WHY JENKINS DOESN'T LIKE IT.</head>
<p>Jenkins of Jefferson, who had seconded Winslow's motion for indefinite postponement, followed Horner. The question, he said, was divided into two heads: Shall we have an exposition? How much shall we appropriate for it? When the matter of the exposition was first broached, no one outside of Omaha had been asked to subscribe to the stock. Forty-nine out of the committee of fifty were Omaha citizens. He could not but regard it as a local affair. Mr. Jenkins then drifted into a discussion of the financial condition of the state. He called attention to the fact that a half-million of dollars was placed where nobody knew where it was, and the money in state depositories was in such a shape that it was dangerous to attempt to draw it out. Mr. Jenkins was of the opinion that a great deal of trade would be deflected from the smaller towns of the state and concentrated in the emporiums and <choice><sic>bazars</sic><corr>bazaars</corr></choice> in Omaha. Mr. Jenkins found considerable fault with the substitution of Mr. Gaffin's amendment for the original bill as amended by the committee. The directorship, he said, instead of being concentrated in Omaha, should have been distributed throughout the state. The appropriations bills would be submitted next week. It would be found that the pruning knife had been run in clear up to the hilt. Salaries had been cut in every department in the interest of economy. And yet, we were asked to take all the savings made by such parsimony, lump it into a basket, carry it up to Omaha, and make a present to an Omaha local enterprise. Were the finances of the state in good condition, he would be in favor of the enterprise. As it was, he strongly opposed it.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">POLLARD'S LOGICAL PLEA.</head>
<p>Pollard of Cass spoke in favor of the exposition and began to treat it logically. Were the question first sprung today, Shall Nebraska have an exposition? he should vote no. But the exposition was here, was upon us. The matter had been allowed to drift along until now the state could do nothing else than vote something. But the speaker wanted to make a statement as a republican, he wanted to say that if the bill was defeated the whole blame would fall on one G. M. Hitchcock of Omaha. That gentleman had blundered at almost every step he had taken. After thus clearing the way of certain obstacles, Mr. Pollard warmed up to an eloquent plea in behalf of the exposition. Something had been said about the crippled finances of the state. He wanted to say that if the legislature would take hold of the proposed revenue law, house roll No. 217, and pass it, there were provisions in the bill that would make up for all moneys expended for the largest amounts of appropriation asked for the Transmississippi Exposition. So far as the state finances were concerned, the question was now pending in the supreme court whether or not the incoming state treasurer should accept certificates of deposit or not. Until that decision was rendered no man could say that any certain amount of state money was a total loss. <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> would make good any present deficiency. Not until the time came when he had failed to do so, could any man justly say the money had been embezzled. So far as the main question was concerned, he believed the exposition would be a great thing for Nebraska. It would bring thousands of people here, and they would go out over the state, and for one he was not afraid to have them do that. They would bring money to the state; they would spend money in the state. Why not invite them to come?</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">GAFFIN PRESSES FOR A VOTE.</head>
<p>Speaker Gaffin, from Hull's seat, directed attention to the fact that all the oratory on the floor would not change one vote on the bill. The question of indefinite postponement was before the house. He was in favor of taking a vote and finding whether or not it was to be postponed.</p>
<p>Then Wooster accused Speaker Gaffin of trying to gag the members with the previous question.</p>
<p>Gaffin disclaimed any intention of calling for the previous question, and directed the attention of the Merrick county iconoclast that in committee of the whole the previous question could not be called for.</p>
<p>Wooster declared that the question should be discussed if it took until tomorrow night. He said that he would not discuss the question now and sat down.</p>
<p>Smith of Douglas explained the inception and progress of the exposition enterprise up to date. He proceeded to read from a published document, amid almost continual interruptions by Wooster and others, and fully illustrated, step by step, the incentives and moving springs of the enterprise.</p>
<p>Webb of Custer thought that Smith was not speaking to the amendment, but Chairman Burkett convinced him that his fears were groundless.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith showed that the amount asked by the substitute bill, $200,000, was only about 20 cents per capita, less than $1 for every vote cast at the last election. The subscription list in Omaha, he said, would run near to $600,000. Congress had already voted $200,000, and this might be raised to $275,000.</p></div3>
<div3>    
<head type="sub">DEPRECATES THE JEALOUSY.</head>
<p>Smith replied to a statement that Jenkins had made that the Douglas county delegation had promised the republican minority that if they, the republicans, would vote for an appropriation, the Douglas county republicans would not be unseated. He said such propositions had been extended by the republicans, but had been rejected. Jenkins denied that he, personally, had made any such propositions, and there remained a difference of opinion between Smith and Jenkins, when Smith sat down and Fouke of Gage rose to speak in favor of the appropriation. The location for the exposition had been made at Omaha, he said. Was that not a good place, as good as any other in the state, and as accessible by railways? There should be no jealousy of the metropolis of Nebraska. Even as a state enterprise it would have to be located in some part of the state. If the exposition were not held in Omaha, it would be held in Kansas City, and Nebraska would become the laughing stock of the nation. Were Nebraskans ready to step down and out and confess themselves paupers and not able to hold an exposition, even when granted governmental aid? The state was interested in having a suitable exposition if any was held. The people of Gage county had instructed him to this effect and he was here to do his duty. If any one was ashamed of his state let him stand up.</p>
<p>Wooster asked him to repeat the question so that he could know what he was to stand up for.</p>
<p>Fouke repeated the question and, incidentally roasted Wooster to a brown finish. As a whole his speech was a good one and quite effective.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">CLARK DEFENDS HIS CONSTITUENTS.</head>
<p>Clark of Richardson said that he repelled the insinuation that the people who had sent him many petitions were shysters, as had been stated. They were the best people of Richardson county and he was to carry out their wishes. He did not propose to debate the question, for he did not think it needed it. But congress had located the exposition at Omaha and he was proud of that fact.</p>
<p>Wooster sprung a point of order on Clark, and said that he had raised the point on him.</p>
<p>"Yes," quickly replied Clark, "and you didn't shut off, either."</p>
<p>Wooster sunk quietly into his high-backed chair, and Clark went ahead and showed that now was the time for Nebraska to make a suitable display of her glorious possibilities.</p>
<p>Gaylord of Buffalo proceeded to trace, from his point of view, the history of the exposition plans. He didn't take any stock in the enterprise. He accused the speaker of not having drafted his own substitute, and urged that fact as a reason why the bill should not pass. Gaylord found all kinds of fault with the working of the bill, but his suggestions were not made in the form of amendments. This evident lack of good faith was commented on by members and spectators alike.</p>
<p>Hamilton of Butler opposed the bill for the reason that the exposition would benefit the people of the eastern portion of the state more than it would those of the western portion. No one, he said, in the state of Nebraska had been benefited by the appropriation made for the World's fair.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">TAKE A RECESS TILL MORNING.</head>
<p>Wheeler then moved that the committee of the whole, now rise, report progress and ask leave to sit again this evening at 7 o'clock. Clark of Lancaster moved an amendment to ask leave to sit tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock. Sheldon of Dawes was opposed to the night project. Robertson of Holt made the point of order that the committee of the whole could not adjourn itself. It was dependent on the action of the house. The chair held the committee could only ask permission of the house. Wooster did not want to come to the house tonight, but Smith of Douglas, introducer of the exposition bill, was in favor of a night session, after having voted for it, explaining that he had learned it would be impossible for a number of members to be present. Clark's amendment carried by a vote of 46 to 44.</p>
<p>The committee of the whole rose and reported. Sheldon of Dawes moved that the report by amended by striking out "10 o'clock a. m. tomorrow," and inserting "7:30 this evening." A roll call was demanded with the result that it was defeated by 53 to 43 as follows:</p>

<head type="sub">Members of the Omaha Committee Given a Hearty Welcome in Arkansas, Where a Liberal State Appropriation is Promised.</head>
<p>The party of exposition promoters who are visiting the southern states are being received with ovations and are captivating the entire population, according to the newspapers published in that section. The Little Rock Gazette, the principal paper in Little Rock, contained a long account of the reception given to the party in that city last Saturday. The party appeared before the legislature in the capitol building and the audience was composed largely of women of the state. C. S. Montgomery and E. J. Cornish made short addresses, in which they explained the exposition and its importance to the south, but the honors of the occasion were carried off by Rev. S. Wright Butler, who delivered one of his characteristic speeches. The Gazette speaks in terms of highest praise of the eloquence of the speaker and tells how he kept his hearers in the best of humor by his reference to local matters and was liberally applauded in his oratorical flights. When he attempted to stop, the audience insisted that he continue and one of the women presented him with a beautiful bunch of violets. In the afternoon the party again assembled in the legislative hall and Mrs. C. A. Forney of Hope, president of the United Daughters of the Confederacy of Arkansas, presented the visitors with a magnificent floral offering. The presentation speech was made by Hon. J. W. Keesee, member from Phillips county. Dr. Butler responded on behalf of the exposition party.</p>
<p>The account in the Gazette also states that the legislature is disposed to vote a liberal appropriation for an Arkansas exhibit, and the best of feeling towards the project is said to prevail in that section.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><dateline>THE MINNEAPOLIS TIMES, THUR MORNING, FEBRUARY 18, 1897.</dateline>
    <head type="main">BOOMED OMAHA'S EXPO</head>
<head type="sub">F. H. PEAVEY PRESENTS ITS CLAIMS TO THE SENATE.</head>
<head type="sub">Messrs. Z. T. Lindsey and George F. Wright Speak on Behalf of the Enterprise.</head>
<p>In the senate yesterday morning the matter of appropriation money for the Great Trans-Mississippi Exposition at Omaha, in 1898, came up. Senator Potter asked that Frank H. Peavey, the vice-president for Minnesota, be allowed to speak. Mr. Peavey had previously issued this address to the members.</p>
<p>To the Legislators of Minnesota: In this state, and in the entire west, the complaint is heard everywhere that money is scarce, taxes high, and immigration stopped. But no part of the United States is so richly endowed with natural advantages as Minnesota. Varied and extensive resources, rich and cheap lands, unusual market facilities, a healthful climate, and unexcelled educational and social advantages, make a combination that, properly known, should rapidly fill up and develop this state, to the great advantage of all property owners and business men. The remedy is in our hands and the time for action is ripe. Intelligent and vigorous work and action, for a short time, will start new streams of money, immigration and prosperity flowing throughout the state.</p>
<p>On June 1, 1898, the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, at Omaha, will open its doors for the display of the resources of twenty-four states and territories west of the Mississippi. It will be the best opportunity ever offered to this part of the country to show itself to the business world. At the World's Columbian Exposition the exhibits of these states were almost lost amid the vast collections of the whole world.</p>
<p>The Trans-Mississippi Exposition will probably have more than $2,000,000 at its disposal before the gates are opened, which sum insures an exposition worthy of the same. The general government has voted $200,000 for an exhibit, and has invited the nations of the earth to participate.</p>    
<p>In an exhibition of this character and magnitude, Minnesota, one of the trans-Mississippi states, cannot afford to be left out, and, as the vice-president for this state, I am desirous and ambitious to see magnificent Minnesota properly displayed to the world. The impelling motive in my desire is not idle vanity, but the conviction that the business interests of the state will receive an impetus greatly needed at this time. The money invested should be returned many times over.</p>
<p>It will be my purpose to make a judicious and economical use of whatever funds may be voted. The times do not admit of lavish display, but demand the largest possible returns for a moderate expenditure.</p>
<p>In several states bills are not introduced, providing for appropriations varying from $50,000 to $300,000. If the general proposition meets with your approval, I will be glad, at an early date, to confer with any committees you may appoint, and will also have present representatives from the exposition, in order that you may act with full intelligence.</p>
<p>As a preliminary expression, I will be glad to receive a personal reply to this communication from every member of the legislature who will so favor me.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<ab>&#8212;F. H. Peavey.</ab>
<p>Vice-president for Minnesota of this Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.</p>
<p>Mr. Peavey appeared before the legislature to introduce Zachary T. Lindsey of the executive board of managers.</p>
<p>Mr. Lindsey explained the purpose of the coming Transcontinental exposition. He said he wanted Minnesota to follow the example of Nebraska and Kansas, and appropriate $100,000 or $200,000 for the big 1898 enterprise. He believed Minnesota could well afford to have the representation and interest in that congress that such an appropriation would give. He declared that no such event had been announced before in the world's history, and that the great Trans-Mississippi exposition would be of more vital interest and import to the west than any single thing that the last twenty-five years had recorded.</p>
<p>George F. Wright of Council Bluffs spoke at some length, urging the claims of the west on the north star state, which, he declared, was looked to by all the western states to lead the procession and to set the example for other states in a matter so vitally touching the deepest interests of all the west and to foster an enterprise which would surely add to Minnesota's own glory.</p>
<p>He briefly touched up the legislature for a good round appropriation.</p>
<p>C. M. Hare of Council Bluffs, Iowa, concluded a masterful presentation of the case in the following language:</p>
<p>We believe that this enterprise will commend itself to the business judgment of every member of this body and to every business man and farmer of your great commonwealth. We do not ask you to aid an Omaha exposition, not even one of the mid-central west, but one which will be as its name indicates representative of the entire trans-Mississippi country. Whatever appropriation you make will be simply to secure a credible exhibition of the wealth and resources of Minnesota, and in this expenditure subject to the conditions your wisdom may impose. We come to you believing that the pluck, energy and business judgment which has dotted the north star state all over with thriving cities will not permit it to lag behind the other states of the trans-Mississippi country when this exposition will have opened.</p>
<p>Z. T. Lindsey, chairman of the executive committee, as well as of the ways and means committee of the Trans-Mississippi International Exposition, is one of the substantial men of Omaha that have undertaken the task of preparing an exposition of the products of twenty states and territories.</p>
<p>In an interview with a Times representative yesterday, Mr. Lindsey said he wished to correct the impression that the exposition was to be "an Omaha affair."</p>
<p>"While our city will be greatly benefited," he said, "the international exposition will as thoroughly represent the states and territories taking part in it as the world's fair did the various countries of the globe.</p>
<p>"I would like to say a word," he continued, "relative to the appropriation which we hope the legislature of your state will make for the Trans-Mississippi idea. Each state will handle its own funds in arranging for their exhibits, under the rules of the association, and not one dollar will be expended by the association that belongs to any state except Nebraska."</p>
<p>Mr. Lindsey said the success of the great undertaking was already assured, as with an empire to back the scheme, it could not fail of glorious achievement.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">MISSOURI AND THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">Liberal Provision for a State Display Urged on the Legislature.</head>
<ab>St. Louis Republic.</ab>
<p>The visit to St. Louis of the committee of Omaha citizens in behalf of the Transmississippi and International Exposition is a timely reminder of the importance of taking energetic steps to secure adequate representation at the exposition for St. Louis and Missouri.</p>
<p>It was at the Omaha meeting of the Transmississippi Commercial congress that the idea of holding a great exposition of the products, industries and civilization of the states west of the Mississippi river was started. A resolution <choice><sic>indorsing</sic><corr>endorsing</corr></choice> the project was presented by William J. Bryan, who was presiding over the congress, and was adopted with enthusiastic unanimity. Omaha was selected as the location of the exposition.</p>
<p>Great credit is due the citizens of Omaha for the liberal and enterprising spirit which has marked their efforts to meet the heavy labor and responsibility placed upon them in preparing for the fair event. From the day of its inception the scope of the enterprise has steadily grown. Beginning with $300,000 and the Board of Directors of the exposition has determined to raise $1,000,000, the full limit of the amount authorized by the charter. The success of Omaha's part in the project is assured.</p>
<p>There are excellent prospects that the states interested in the exposition will do their full share toward realizing its purpose. Appropriations for exhibits are expected in all of the transmississippi states. Congress has appropriated $200,000 for a government exhibit and a bill is pending for $300,000 more. Foreign nations have been invited to participate.</p>
<p>St. Louis is the metropolis and Missouri is the empire state of the region to be represented at the exposition. In this vast region no city equal St. Louis in wealth and importance and no state equals Missouri in richness and variety of resources. More than any other transmississippi city and state they exhibit the wonderful development of the region and are more conspicuously than others the immediate heirs of the future. Their part in the exposition should be that of leadership and pre-eminence in display.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that the Missouri general assembly will deal liberally in making provision for the state's display and that citizens of both St. Louis and the rest of the state will go vigorously to work to secure representation that will be worthy of the commanding importance of the commonwealth in the transmississippi country.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">MINNESOTA'S RESPONSE.</head>
<head type="sub">Acceptance of the Invitation to Participate in the Exposition.</head>
<ab>Minneapolis Times.</ab>
<p>It goes without saying that Minnesota will be adequately represented at the Transmississippi Exposition, which is to be held in Omaha in 1898. Congress has already appropriated $200,000 for the purpose of a government exhibit, building and proper supervision thereof. The act of congress authorizing the government exhibit provides for the exhibition from the executive departments of the United States, the "Smithsonian institution, the United States Fish commission and the National museum, such articles and materials as illustrate the functions and administrative faculty of the government in time of peace, and its resources as a war power, tending to demonstrate the nature of our institutions and their adaption to the wants of the people; that such exposition shall be national, as well as international, in its character, in which the people of the United States, of Mexico, of the Central and South American states, and of the states of the old world, shall be invited to participate. Medals, with appropriate devices; emblems and inscriptions, commemorative of said Transmississippi and International Exposition, and of the awards to be made to the exhibitors, will be prepared at some mint of the United States for the Board of Directors. Articles imported from foreign countries for the sole purpose of exhibition, upon which there shall be a tariff or customs duty, will be admitted free of payment of duty, customs fees or charges. Regulations governing entries for foreign goods <unclear reason="folded">ded</unclear> for exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition have been issued by Secretary Carlisle. The regulations are almost identical with those in force during the Atlanta exposition."</p>
<p>The vice president of the Transmississippi Exposition for Minnesota is our popular Minneapolitan Frank H. Peavey, whose enterprise and energy are a guarantee that the interests of the state will be well cared for in this connection. The managers of the exposition are all men of intelligence and executive ability, who enjoy the public confidence in the highest degree. The state of Nebraska proposes to expend not less than $350,000, while the railroads traversing the state an the citizens and corporations of Omaha propose to contribute not less than $1,000,000 more. Illinois is taking hold of the matter with vigor and enthusiasm and other states in the transmississippi region are actively interesting themselves in the success of the great undertaking.</p>
<p>Minnesota will give the Transmississippi Exposition liberal encouragement. Its interests could not be in better hands than those of Mr. Peavey, whose character for public spirit and liberality will inspire confidence in the enterprise. Mr. Peavey has already taken hold of it with characteristic energy and has invited the co-operation of every man in the state who has anything to exhibit.</p>
<p>The invitation should meet with a ready response, in order that the undertaking may assume practical form at once for submission to the legislature now in session, in order that the requisite state aid may be secured. It is important to Minnesota that her magnificent resources, and the unsurpassed inducements she has to offer settlers and investors, should be properly represented and advertised. Every man who is proud of his state and who believes in her capabilities and her future will be glad of the opportunity to encourage her co-operation in the Transmississippi Exposition.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">NOT SAYING A WORD</head>
<head type="sub">EXPOSITION DIRECTORS ARE SILENT</head>
<head type="sub">Not Inclined to Express Opinions on Legislative Appropriation.</head>
<head type="sub">HOUSE BILL'S OBJECTIONABLE FEATURES</head>
<head type="sub">Hope that the Senate May Amend the Measure.</head>
<head type="sub">$100,000 IS CONSIDERED INSUFFICIENT</head>
<head type="sub">Urged that the Conditions of the Bill Would Delay Action Upon the Part of the State Commission.</head>
<p>The news that the legislature of Nebraska had given a positive sign of what might be expected in the way of an appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition was received in Omaha with feelings of mixed <choice><sic>rejocing</sic><corr>rejoicing</corr></choice> and disappointment. Rejoicing that the friends and supporters of the bill had succeeded in getting a substantial majority vote on any appropriation and disappointment that the bill was encumbered in such a way as to render its effect upon the exposition nugatory rather than helpful. There was a wide divergence of opinion on the street as to the effect the enactment of such a law would have upon the exposition. Many were of the opinion that the appropriation was made almost useless by the many conditions with which the bill is now encumbered and the opinion was freely expressed that such an appropriation was no better than none at all. On the other hand a number of persons expressed the opinion that the senate could be relied on to amend the house bill in such a way as to remove the most objectionable features and increase the amount of the appropriation. This would require concurrence by the house, but these persons were of the opinion that this might be secured.</p>
<p>The greatest objection to the bill was of the score of the amount of the appropriation and on the provision requiring $250,000 to be paid in by the stockholders before the appropriation of $100,000 is available. It was urged that the latter provision was objectionable chiefly for the reason that it would delay action on the part of the state commission, as it would be difficult to collect this amount on the stock subscriptions before the latter part of the current year.</p>
<p>A number of the directors of the exposition were asked their opinion on the bill as it now stands, an they were a unit in expression the hope that the bill would be amended in the senate in such a manner as to remove its most objectionable features. None of the directors would express themselves as to what would be done in case the bill should become a law in its present shape. In answer to all interrogatories on this point they simply repeated the hope that the bill would be amended in the senate.</p></div2>

<p>The Department of Exhibits of the exposition is congratulating itself over the manner in which applications for space for exhibits are being made.

<head type="sub">WOOSTER LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION</head>
<head type="sub">Speaker Gaffin Champions the Bill from the Floor of the House.</head>
<head type="sub">LIE PASSED FROM HORNER TO WOOSTER</head>
<head type="sub">Committee of the Whole, After Completing the Bill, Rises and Orders it Engrossed for the Third Reading.</head>
    <div3>
<p>LINCOLN, Feb. 25.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;At 12:30 this morning the house of representatives, in committee of the whole, voted to rise with the recommendation that the Transmississippi Exposition bill, which has been under consideration all day, be ordered engrossed for a third reading.</p>
<p>The bill, as agreed upon, carries an appropriation of $100,000, half the amount in the measure as originally introduced. An amendment was adopted that no money should be paid until at least $250,000 had been paid in by Omaha stockholders.</p>
<p>There was a continued fight led by Wooster to defeat the measure. At one time, late in the evening, Horner gave the lie to Wooster, and the house was in an uproar. At 12:45 the house adjourned.</p>
<p>Only sixty-three members answered to roll coll yesterday morning, and there were many yawning seats. There were not enough present to suspend the reading of the journal and, although the hour set for further consideration of the exposition bill, 10:15 had arrived, fully fifteen minutes were wasted on the house journal.</p>
<p>Jenkins objected to the record of the journal because it shows that no motion had been made yesterday to go into committee of the whole, but that the speaker had resolved the house into committee on his own motion.</p>
<p>Clark of Richardson attempted to smooth matters over by a motion that the house now go into committee of the whole to consider house roll No. 93, the exposition bill.</p>
<p>Pollard of Cass asked unanimous consent to send in a petition for an appropriation to the exposition. Wooster of Merrick objected, and the petition was not read. Clark withdrew his motion temporarily on the point of order that the house journal had not been approved. This was done and Clark renewed his motion, asking to be excused from taking the chair. Felker of Douglas sent up a resolution that the opponents of the exposition bill be given one hour and the friends of the measure twenty minutes in which to discuss the question. Felker's resolution received no second, and the chairman announced consideration of house roll No. 93 in order.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WAS NEWS TO EASTMAN.</head>
<p>Eastman of Custer broke the ice. His remarks were in the nature of rising to a question of privilege, and he read from the World-Herald a statement from his own county to the effect that the Custer County Agricultural society had voted to endorse a liberal appropriation for the exposition. This, he said, was news to him. He then made a very bitter, though rambling speech against the bill.</p>
<p>Snyder of Sherman spoke in favor of an appropriation, but did not favor the maximum amount. He thought that $100,000 would be a sufficient sum for an appropriation.</p>
<p>Loomis of Butler was of the opinion that something radical was necessary for the benefit of the state. The condition of the state treasury was deplorable. Individually and collectively we are in debt. "Grant," he said, "that the exposition is held. Grant that Nebraska is unrepresented. What of it? Would not eastern financiers believe in the honesty of the state? True, it would be a radical move to refuse this appropriation, but something radical was needed."</p>
<p>Sheldon of Dawes said that there was but one question before the house this morning. Should the bill be killed or should it not? He wished to say at the outset that he was more in favor of the committee's bill, for $150,000, than he was for the substitute offered by Speaker Gaffin, for $200,000. But the main question was, Should we vote a dollar? He said he had gone somewhat into the mathematics of the question and had discovered that wherever such expositions had been held the states that held them had been materially benefited. A reasonable appropriation could not fail to advance the prosperity of Nebraska. But he wanted proper safeguards thrown around the dispensing of any sum that might be voted. The exposition was not to be a hippodrome, but an enterprise of lasting benefit to the state.</p>
<p>Eighmy of Brown was not willing to vote $200,000. The wards of the state should first be taken care of. He, himself, purposed to vote for the retention of the Soldier's and Sailors' home at Milford. This was in the face of the report of the committee, but he would stand there if he stood alone on the floor of the house.</p>
<p>Clark of Lancaster moved that the committee rise, report progress and ask leave to sit again this afternoon, and the motion prevailed. The committee rose, reported, the report was adopted and the house took a recess until 2 p. m.</p>
<p>At 2:15 p. m. the house convened and the subcommittee, Hull, Gerdes and Burkett appointed by the speaker to investigate the affairs of the state treasury reported.</p>
<p>After the report of the subcommittee had been adopted and the committee discharged Pollard of Cass moved that the house now go into committee of the whole to consider house roll No. 93, the exposition bill, which had been made the special order of the day. Speaker Gaffin asked for a ruling of the chair as to whether or not the motion for indefinite postponement of the bill, made yesterday, still held good from committee to committee. Chairman Burkett ruled that each committee was a body by itself and that all motions died with it.</p>
<p>Speaker Gaffin then moved that the substitute for the bill, appropriation $200,000 to the exposition, be taken up and discussed section by section. Winslow of Gosper moved an amendment that when the committee rise it report the bill for indefinite postponement. The question thus went to the house.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">JENKINS ROASTS OMAHA.</head>
<p>Jenkins got the floor first. He said he didn't object so much to the exposition as he did to the fact that Omaha was going to benefit so largely by it. He considered the argument that Kansas City would secure the exposition if Omaha failed to get it a good one against the exposition. Jenkins failed to elucidate this point very clearly, but he did emphasize the fact that he had it in for Omaha.</p>
<p>Hill of Clay spoke for $100,000. He had found that this was about the sum his people wanted him to vote for.</p>
<p>Stebbins of Lincoln opposed the motion for indefinite postponement. He had heard too many members say that they were willing to give $100,000 to permit them to be put down by a motion for indefinite postponement. Such an action would not be fair to the conservative supporters of the exposition. Politically, he did not believe the republicans could manipulate the enterprise to their advantage. Mr. Stebbins said that the west had not forgotten the gift of $250,000 two years ago. Now there were many poor people in Omaha who needed work. The exposition would assist them. The people of his county up in the sand hills were willing to help Omaha at this time.</p>
<p>Jones of Gage said he was not in favor of postponing the bill, but it should be got out of the way somehow. It was blocking the business of the house. His constituents in Gage county were in favor of an appropriation.</p>
<p>When Jones sat down there were several calls of "question," but Eager of Seward, got the floor. He dwelt long on the fact that while railroads and other corporations could put up the price of their tickets, freight schedules and commodities when they so desired the poor or the rich farmer was obliged to take for his products whatever he could get. He hauled his stuff to town and asked the question, "What will you give for it?"</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WOOSTER OPENS HIMSELF.</head>
<p>At the conclusion of Eager's address, Wooster moved up in front of the clerk's desk, carrying a bundle of books under his arm. He then proceeded to whoop things up. He said, while admitting that the exposition would build up Omaha, the building up of Omaha would pull down other cities in the state. Lately it had come to his knowledge that the railroads of Nebraska were against the exposition. The reason for this was plain. There would be an attempt made to reduce passenger traffic to 1 cent a mile. The roads could not afford to do business on that basis. The building up of Omaha must be done at the expense of the railroads and every merchant in the interior of the state.</p>
<p>Wooster struck a snag when he opened out on Hull. Hull is chairman of the committee on investigation of the treasury. Wooster insinuated that a report of the committee had been held back on account of this exposition bill. Hull called him down and denied it. Wooster equivocated, and said he had not referred to Hull's committee, but to another one. Wheeler of Furnas, arose and said he was chairman of the other committee and he denied point black the assertions of Wooster. The latter was in a hole. He attempted to extricate himself by defiantly reiterating his charges. Working himself into a white heat Wooster declared that the proposition to hold a fair in Omaha was a blow at labor. All wages would go down in the face of competition and great suffering would ensue on account of the exposition. Because the committee at Omaha had prepared the original bill, the members were ridiculed. Because its provisions had not met with Wooster's approval they were charged with deceit. The substitute offered by Speaker Gaffin had been prepared by Judge C. R. Scott and Congressman

<pb n="109" xml:id="TMISB02-109"/>

Stark, both free silver republicans. This was for the purpose of catching suckers. Everything had been done in an underhanded manner, and all for the purpose of deception.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">ON CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS.</head>
<p>Again, there was no warrant in the constitution for this measure. He defied any lawyer on the floor to show that the money could be given to Omaha constitutionally. All other appropriation bills had been held up in order that the members of the house might violate their oaths and defy the constitution. "If we vote for this bill," he shouted, "there should be extra cells and extra suits of stripes made ready for us out at the state penitentiary."</p>
<p>The speaker then made some statements to the effect that the appropriations and claims bills would overrun the amount that could be constitutionally levied. Members of both the finance, ways and means and claims committees called Wooster down on his extravagant assertions and practically flooded him. Then the antagonist of the exposition raised the question of meeting the funding bonds due April 1, 1897. According to his story the state treasurer had informed him that the money was, as shown by the books in his office, in the state depository banks. But there was no record that the money was there.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">LOOKS FOR INFORMATION.</head>
<p>Sheldon of Dawes had questioned the statements of Wooster concerning the appropriations to be made by the committees. Wooster then sent down by a page a question to Treasurer Meserve asking him to state whether or not there was actually any money in the depository banks. When the page reappeared the treasurer appeared to have ignored this question, but sent back a statement that the probable amount that would be appropriated by the finance, ways and means committee was $1,250,000, and by the claims committee $400,000, a total of $1,650,000. This incited Wooster to remark that the answer was entirely unsatisfactory. Wooster then became defiant. He charged that if the amendment of Winslow to indefinitely postpone the bill was voted down, it would be impossible to fix up the amended exposition bill so that it could be acted upon within the three days' time allows for the introduction of new bills.</p>
<p>While Wooster was in the midst of his flow of rhetoric, Clark of Lancaster moved that the committee rise, report progress and ask leave to sit again.</p>
<p>Pollard wanted to amend to meet last evening at 7:30.</p>
<p>Clark said as but few days remained for the introduction of bills, it was necessary that the committees had some opportunity to meet. Speaker Gaffin said that it would be a <choice><sic>god</sic><corr>good</corr></choice> idea to meet at night and allow Wooster to "run down."</p>
<p>Wooster flew into a passion at this and roasted the speaker, saying that when he was out of the speaker's chair he had no more rights than any other member and he repelled any such personalities as had been made by the speaker. Opponents of this bill, he said, had been insulted and gagged on the floor long enough. He did not propose to stand it.</p>
<p>Pollard's amendment was lost by a vote of 49 to 39. Clark's original motion was then lost by a vote of 40 to 38, and Wooster had the floor.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WOULD HOLD UP ALL BILLS.</head>
<p>Then he made a startling announcement. It was this: That he proposed to hold this bill up until it was too late to introduce the appropriation bills. But he had a proposition to make. He was willing to have the bill referred back to the committee. If the house would agree to take up the bill next Wednesday he would consent to allow the house to go on and transact business. For the present he would yield the floor.</p>
<p>Yeiser of Douglas challenged Wooster's proposition on the constitutionality of the bill. He said it was perfectly lawful and constitutional. There were bills pending, he said, taxing express, telegraph and telephone companies which would bring in much more than the $200,000 asked by the bill.</p>
<p>The question was then upon Winslow's motion to indefinitely postpone. It was defeated by a vote of 63 to 16.</p>
<p>Wooster moved that the bill be recommitted to the committee from which it came, and made another speech. He said it was addressed mainly to the reporters. If he understood the intent of the majority, they proposed to hold up all other legislation until this bill was carried. They exhibited an inclination to sacrifice the interests of the wards and people of the state in behalf of the exposition bill. He said he was willing to modify his demand from Wednesday to Monday next for the consideration of it. He believed the opponents of the bill would stand by him.</p>
<p>Jenkins of Jefferson, one of the opponents, said he was a free lance and would enter into no agreement with Wooster on anything. This was a decided snub to Wooster and he did not seem to relish it. Speaker Gaffin then proceed to cinch Wooster by suggesting that the house could save the time that Wooster was trying to waste by taking a recess from day to day instead of adjourning. By this means the plot of Wooster could be foiled.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">IN A PARLIAMENTARY WAR.</head>
<p>Smith of Douglas was heartily in favor of the suggestion made by Speaker Gaffin. The question should be met and met now.</p>
<p>Gaylord, who had been mute all the afternoon, now accused Smith of having caused all the delay, and a wordy war ensued. Clark renewed his motion to rise and report progress. Pollard moved an amendment to make the hour 7:30 this evening. Pollard was downed by a point of order that the question had once been voiced down. Question recurred on Clark's motion to rise. This was defeated by a vote of fifty-five against it.</p>
<p>The question was now on Wooster's motion to recommit the bill for amendment. This was defeated by a vote of fifty-two against it.</p>
<p>Clark of Richardson then moved that the committee rise and ask leave to sit this evening at 7:30 for consideration of the bill. The motion was lost by a vote of 49 to 39.</p>
<p>Clark then moved to rise and sit again at 10 a. m. today with the bill a special order. Jenkins said the motion was cowardly. Chairman Burkett declared the motion carried, and the committee rose and reported.</p>
<p>Cronk of Valley moved that the report be not concurred in, but that the house come back in the evening at 7:30 and fight it out. This was amended, making the hour 9 a. m. today and was defeated. Roll call was demanded on the motion to non-concur in the report, but to meet at 7:30 last evening, and it prevailed by a vote of 50 to 47. It was not 6:30 p. m. and the house took a recess until 7:30 p. m. last evening.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">OFFERING AMENDMENTS.</head>
<p>Speaker Gaffin called the evening session together at 8:15, three-quarters of an hour behind time. Including those absent on committee work, eighty-seven answered to roll call. Speaker Gaffin said the hour had arrived to go into committee of the whole on the special order. Pollard moved to instruct the committee to limit speeches to twenty minutes. Phelps' motion to table was lost. Pollard's motion prevailed and the house went into committee of the whole, with Burkett in the chair.</p>
<p>Jenkins moved the adoption of an amendment to section 2 of Gaffin's substitute bill, that six of the directors named in the substitute bill be drawn from the ranks of organized labor. This was ruled out of order and Gaffin again presented his substitute bill, and then Jenkins renewed his amendment. Considerable jangling occurred over the fact that Gaffin's substitute had not been printed, until Faggin explained that his bill was simply an amendment to the original bill which was printed and in the members' files. The question was on Jenkin's amendment, and he got the floor and made a speech in support of it.</p>
<p>Clark of Richardson opposed the amendment. He thought three members of organized labor enough.</p>
<p>Clark of Lancaster took the opposite view. He believed the organized labor of Nebraska should have strength enough on the directory to shut out labor competition from other states.</p>
<p>Jenkins' amendment was lost, and Sutton moved an amendment that the governor should appoint six instead of twelve directors, one from each congressional district, which prevailed.</p>
<p>Wimberley of Lancaster moved an amendment that no member of this legislature be named as one of the directors. The amendment carried.</p>
<p>Zimmerman moved an amendment that the Board of Public Lands and Buildings be named instead of six directors to make the <choice><sic>constracts</sic><corr>contracts</corr></choice> and carry on the work.</p>
<p>Speaker Gaffin opposed this. The burden of the cry of the board for fifteen years had been that it had too much work of this kind to attend to. Zimmerman's amendment went by the board and Wiebe of Hall moved to make its pay $100 per month instead of $50. This was lost.</p>
<p>Casebeer of Gage moved that the directors be compelled to give a bond of $10,000 each for the faithful performance of their duty. Speaker Gaffin explained that further reading of the bill would disclose that a check on the directors was laid in the lands of the governor. Casebeer's motion was lost by a vote of 35 to 24.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">CUTS DOWN THE AMOUNT.</head>
<p>The reading of section 4, naming $200,000 as the amount of the appropriation, brought twenty men to their feet with amendments in their hands and shouting "Mr. Chairman." Billings of Keya Paha was recognized. His amendment was to make the appropriation $100,000.</p>
<p>Yeiser asked if any other amendments had been sent up naming other amounts. He was answered in the affirmative. Then he said that all rules of parliamentary usage demanded that the amendment favoring the largest sum be acted upon first.</p>
<p>Chairman Burkett said that the amendment would not be entertained. Speaker Gaffin asked unanimous consent to permit the largest amount to be voted on first. Wooster objected. He wanted Billings' amendment voted on first, and if it carried, let that fix the amount of the bill, if it should be defeated, he wanted that to be taken as killing the bill. This was an unfair opposition, and he was told so in plain terms by Yeiser.</p>
<p>A long wrangle occurred over this, and Wooster, who had objected to Gaffin's suggestion, withdrew his objection, with the understanding that $25,000 drops he had until a certain amount was carried. But Billings insisted that as he had accidentally got his amendment in first, it should first be voted on. The chair held that Billings amendment was in order, and called for a vote on the $100,000 amount. But he qualified this by stating that all the amendments offered should be voted on.</p>
<p>The vote on Billings' amendment carried by 71 ayes. Billings then moved that the committee rise and report progress. The motion was lost.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">KILLING OFF OTHER AMENDMENTS.</head>
<p>Clark of Richardson and Fouke of Gage had motions to amend by inserting $150,000. Clark's amendment was lost by a vote of 55 to 28. Grell's amendment for $125,000 was next in order and was lost by a large majority.</p>
<p>Wimberley of Lancaster tried to move that the committee rise, but he was howled down. Then Winslow's amendment for $75,000 was brought to a vote and defeated by a vote of 62 to 20. Eager's amendment to insert $50,000 in place of $100,000 was lost and Pollard tried to get the house to rise and report progress. The motion to rise was defeated.</p>
<p>Cronk moved an amendment that no money should be paid to any superintendent not employed by the Board of Directors, said superintendent to put in all his time on the exposition, and all superintendents to be taken from the districts on all equal basis. This amendment was defeated. The opponents of the bill, having failed, became obstructionists. They were full of schemes for safeguarding the money. Gaylord was one, Jenkins another and Wooster a third. Jenkins accused Horner of being a late convert. Horner declared that a falsehood. There was great confusion, but Chairman Burkett succeeded at last in securing order.</p>
<p>Clark of Lancaster's amendment that no money should be paid until at least $250,000 had been paid in by Omaha stockholders prevailed.</p>
<p>Liddell's motion that all unskilled labor should be paid at the rate of $1.50 per day carried.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">KNOCKS WOOSTER OUT AGAIN.</head>
<p>Wooster moved to stroke out section 5 entirely. The section provides that the state directors shall act in conjunction with the Board of Directors of the exposition. He asserted that there was a colored man concealed in the section and that it covered a scheme to turn the whole appropriation over to the Omaha people.</p>
<p>Speaker Gaffin resented the imputation and defended the section vigorously. Wooster's motion was defeated overwhelmingly.</p>
<p>Wooster then moved to strike out section 6 entirely, but did not press his motion, and the section was agreed to.</p>
<p>Section 7 was agreed to with but a mild protest from Wooster.</p>
<p>Section 8 was agreed to and the bill thus completed.</p>
<p>Hill of Clay offered an entirely new section, providing that the property acquired by the state may be sold by the commissioner of public lands and buildings within sixty days after the close of the exposition.</p>
<p>Wooster favored the new section, but for once Jenkins took the other side. The latter wanted the building to stand as a monument to the extravagance of the legislature. Gaffin favored the section. It was adopted.</p>
<p>The bill was finally completed, but Wooster arose to a final question of privilege. He repeated his charge made earlier in the day that one night he occupied the same room with Horner of Dawson and on that occasion the latter stated that he (Horner) was opposed to the exposition bill.</p>
<p>Horner denounced the statement as an underqualified falsehood and turning to Wooster he said with emphasis as he shouted: "Is that plain enough?"</p>
<p>"No," replied Wooster.</p>
<p>"Well," said Horner, "you are a liar."</p>
<p>The house was in an uproar. Wooster asked the chairman if a member could call another a liar. The chair asked the gentlemen to refrain from personalities. Order was finally restored, and then, at 12:30, the committee rose with the recommendation that the bill should be ordered engrossed for a third reading.</p>
<p>The report was adopted without opposition.</p>
<p>Sheldon then moved that the house take a recess until 10:30 (Thursday) morning. Although he did not say so, his object was to save an extra day for the benefit of the ways and means committee. The motion was fought hard, and after several excited remarks Shelden's motion was lost. Clark of Lancaster then moved that the house adjourn. Sheldon insisted on debate, but was shut off by a point of order.</p>
<p>The house then, at 12:45, adjourned, and the long fight over the exposition bill in the house was ended.</p>

<head type="sub">Members of Board of Lady Managers Are Elected at Fremont.</head>
<ab>Members of Board of Lady Managers&#8212;</ab>
<ab>MRS. D. C. GIFFERT of West Point.</ab>
<ab>MRS. NETTIE KNOX HOLLENBECK of Fremont.</ab>
<p>FREMONT, Feb. 24.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The women of the Third congressional district met at Masonic hall at 10:30 this morning in mass convention and selected Mrs. D. C. Giffert of West Point and Mrs. Nettie Knox Hollenbeck of Fremont as members of the Board of Lady Managers of the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
    <p>About 160 women were present. With the exception of a small delegation from West point and a number of young women from the Fremont normal school, all were from Fremont. The meeting was at times lively, much interest and partisanship being shown among the supporters of the various candi<!--<pb n="111" xml:id="TMISB02-111"/>-->dates. It did not differ much from a political convention except in showing a lack of knowledge of parliamentary law and an attempt to run things to suit their particular ends. Of the three candidate from Fremont, Mrs. W. H. Clemmons, wife of President Clemmons of the Fremont Normal school, had her forces most completely in line and her plans most carefully laid. Mrs. Nettie K. Hollendbeck, who finally received the appointment, had the support of the Woman's club and Charity club. Mrs. Edwards had the support of no organization and was not an active candidate for the position, but nevertheless made an unexpectedly strong showing.</p>
        <p>In the absence of mayor Fried, Mrs. H. G. Wolcott, president of the woman's club, called the meeting to order. Mrs. Wolcott and Mrs. Adelaide Reynolds were nominated for permanent president, and Mrs. Reynolds declining, Mrs. Wolcott was elected by acclamation. Miss Vesta Gray was chosen permanent secretary. A circular letter was then read by the president defining the powers and duties of the members to be elected. The meeting then voted that formal nominations be made and that no woman under 18 be allowed to vote. The name of Mrs. D. C. Giffert of West Point was then presented by Mrs. Nettie K. Hollenbeck of Fremont. Mrs. Edward Blewett in a lengthy written speech nominated Mrs. W. H. Clemmons of Fremont. Mrs. R. L. Hammond, in a short concise talk, presented the name of Mrs. Nettie K. Hollenbeck. Mrs. A. M. Edwards was placed in nomination by Mrs. F. M. Sisson.</p>
        <p>The first ballot was then taken, which resulted as follows: Mrs. Hollenbeck, 46; Mrs. Edwards, 48; Mrs. Clemmons, 61; no election. The meeting then attempted to adjourn till 1:30, but the women were anxious to get through and the motion was defeated. A second ballot was taken amid much excitement.  It resulted as follows: Mrs. Hollenbeck, 40; Mrs. Clemmons, 58; Mrs. Edwards, 42. The meeting then adjourned to 2 o'clock.</p>
        <p>When the women reconvened this afternoon there were 256 present. After considerable discussion as to the method of balloting it was decided that the third ballot be taken by each woman coming forward and giving her name and address to the tellers with her ballot. It resulted as follows: Mrs. Edwards, 65; Mrs. Clemmons, 98; Mrs. Hollenbeck, 93.</p>
        <p>On the fourth ballot Mrs. Edwards dropped to 46, Mrs. Clemmons had 91 and Mrs. Hollenbeck 89. A motion to adjourn was voted down. Mrs. Edwards withdrew her name, leaving the contest between the two leaders.</p>
        <p>The fifth ballot resulted in the election of Mrs. Hollenbeck, who received 100 votes to 99 for Mrs. Clemmons. The result was greeted by loud cheers by all present and general expressions of satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Nettie Knox Hollenbeck is the wife of Hon. Conrad Hollenbeck of this city. She is a native of Pennsylvania and is a descendent of General Knox of revolutionary fame. She was educated at Phoenix Ladies' seminary, Pennsylvania. She has resided in Fremont for over twenty years and is a leader in social and literary circles. She is a women of great force of character and executive ability.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">Acce<unclear reason="covered"></unclear>to Participate in the Exposition.</head>
<ab>Minneapolis Times.</ab>
<p>It goes without saying that Minnesota will be adequately represented at the Transmississippi Exposition, which is to be held in Omaha in 1898. Congress has already appropriated $200,000 for the purpose of a government exhibit, building and proper supervision thereof. The act of congress authorizing the government exhibit provides for the exhibition from the executive departments of the United States, the "Smithsonian institution, the United States Fish commission and the National museum, such articles and materials as illustrate the functions and administrative faculty of the government in time of peace, and its resources as a war power, tending to demonstrate the nature of our institutions and their adaption to the wants of the people; that such exposition shall be national, as well as international, in its character, in which the people of the United States, of Mexico, of the Central and South American states, and of the states of the old world, shall be invited to participate. Medals, with appropriate devices; emblems and inscriptions, commemorative of said Transmississippi and International Exposition, and of the awards to be made to the exhibitors, will be prepared at some mint of the United States for the Board of Directors. Articles imported from foreign countries for the sole purpose of exhibition, upon which there shall be a tariff or customs duty, will be admitted free of payment of duty, customs fees or charges. Regulations governing entries for foreign goods intended for exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition have been issued by Secretary Carlisle. The regulations are almost identical with those in force during the Atlanta exposition."</p>
<p>The vice president of the Transmississippi Exposition for Minnesota is our popular Minneapolitan Frank H. Peavey, whose enterprise and energy are a guarantee that the interest of the state will be well cared for in this connection. The managers of the exposition are all men of intelligence and executive ability, who enjoy the public confidence in the highest degree. The state of Nebraska proposes to expend not less than $350,000, while the railroads traversing the state and the citizens  and corporations of Omaha propose to contribute not less than $1,000,000 more. Illinois is taking hold of the matter with vigor and enthusiasm and other states in the transmississippi region are actively interesting themselves in the success of the great undertaking.</p>
<p>Minnesota will give the Transmississippi Exposition liberal encouragement. Its interests could not be in better hands than those of Mr. Peavey, whose character for public spirit and liberality will inspire confidence in the enterprise. Mr. Peavey has already taken hold of it with characteristic energy and has invited the co-operation of every man in the state who has anything to exhibit.</p>
<p>The invitation should meet with a ready response, in order that the undertaking may assume practical form at once for submission to the legislature now in session, in order that the requisite state aid may be secured. It is important to Minnesota that her magnificent resources, and the unsurpassed inducements she has to offer settlers and investors, should be properly represented and advertised. Every man who is proud of his state and who believes in her capabilities and her future will be glad of the opportunity to encourage her co-operation in the Transmississippi Exposition.</p></div2>

<head>THE HOUSE EXPOSITION</head>
    <p>The exposition bill as it has been recommended to pass the h<unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> in full below. The bill bears the same title as that attached to <unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> when it was originally introduced. The new title, in conformi<unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> will be attached when the bill comes up for final passage in the <unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> bill is as follows:</p>
    <p>Whereas, There is to be held at the city of Omaha, in the <unclear reason="cut off">braska,</unclear> in the year 1898, an exposition known as the Trans-Mississippi International exposition, participated in by many western states,</p>
    <p>Whereas, The said exposition had its origin in a resolution adopted at a former session of the Trans-Mississippi congress pa<unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> by all the states west of the Mississippi river, and was designed<unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> and develop western interests, and,</p>
    <p>Whereas, The congress of the United States has passed a <unclear reason="cut off">ing</unclear> and encouraging the holding of said exposition and making a <unclear reason="cut off">tion</unclear> to provide for an exhibit by the United States government position in a building to be constructed by the federal government.</p>
    <p>Whereas, A corporation with a proper capital has been du<unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> under the laws of the state of Nebraska to carry on the business a<unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> exposition and is now proceeding with the work of preparation <unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> exposition may be held from June to November in the year 1898, a<unclear reason="cut off"></unclear></p>
    <p>Whereas, The location of said exposition at the city of Omaha <unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> state of Nebraska, has afforded to this state an auspicious op<unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> exhibit its own resources and products in said exposition, and <unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> state to secure great and lasting benefits as a result of the comi<unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> visitors from other states, and,</p>
<p>Whereas, This opportunity is one which will enable the people to refute in a most effective way the false and detrimental reports <unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> been circulated concerning the state, and to demonstrate to all <unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> great natural wealth and varied resources of Nebraska, and,</p>
<p>Whereas, Homeseekers and investors can by means of this <unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> attracted in large numbers to Nebraska, and,</p>
<p>Whereas, Private enterprise alone cannot adequately provide <unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> capital for this great public undertaking by which the whole s<unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> largely benefited.</p>
<p>Therefore, Be it enacted by the legislature of the state of Ne<unclear reason="cut off"></unclear></p>
<p>Section 1. That the state of Nebraska take part in the Transmississippi and International exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898 as her<unclear reason="cut off">vided</unclear>.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That the governor of the state of Nebraska be and is authorized and directed to appoint a state board of directors of s<unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> consisting of one representative citizen from each congressional <unclear reason="cut off"></unclear> the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this act. Provided <unclear reason="cut off">bers</unclear> of the present legislature shall be eligible of directors so appo<unclear reason="cut off"></unclear></p>
<p>Sec. 3.

                <head type="sub">The Sum Appropriated by the State</head>
                <head type="sub">Legislature for the Trans-Mississippi</head>
                <head type="sub">Exposition&#8212;The Bill Has the Gaffin</head>
                <head type="sub">Amendment Hooked to It&#8212;Other Changes.</head>
                <p>LINCOLN, Neb., Feb. 24.&#8212;The Transmississippi bill was <choice><sic>recomended</sic><corr>recommended</corr></choice> by the house committee of the whole for passage tonight, and at a few minutes before 1 o'clock, after a hard fight which lasted since Tuesday afternoon the house order-the bill engrossed for third reading. The bill, as it will come up for final passage, that being the next step, is the Gaffin amendment with some changes.</p>
                <p>These changes fix the amount of the appropriation at $100,000, no part of the money to be available until $200,000 has been paid in by the stockholders of the Transmississippi Exposition association on their subscriptions.</p>
                <p>Fifteen thousand dollars are to be set apart for the state board of agriculture, the Horticulture society and the state Dairymen's association and the manufacturing interests of the state.</p>
                <p>A minimum wage to be paid unskilled laborers at $1.50 per day.</p>
                <p>The number of state directors is reduced from twelve to six.</p>
                <p>Some other changes are made.</p>
                <p>The above news from Lincoln is enough to disgust us all though it has been feared for several weeks. A hundred thousand dollar appropriation by the state for the exposition is nothing less than an insult to every business enterprise in its dominions and the generosity shown toward the project by the United States government and other states. For the first time Nebraska is on the threshold of an opportunity to be the cynosure of the world's investors, to display the great natural resources and the wealth producing qualities she possesses, to those who make great states and settlements; and to be rejuvenated and strengthened not only by the capital that will be induced to come here in the <choice><sic>usula</sic><corr>usual</corr></choice> channels of investments by the display we may make but also by the great mass of money that under favorable circumstances would be expended here during the following twenty months. This latter item itself would prove a stimulus that would work a heroic change in our finances and business activity, and give us a renewed hope, and a resurrection from the bog of hard times despondency we have floundered in for three years, and start us successfully on the voyage of prosperity upon which the country is now about to be embarked. If the opportunity is not taken it will cast a stigma on the activity of the state that decades will be required in wiping out; it will give us the horse laugh in every attempt we make to attract investors and settlers, and relegate the state to that class of push and energy which denies recognition as a part of the great system of American enterprise which in the last one hundred years has astonished and overpowered the world. No better way to kill such an opportunity can be found than in the state voting only $100,000 for the exposition. The sum is paltry, mean, contemptible. It is not as much as some township would vote for a railroad or some city for a public building. It is not even a respectable per cent of the magnitude of the proposed enterprise. It is not even as much as certain sister states have proposed giving, though they would not reap a dollar in direct return. It is do disgustingly a trifle that universal ridicule is aroused. The 2-per cent legislators elected by the impulse of insanity in the late election do not in any sense realize the meaning of the exposition. They think it to be but little more than a state fair project and that the place where it is to be held is where the profit will be reaped. They do not know that it is a self-paying advertisement of the state; that it millions of will bring dollars into the state through the gates of Omaha and South Omaha, the same through which all other returns are realized. To them an appropriation of that kind is like a donation to the missionaries of the cannibal islands without the slightest profit making attribute. They do not understand that an appropriation for that purpose is nothing else than taking the money out of one of the state's pockets to put it in another: that all the money expended in making a state exhibit will be among the citizens of the state, in fact a return of what they have paid in by the way of taxes. All in all they are acting without reason like a lot of mangy imbeciles, crazy with the spirit to retrench where there can't be no retrenchment, to reform where there is no necessity. Such an appropriation would be disastrous to the exposition and the state.</p></div2>
            
<div2 type="article"><dateline>OAKLAND ENQUIRER, TUESDAY <lb/> EVENING, FEBRUARY 9, 1897.</dateline>
    <head type="sub">THE OMAHA EXPOSITION.</head>
                <p>In to-day's Enquirer is published some facts of general interest in regard to the Trans-Mississippi Exposition which is to be held at Omaha, commencing June 1st, in which there is to be a co-operation of twenty States and four Territories in bringing to the world's attention the products, manufactures and resources of the vast region of country lying west of the Father of Waters and of which the general public, outside its boundaries, have only the crudest notions. The importance, to Westerners, of opportunities like that of the Omaha exposition cannot be over-estimated. To California this display will be of special value for the reason that the mineral wealth of the extreme western States is to be made prominent to an unusual degree. In many respects the Trans-Mississippi exposition will be of greater <choice><sic>importence</sic><corr>importance</corr></choice>, from a money point of view, than was the Chicago Fair, for the reason that there the immensity of the displays and the fact that this county was brought into competition with the civilized world, rendered a careful study of the exhibits impossible, except with the few who were in position to devote months of time to that purpose. Of course California will make a creditable showing and will receive in return dollars where cents have been expended in that connection.</p>
                <p>Hon. George W. Parsons of Los Angeles is the vice president representing California. In an editorial on this subject the Los Angeles Times recently expressed itself in this vigorous fashion: "California will make a great mistake if she fails to be represented, and that right handsomely, at the Trans-Mississippi Exhibition, to be held at Omaha. All those who visited the World's Fair at Chicago in 1893, testify cheerfully that California's portion of the great show was its most novel feature and as instructive as it was original in character. There is no good reason why a California display at the Omaha fair could not be made as attractive as the one made at Chicago, and be seen by a great many people who were unable to reach the Lake City during the great industrial carnival that stamped her as the most thoroughly <choice><sic>Amrican</sic><corr>American</corr></choice> of all American cities."</p></div2>

                <p>In to-day's Times will be found an article setting out the purposes, scope, prospects, etc., of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, to be held at Omaha next year, beginning June 1st. In this great enterprise twenty States and four Territories are to co-operate and bring to public attention the varied advantages and interests of a region of country unsurpassed in resources and attractiveness by any other portion of the globe. What the New Orleans and Atlanta expositions have been to the South, the one being planned for 1898 is to be to the West. Never in the history of our country has there been a larger amount of idle capital than now, and all that is required to put this money in circulation is to bring in the attention of its owners promising opportunities for investment. Of these the West has an abundance, and the Trans-Mississippi Exposition will make those appropriations known.</p>

<p>Congress had appropriated $200,000 for the purpose of a government <choice><sic>dispay</sic><corr>display</corr></choice>, the citizens of Omaha have raised $400,000, and the State will doubtless vote the appropriation of $300,000 which is asked for by the managers of the enterprise. The business details are in the hands of first class men, the greatest interest is being aroused in the various States and Territories proposing to participate and there can be no question but that the most gratifying results will follow.</p>

<head type="sub">Twenty-Three States and Territories Are to be Represented at Nebraska's Chief City.</head>
<p>Next year there is to be held at Omaha, Nebraska, an exposition in which California is <choice><sic>especially</sic><corr>especially</corr></choice> interested&#8212;the Trans-Mississippi International Exposition to open June 1st and close November 1st. Twenty States and four territories are embraced as the Trans-Mississippi region. These States and territories cover an area of more than two and a half million square miles, with an aggregate population of nearly 25,000,000. They represent fully twenty billions of wealth. They are the great granary of America and contain within their boundaries practically all the gold and silver mines of the United States, beside deposits of iron, copper, lead, zinc and other minerals of incalculable volume and value. They embrace, furthermore, the greatest bodies of timber on the North American continent, as well as a large portion of the cotton belt, and all of the sugar producing lands within the boundaries of the union. The railroads within the Trans-Mississippi States aggregate 65,000 miles and the navigable waterways include the greatest of American rivers&#8212;the Mississippi, Missouri and the Columbia.</p>
<p>In the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 the exhibits of the Trans-Mississippi States were over-shadowed by the exhibits of foreign countries. Of the millions who passed through its gates, comparatively few carried away with them a distinct impression of the productive resources of that vast empire. The purpose of the projectors of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition is to acquaint the nation and visitors from other countries with the fabulous wealth and stupendous possibilities of the greater West.</p>
<p>Before the work of organization had fairly been entered upon, Senator Allen, on January 3, 1896, introduced a bill in the United States Senate granting the Exposition recognition by Congress as an interstate and international exposition, providing for the admission of foreign exhibits free of duty and pledging the United States to expend not less than $250,000 for a government building and exhibit. A similar bill was introduced in the House by Representative Mercer. These bills were finally consolidated in conference at the close of the session, and the bill authorizing $200,000 to be expended for a Federal building and a government exhibit was signed by President Cleveland before Congress adjourned last summer.</p>
<p>Among the conditions embodied in the bill was the provision that not less than $250,000 in bona fide subscriptions and donations must be secured by the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition Association before the Federal appropriation became available. This requirement has been compiled with. The amount of stock subscriptions and donations to the exposition association now exceeds $400,000, and it is confidently believed that it will reach the maximum of $1,000,000 within ninety days. The largest single subscription so far registered is from the Burlington railroad, amounting to $30,000.</p>
<p>The  work of preparation is going forward under the management of some of the leading citizens of Omaha, the following named constituting the officers and executive board: Gurdon W. Wattles, president; ex-Governor Alvin Saunders, vice president; Herman Kountze, president First National Bank, treasurer; John A. Wakefield, secretary; executive committee, Zachary T. Lindsey. Manager Department of Ways and Means; Edward Rosewater, Manager Department of Publicity; Gilbert M. Hitchcock, Manager Department of Buildings and Grounds; Edward E. Bruce, Manager Department of Concessions and Privileges; Wm. N. Babcock, Manager Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>The following named constitute the States which are included in those to be represented in this display of products: Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Nevada, Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Oregon, Idaho, Texas, New Mexico, Indian Territory, Alaska, Oklahoma, Arizona Utah, California, Washington, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Colorado and Kansas.</p>
<p>These States and Territories are represented by the following named vice presidents: Iowa, Hon. George F. Wright., Council Bluffs; South Dakota, Hon. Thomas H. Wells, Hot Springs; Nebraska, Hon. William Neville, North Platte; Missouri, Hon. John Doniphan. St. Joseph; Kansas. Hon. C. A. Fellows. Topeka; Arizona, Hon. Charles R. Drake, Tucson; California. Hon. George W. Parsons, Los Angeles; Texas, Hon. Gus Reymershoffer. Galveston; Oklahoma. Hon. Eugene Wallace. Oklahoma City; Idaho, Hon. B. P. Shawhan, Payette; Nevada. Hon. William J. Westerfield, Reno; Utah, Hon. Lewis W. Shurtliff. Ogden City; Colorado. Hon. Henry P. Steele. Denver; New Mexico, Hon. L. Bradford Price. Santa Fe; Oregon. Hon. B. S. Cook. Salem; Alaska. Governor James Sheakley, Sitka.</p>
<p>Never was there a more creditable display of pluck and enterprise than is shown by the people back of this enterprise, when the terrible financial depression which has prevailed in the West for three years is considered, and they are entitled to the most hearty support and active co-operation on the part of the residents of the great empire whose manifold interests will be advanced by the success of the exposition, the first to be held west of Chicago.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">WILLING TO HELP THE BIG SHOW ALONG</head>
<head type="sub">Exposition Directors Enthusiastic Over the Aid Furnished by the Railroads Centering at Omaha.</head>
<p>Word was received in Omaha this afternoon shortly after 3 o'clock from Marvin Hughitt, president of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern system, embracing the following lines: Northwestern, Chicago, St. Paul &amp; Minneapolis, Fremont, Elkhorn &amp; Missouri Valley, and Sioux City &amp; Pacific railroads, that the contribution of that system to the Transmississippi Exposition would be $30,000.</p>
<p>It has been expected by those most conversant with exposition matter that the Northwestern would soon announce its subscription to the exposition fund, and that the amount would be a most liberal one. The expectations of the management have not been wrong. The amount contributed is equal to that subscribed on the day after Thanksgiving last by the Burlington.</p>
<p>This subscription makes $60,000 that has already been subscribed by two of Omaha's great railroads, or more than half as much as the state of Nebraska has appropriated. It is thought that the announcement of this will have a most beneficial effect on the other railroads and that the many that have as yet not subscribed a cent toward the success of the exposition will now be in a hurry to follow the band wagon.</p>
<p>The announcement was received with the greatest enthusiasm at exposition headquarters. All of the directors who are in the city soon learned of the action of the road, and were loud <choice><sic>ni</sic><corr>in</corr></choice> their praise of President Hughitt's action. The officials at the Elkhorn headquarters and at the local office of the Northwestern road received the congratulations by telephone and special messengers. General Manager Bidwell of the Elkhorn, the highest official of the Northwestern system in the city, is out of the city, so General Solicitor William B. Sterling acted as recipient of the honors of the afternoon. General Agent Kuhn of the Northwestern line proper is out on a trip through the state, but City Passenger Agent West soon learned of the news. He also received many congratulatory calls and messages, and at once prepared to use the fact of the contribution of his railroad for the best advertising purposes.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">J. Woods Smith Does a Little Missionary Work for the Exposition.</head>
<p>J. Woods Smith, now a prominent traveling salesman for a well known Chicago house, was in the city yesterday. Mr. Smith is a pioneer Nebraskan, who has seen about all of the phases of life that the prairie state can afford. He founded and named the town of Callaway, and as at least the godfather and chief owner of Loup City. Twelve years ago Mr. Smith Staked out a town on the virgin prairie and named it Callaway, in honor of S. R. Callaway, superintendent of the Union Pacific. He watched it grow into a good sized town, and then turned his attention to developing the country elsewhere. Mr. Smith has just completed an extensive tour throughout the state, and as a side issue to his business he has undertaken to do what he could to secure a proper sized appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition. He was bitterly disappointed at the action taken at Lincoln Wednesday night. He declares that no one realizes the importance of Nebraska supporting the exposition project with enthusiasm and liberality so much as the men who come into contact with the business interests of the east. All of the big eastern firms with which he is acquainted have declared their opinion that the exposition is the golden opportunity of Nebraska.</p></div2>

<p>The exposition delegation visiting western legislatures was in Portland yesterday, and will be in Olympia, where it will have a meeting with the Washington legislature today. The party will get back to Portland Sunday, and thence will proceed to San Francisco. Whether it will be by rail or ocean steamer has not been decided. It is quite probable that the ladies of the party will not go to San Francisco. The present plan for them is to come back in their car to Salt Lake and wait there until rejoined by the men.</p>
<p>Nothing has been heard from the southern party for two or three days. It is supposed to be at the Mexican capital.</p>
<p>In addition to space asked for an exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi exposition the Chinese News company of Chicago has applied for 18,000 feet for a Chinese village, theater and tea garden.</p>
<p>This feature will be something like the one at the World's fair and the Midwinter show.</p>

<head type="sub">Marcus Daly Makes Possible an Appropriation From the State of Montana.</head>
<head type="sub">No doubt Fifteen Thousand to Be Voted by the Legislature Will Be Doubled by His Personal Check.</head>
<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
<p>Helena, Mont., Feb. 26.&#8212;Unless some one member of the state legislature happens to want to exercise extraordinary power tomorrow when the committee on appropriations of the house asks leave to introduce a bill there is a good prospect that Montana will have an appropriation of $15,000 with which to make an exhibition of her resources at the Trans-Mississippi exposition at Omaha in 1898. On top of that amount or whatever amount the legislature may finally agree to give will be a like amount from Marcus Daly of the Anaconda company, who is a millionaire and never does things by halves. The appropriation committee did not at first intend to recommend an appropriation above a small amount to pay a man to gather subscriptions throughout the state from private sources, but Mr. Daly called up one of the members over the telephone from Butte and told him that he would add an equal amount to the appropriation of the state. So, although retrenchment has been the constant cry of the members, the committee found a strong sentiment in favor of giving at least the amount named and I will introduce this bill.</p>
<p>The state constitution provides that no appropriation bill can be introduced within ten days of the end of the session unless by unanimous consent. The friends of the exposition here say that while there will be some opposition to the passage of the bill, none of the opponents will object to this introduction of the measure as far as known. It is also stated with confidence that if the bill goes in it will pass. The bill will also provide for a commission to not only expend the money and superintend the exhibit, but to co-operate with such organizations of business men as may be organized as individuals to make displays. There will be a mining exhibit from other than official sources, the mining men of Helena alone being aroused to the importance of the event from the standpoint of an advertisement to the state. Mr. Daly's subscription, he said, can go into the state fund and be expended by the commission. The appropriation is in two blocks, $5,000 to be expended in 1897 and the remaining $10,000 <unclear reason="covered"></unclear></p></div2>

<p>Chicago, Ill., Feb. 25.&#8212;Mr. Z. T. Lindsey, Chairman Executive Committee Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, Omaha&#8212;Dear Sir: Chicago &amp; Northwestern system of roads will subscribe $30,000 to the full paid capital stock of the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898. Payment on account thereof to be made as assessments are called by the proper authority of the incorporation. This subscription is made on the express understanding and with the right reserved to the company to make this sum a donation and not to accept the stock of the association. Very truly yours, MARVIN HUGHITT, President.</p>
<p>Clarence M. Jones of Columbus O., a son of the former partner of F. P.

He believes that a subscription is a good investment for non-resident property holders whether their property is in the city or elsewhere in the state.</p>
<p>Olympia, Wash., Feb. 26.&#8212;Exposition delegation reached Olympia, the capital of Washington, at 7 o'clock this evening, and took carriages from the car to the state house, where a joint session of the legislature was to be held at 7:30. The house of representatives was crowded with members of both houses, and the lobbies by spectators. Lieutenant Governor Daniels presided, and beside him sat the speaker of the house and Governor Rogers. We occupied an hour in presenting the exposition enterprise and the applause was frequent. Those who spoke were Wattles, Webster, Chase and Hitchcock. After the meeting closed we went to the hotel and got supper. We had not had <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> to get it before. Our meal was made jolly by the receipt of a telegram announcing that the Chicago &amp; Northwestern had subscribed $30,000 to the stock of the exposition.</p>
<p>At noon tomorrow we go to Portland, but we do not as yet know whether we continue to California or home. We may even take in Oregon. We have now met seven state legislatures in joint session, which is, I think without precedent.</p>

<head type="sub">DELAYS THE BIG APPROPRIATION BILLS</head>
<head type="sub">Other Pressing Business Held Back While the Senators Criticize the President&#8212;May Force Speaker Reed's Hand.</head>
<p>WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The sundry civil bill, which carries an appropriation of $275,000 for the Transmississippi and International Exposition, reported yesterday from the senate committee on appropriations, will be one of the last bills to be taken up by the senate. It is intended that the Indian appropriation bill shall be followed by the postal bill, that in turn by the District of Columbia bill, then the sundry civil bill and finally the general deficiency bill. There is, however, widespread doubt that the sundry civil bill will get to the president in time for his signature, if he decides to sign it, and what is more likely, run the gauntlet of his veto, for it carries a great many items which the president has repeatedly stated should not become laws so long as he was in the executive chair.</p>
<p>There is a story prevalent now that the senate did not care very much whether any of the appropriation bills got through at the session in order to force Speaker Reed to appoint his full list of committees for the extra session of congress, instead of but the three committees, as he had outlined to his friends. Should the sundry civil bill fail to become law, interesting questions would arise as to whether the government could complete its exposition building at Omaha in time for the opening of the Transmississippi Exposition. The day frittered away upon the discussion of Cuban affairs means a rush of business at the very close, which may entail the failure of many bills to become law. The house has gotten rid of all its appropriation bills, but the senate committee is still at work on the general deficiency, other bills mentioned having been reported out of the committee.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">TALK OF NORTHWESTERN SUBSCRIPTION</head>
<head type="sub">Local Representatives of the Opinion that Other Chicago Lines Will Lead Assistance to the Exposition.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The Northwestern's subscription of $30,000 to the Transmississippi Exposition and The Bee's announcement of the fact yesterday afternoon were the principal subjects of discussion in local railway circles this morning. General Agent Kuhn of the Northwestern knew nothing of the matter until he returned from a trip through the state last evening. He was much pleased with the news and said that he knew that the subject had been under serious consideration and that when the company did announce a subscription it would be a liberal one. He and the other representatives of the Northwestern continued to receive congratulations throughout the morning.</p>
<p>The local offices of the roads that have as yet not subscribed promptly telegraphed the news to their respective headquarters. Two of the four Omaha-Chicago lines have now announced liberal subscriptions to the exposition and the local representatives of the other two will endeavor to induce their superiors to hurry up with their subscriptions in order not to be lost in the shuffle. The annual meeting of the Rock Island will occur at an early date and favorable action is looked for at that time. All the local railroaders agreed that the Northwestern's subscription was a liberal one, but not more liberal than was expected from that company after the location of the exposition on its line.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">ALMOST HALF A MILLION.</head>
<p>The subscription of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway company of $30,000 to the Transmississippi Exposition capital stock, which was announced yesterday by President Hughitt, pushes the total subscription list up to $438,480, almost to the half-million point, and the remaining trunk lines are fully expected to raise the total to a point above the mark.</p>

<pb n="117" xml:id="TMISB02-117"/>



<p>The committee which went to Chicago about a month ago to interview the officials of the railroads centering in Omaha agreed in advance upon the amounts which the several roads ought to subscribe, the proportion being based on what was believed to be the relative advantage to be gained from the exposition by each road. This apportionment placed the amount to be asked of the Northwestern at exactly the figures represented by the subscription made by that road yesterday, viz.: $30,000. The amounts to be asked of the other roads were as follows: Rock Island, $25,000; Union Pacific, $25,000; Missouri Pacific, $20,000; Milwaukee, $20,000.</p>
<p>These roads were each asked to subscribe the amounts named and lengthy interviews were had with the representatives of each road by the committee, after which the matter was taken under advisement. The Northwestern is the first road to respond. If the other roads are not heard from within a few days the same committee will again visit Chicago to see if matters cannot be hastened and it is fully expected that the remaining roads will at once follow the pace set by the Northwestern and subscribe the full amounts asked of them. This will make the total amount subscribed $528,480.</p>
<p>The notice of the subscription of the Northwestern system came in the shape of a telegram from President Marvin Hughitt in Chicago, addressed to Chairman Lindsay of the Department of Ways and Means and was as follows:</p>
<p>Chicago &amp; Northwestern system of roads will subscribe $30,000 to the full paid capital stock of the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898. Payment on account thereof to be made as assessments are called by the proper authority of the corporation. This subscription is made on the express understanding and with the right reserved to the company to make this sum a donation and not to accept the stock of the association.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">PARK BOARD TALKS EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">It Plans for Boulevard Improvement in North Omaha.</head>
<p>The Board of Park Commissioners had a long and very voluble meeting yesterday afternoon, at which a number of improvements which relate more or less directly to the exposition were discussed at length. There were two large delegations from the North Side, each with a scheme. The first was from North Omaha and it presented a petition to the board to accept North Twenty-second street from Cuming to Locust streets and Locust street from Twenty-second to Twentieth as a boulevard. It was urged that the people wanted another outlet to the exposition. The subject was referred to the committee on designation of grounds to report at the next meeting.</p>
<p>A delegation from the North Side Improvement club requested the board to do something to put the Nineteenth street boulevard into better condition. They also wanted a bicycle path at least on that part of the boulevard between Ames avenue and Miller park. The request was referred to the committee of the whole, but in the course of the discussion it was practically agreed that the improvements asked for should be made.</p>
<p>The question of the employment of a superintendent of parks was referred to the committee on employment and supplies, with instructions that no superintendent should be engaged before April 1, and that his compensation should not exceed $100 a month for the time actually employed.</p>
<p>The ordinance passed by the city council last month turning over South Eleventh street to the board of boulevard purposes was taken up and referred. The plan proposed by the council is to have a boulevard extending from the viaduct south on Eleventh street to Bancroft, and thence cast on Bancroft street to Seventh, to connect with the boulevard which now leads to Riverview park.</p>
<p>It was informally agreed by the board that the Florence boulevard will be maintained as a dirt road during the coming season. It is proposed to keep the driveway in condition by grading, sprinkling and rolling, and without resort to the more expensive experiment of macadam or cinders.</p>
<p>Plans were also ordered prepared to show the width of sidewalks along Nineteenth street boulevard and also the location of grass plats, space for trees, etc.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Legislature Will Appropriate Half and Marcus Daly Gives the Rest.</head>
<p>HELENA, Mont., Feb. 27.&#8212;(Special telegram.)&#8212;The committee on appropriations of the house will this morning ask unanimous consent to introduce a bill providing for the appropriation of $15,000 for the purpose of having an exhibit of Montana's resources at the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha. The state constitution provides that no appropriation bill can originate in either house within ten days of the end of the session without unanimous consent of all the members. So it is seen that one refractory member can hold the appropriation up if he chooses to. The announcement will be accompanied by a statement by Chairman Cochran of the appropriation committee that he talked over the telephone with Marcus Daly, the Anaconda copper king, at Butte, and that Mr. Daly assured him that he would give a like amount to that appropriated by the legislature. Mr. Daly says he will turn the money over to the commission to be appointed to expend the money of the state and will let the commission do as it sees fit.</p>
<p>It is not believed that there will be any objection to the introduction of the bill, although there will be some votes against it, and the friends of the exposition movement here believe that the bill will pass. The governor will be favorable to it if it does.</p>
<p>The money will be divided into two appropriations&#8212;$5,000 for 1897 and $10,000 for 1898. In addition to the $30,000 now looked forward to the citizens of the state will be asked to subscribe a private fund. The mine owners will have an exhibit of their own.</p></div2>

<p>The $30,000 subscription of the Northwestern railroad system to the stock of the exposition has encouraged the department of ways and means to hope that subscriptions from the remaining roads solicited will be soon forthcoming.</p>
<p>While it had been hoped that the Burlington and the Northwestern would subscribe $50,000 each, it is considered that they have set a very respectable pace for the other roads. The Union Pacific and the Missouri Pacific have been asked for $25,000 each and the Milwaukee and the Rock Island for $20,000 each. A committee conferred with the officials of all the roads several weeks ago and another trip will be made to Chicago in a few days. It would be made immediately but for the fact that a trip by a delegation to visit the South Dakota legislature has been planned. The party will start Sunday night.</p>
<p>Manager Lindsey of the ways and means department says that one of the most important results of the subscription of the Northwestern will be to make more vivid the general idea of the magnitude and significance of the enterprise, so that the interest in it of the members of the legislature of the western states will be increased to such an extent as to warrant the expectation of good appropriations.</p>
<p>The total subscriptions now amount to $438,000, and if the other railroads come up to expectation they will raise it to over  $500,000.</p>
<p>The doubt as to whether the delegation on the Pacific coast would go on to Sacramento and San Francisco has been settled. It will go. As has been already intimated, the ladies of the party will come back to Salt Lake City and wait there while the incursion into California is made.</p>
<p>The Cadahy Packing company has come into line with the announcement that it will take enough space to show the largest packing house display that has ever been made in the world. Negotiations and preparation accordingly are in progress.</p>

<p>The women of the Second congressional district, including Douglas, Washington and Sarpy counties, will meet in mass meeting at the Creighton theater in Omaha at 2 o'clock Thursday, March 4, for the purpose of electing two women from this district, outside of Omaha and South Omaha, as members of the Board of Lady Managers of the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
<p>Arrangements have not been perfected for the meeting. President Wattles and Chairman Lindsey of the executive committee are both out of the city and Secretary Wakefield says he has received no instructions in the matter. Unless other arrangements are made the meeting will be called to order by Secretary Wakefield and the women present will be asked to elect a chairman and secretary and take full charge of the meeting. But little interest seems to be manifested in the matter by the women of Omaha. The plan of organization provides that the members from this congressional district must reside outside of Omaha or South Omaha, so that the women of these two cities are prohibited from being candidates. They are not debarred from taking part in the meeting, however, but there are indications that the attendance of Omaha women will be small. There seems to be a few candidates and no public announcements have been made.</p>
<p>The women of the Fourth congressional district will meet in Crete Thursday of this week to elect two members of the board. The place of this meeting has not yet been fixed, as Secretary Wakefield has not received any reply to his letter to the mayor of Crete asking him to procure a place for the meeting.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON, March 1.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;At 2 o'clock yesterday the senate agreed to appropriate $275,000 for the Transmississippi and International Exposition, to be held in Omaha in 1898, thereby raising the amount in the original bill as reported to the house $75,000. In addition to this amount the sundry civil bill carries $125,000 for the completion of the federal building at Omaha; $75,000 for the South Omaha post office; $175,000 for the topographic survey in various portions of the United States, $35,000 of which shall be expended west of the Ninety-seventh meridian, in the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Texas and the Territory of Oklahoma, and at least one-third of the remainder to be expended west of the One Hundred and Third meridian; $25,000 is made immediately available, upon suggestion of Senator Thurston to repair and protect the works in the neighborhood of Nebraska City on the Missouri river.</p>
<p>The sundry civil bill was considered in its entirety before the senate adjourned this morning, and all items upon which agreement was had were passed. At the convening of the session this afternoon the bill was completed and placed upon its passage.</p>
<p>The sugar bounty clause, which was inserted by the senate, was passed by that body without engendering any debate. It carries upward of $1,000,000, and will be insisted upon by the senate conferees. Members of the appropriation committee in the house state that they will favor the retention of the amount if the senate insists upon keeping the amount in the bill.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">PUBLICATION IS CHEERFULLY DONATED</head>
<head type="sub">Department of Buildings and Grounds is Considering Plans for Laying Out the Exposition Site.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The old adage, "a <choice><sic>phophet</sic><corr>prophet</corr></choice> is not without honor save in his own country," is well exemplified in the case of the Transmississippi Exposition. While the members of the Nebraska legislature are haggling over making an appropriation in aid of the exposition and are making sarcastic allusions to the great fair as "an Omaha scheme," the people and the newspapers of the east are discussing the exposition as one of the most important events which has been proposed in the history of the greatest nation on earth. The eastern newspapers are full of this discussion, and the magnitude of the great show which is to exhibit to the world the gigantic resources of the largest part of the United States is fully appreciated. Column after column is printed in the great dailies of the east and many of them are devoting full pages to the subject, copiously illustrated with pictures of Omaha subjects.</p>
<p>The matter for these articles is furnished by the press bureau of the exposition, but the fact that these great papers will devote conclusive proof of the importance attached to the subject by the management of these papers.</p>
<p>The value of the advertising for the whole state obtained by means of this wide publicity is incalculable and is a faint indication of the benefit the state will derive from the exposition itself. The matter appearing in these papers is not advertising in the sense of being "paid matter," but is descriptive writing of inestimable value as a means of keeping the resources of the great transmississippi region, and especially Nebraska, before the eyes of the reading public of the east.</p></div3>
<div3>
    <head type="sub">PREPARING THE PLANS.</head>
<p>While little has apparently been done by the management of the exposition in the way of active work on the grounds or buildings which are to shelter the great show, the arrangement of the preliminary details has been going on rapidly. A vast amount of preliminary work is necessary before the active work of building can be commenced and this work has been occupying the attention of Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, and of Dion Geraldine, superintendent of construction. The executive committee decided about two weeks ago that the main buildings should be nine in number and the arrangement of these buildings in such a way as to make a harmonious whole is <unclear reason="torn"></unclear></p>
<p>The next step will be the employment of a supervising architect to decide upon the general design of each building in order that there may be no discordant effect in the ensemble. Then will come the employment of other architects to design the buildings in detail. While this latter work is being done the work upon the grounds will go forward and this will necessitate the employment of landscape gardeners to lay out the grounds and beautify them. All of this work will be commenced in the early springtime in order that the landscape features may have the advantage of a full season's growth before the exposition is held. A small army will be required to accomplish the immense amount of work which will be necessary and the direction of this work and the workmen will require executive ability of a high order.</p></div3>
<div3>
    <head type="sub">FOUR PERMANENT BUILDINGS.</head>
<p>The material to be used in the construction of the buildings has not been decided upon by the exposition authorities, but it is more than likely that the temporary buildings will be built in the same way as the World's fair buildings, of staff, a form of stucco. The plan of the exposition authorities, however, contemplates one or more permanent buildings built in a permanent and substantial manner, if the necessary arrangements for so doing can be made, but it is certain that some of the buildings will be of a permanent character. The government building will probably be one of these, the purpose of the exposition promoters being to purchase this building after the exposition is over. It is also the purpose to have the auditorium constructed of permanent material. While no positive action has been taken regarding the plan of this auditorium, the idea of following the design of the famous Mormon temple in Salt Lake City has been discussed informally by the executive committee and has met with great favor. It is well known that the Mormon temple has the most perfect acoustic properties of any public building in the United States, if not in the world, and the suggestion that the exposition auditorium be constructed on the same plan has proved to be a most popular one.</p>
<p>According to the plans as at present outlined, the buildings for the exposition will cost fully $1,000,000, and it will be seen that the appropriation of the Nebraska legislature will form scarcely a drop in the bucket in the general plan, whether that appropriation be $100,000 or $200,000.</p></div3></div2>

<head type="sub">PLAN SUGGESTED BY THE LOCAL SOCIETY</head>
<head type="sub">Proposition is to Give the Public a Correct Idea of the Mode of Life in the "Fatherland."</head>
<p>The German-Americans of this city are intending to cut a pretty wide swath in the Transmississippi Exposition. If their plans, which are still in a somewhat embryotic state, reach anywhere near the fruition which it is hoped they will, the Germans will have one of the features of the show.</p>
<p>The start was made last Sunday afternoon in Germania hall, where a joint meeting was held for the ostensible purpose of bringing about a union of the different German societies of the city. After the transaction of some routine business the meeting simmered down into an exposition gathering, and there the plans were hatched. That the members are in earnest was evidenced by the appointment of the following committee on ways and means and arrangements: Phillip Andres, Dr. Peter Schwenk, Jacob Houck, George Heimrod and Robert O. Fink.</p>
<p>As so far considered the plans propose that the German Americans shall be give a considerable space on the exposition grounds. Upon this is to be erected one main building or auditorium, which will be used principally for meeting purposes. About this are to be clustered a number of smaller buildings. The present idea is to have these conform to the architecture of Germany&#8212;structures one or two stories in height, with thatched roofs. In these and smaller buildings it is intended to reproduce some of the life of the "Fatherland." The little manufactories in the Black Forest, whose products are known all over the world, will be represented. These will show the old-fashioned processes used in making the wooden clocks and other woodenware, the grinding of grain, the making of meerschaum pipes and the many other manufactures that will interest the general American public. The articles so made will be offered for sale. One of the smaller buildings would be transformed into a tavern conducted on the German plan. It is pro-<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> give a day to some one or other of <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> different German societies, upon which a turnfest or a saengerbund or some other such festivity might be held. It is thought that if some such scheme as this is started it would not be difficult to get some of the large, and that even the national gatherings of German societies might be obtained.</p>
<p>By setting aside some such German day every two weeks or so it is believed that a goodly portion of the transmississippi German population at least could be induced to attend the big show. It is estimated that in the states adjourning Nebraska&#8212;Iowa, South Dakota, Missouri, Kansas&#8212;there are in the neighborhood of 500,000 German-Americans. It is thought that 200,000 of these might be attracted to the city.</p>
<p>The committee in charge has not yet mapped out a plan by which the necessary finances can be raised, but Dr. Schwenk, one of the committee, has bee pushing a scheme. He proposes to form a company, duly incorporated under the laws of the state, which shall have a board of directors to have the matter in charge. The stock in the company will be $1 a share, payable in quarterly assessments. Some such plan will undoubtedly be adopted by the committee in the near future.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Members of Ceramic Club Preparing Their Plans.</head>
<p>The regular monthly meeting of the Nebraska Ceramic club was held in the Young Men's Christian association building this forenoon. The club has already commenced planning for an elaborate exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition. This has so far been confined to a general discussion of individual ideas, but a definite line of preparation will be taken up at an early date. Just at present the members are most interested in the annual exhibit of the club, which will be given April 10. It is expected that this will be one of the most successful exhibitions yet given. One of the features will be a sale of hand-painted teacups. Each woman visitor will be served with a cup of tea in a handsomely painted cup, which she will be allowed to retain at a nominal price.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Northern Committee Unable to Get Beyond Salem, S. D.</head>
<p>SALEM, S. D., March 1.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The northern committee of the Transmississippi Exposition spent last night very pleasantly in Sioux City and were met by the president of the Commercial club, W. A. Irwin, and other prominent business men. This morning they wished the committee a successful trip. At Hawarden, Ia., they were met by Mayor Meyer and a delegation of citizens, who were profuse in their well wishes for the great exposition. At Alton, Ia., another delegation, headed by Mayor Van Dyke, Editor Pratt of the Republican and Mr. Moody, regretted that they had not received an earlier notice of the committee's coming in order to have given them a rousing welcome. On account of another snow storm and a high wind the train could go no further than this place, but the crew hopes to get through the drifts tomorrow. If that is impossible the train will start for home in the afternoon. The Knights of Pythias are to have a grand entertainment here tonight, which will, judging by the numerous arrivals in sleighs and sleds, bring together several hundred people. Judge Clarkson is invited to make a short talk on the one absorbing topic&#8212;exposition. The people up this way have heard of and are commending the Northwestern system for the public-spirited manner in which it subscribed $30,000 for the exposition. All are very proud of the Northwestern system.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Exposition Delegation Doing Good in California.</head>
<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
<p>Sacramento, Cal., March 2.&#8212;Completing over 4,000 miles the exposition delegation arrived at San Francisco Monday noon and registered at the Palace hotel. The reception by the state board of trade was held at their rooms. The delegation called on Mr. De Young, who gave many pointers on the successful conduct of expositions, and assured the committee of his cordial aid to the Trans-Mississippi exposition.</p>
<p>The delegation arrived here this evening, except Captain Palmer, who addresses the annual banquet of the state commander of the Loyal Legion at San Francisco tonight and joins the delegation tomorrow. We leave Sacramento tomorrow night and arrive in Omaha Saturday. </p>
<p>By appointment we appeared before the senate tonight. A joint session was out of the question on account of the press of business. Hitchcock in an able manner gave the story and progress of the exposition to date, and spoke briefly of the great benefits California received from the splendid exhibit at the World's fair and from the Mid-Winter exposition at San Francisco.</p>
<p>In each speech made since leaving Omaha some new and interesting argument has been made, and tonight in a brief manner the great advantage of our exposition was brought out in a manner most interesting to the senators, as shown by frequent applause.</p>
<p>Poppleton closed in a brief speech which was well received and the good effect of the meeting was apparent.</p>
<p>At noon tomorrow we present arguments to the house and at 2 o'clock we meet Governor Budd by appointment. A bill has been favorably reported by the committees in both houses carrying a $50,000 appropriation and has passed a second reading in the house. There seems to be no opposition to the measure in the legislature and our only danger is a veto by the governor.</p>
<p>Secretary Filcher of the state board of trade came here from San Francisco with our party, and will stay several days to help Vice President Parsons.</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchcock is now at a banquet of editors and correspondents of California, and will respond to a toast on the exposition, and enlist the press of the state in our favor if possible.</p>
<ab>WATTLES.</ab></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<ab>(Tacoma (Wash.) News.)</ab>
<p>The legislature is asked to appropriate $10,000 to provide for the representation of Washington at the Trans-Mississippi exposition to be held at Omaha next year. The sum is small for such a purpose and yet it will suffice if carefully handled. The purpose is good and the benefit to be derived by the state should be considerable.</p>
<p>In the boom period the state lavished a very large sum on a display at the Chicago fair. no such reckless expenditure as to amounts and method of disbursement is ever likely to be made again. In future more care and attention must be given to the representation of the state at expositions, and very much better results may be obtained at a very much smaller outlay.</p>
<p>The Omaha exposition will primarily and chiefly illustrate the great development of the new west. It will, however, be national in its scope and will be international to some extent in its character.</p>
<p>The exposition's effect should be to stimulate immigration, give an impetus to investment, encourage development, make more widely known the great resources of the western country and increase the market area for western productions.</p>
<p>The legislature can well afford to make the modest appropriation asked for this advantageous enterprise.</p></div2>

<p>Bismarck, N. D., March 2.&#8212;Senate bill No. 162, providing for the representation of North Dakota at the Trans-Mississippi exposition, passed the senate today by a vote of twenty-two to five. It will probably pass the house tomorrow.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">EXPO IN SOUTH DAKOTA.</head>
<head type="sub">Friendly Action Is Counted Upon&#8212;Delegation in Snow Drifts.</head>
<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
<p>Pierre, S. D., March 4.&#8212;The northern committee of the Trans-Mississippi exposition, after a few days' delay at Salem, was able to proceed on the way to Pierre, S. D. Huge snow drifts were encountered on the way, but Pierre was finally reached, thirty-two hours later than the regular time. Two of Salem's prominent citizens, Mr. Patton, editor of the Republican, and Mr. Todd, banker, accompanied the committee to Pierre, and have offered assistance in bringing the Omaha gentlemen into friendly relations with the senators and representatives and citizens of Pierre.</p>
<p>Last night a joint special session of both houses was held in the capital building. Governor Lee presiding, assisted by Lieutenant Governor Handmann and Speaker of the House Colvin. The attendance was very large, not only legislators, but citizens, also, apparently taking great interest in the subject of the exposition. An hour was accorded Messrs. Lindsey, Scott and Clarkson, for the purpose of explaining and advocating the exposition and urging an appropriation for an exhibit and representation for South Dakota. The remarks were very favorably received, and were followed by short addresses by Governor Lee and Lieutenant Governor Handmann, both favorably to an appropriation.</p>
<p>Action was taken afterward in both houses, which indicates an early passage of a bill for an appropriation in the sum of $15,000 or upward. The committee expected to start for home at 3 o'clock this morning, but a blizzard, east of Pierre, had indefinitely postponed the leaving of all trains.</p>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">ON THE HOME STRETCH.</head>
<head type="sub">South Dakota Legislature Winding Up its Business.</head>
<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
<p>Pierre, S. D., March 4.&#8212;Today both branches of the legislature devoted a large share of their time to consideration of appropriation bills. Each branch has passed its bill on almost the same form as introduced by the committees. That of the house was considerably in excess of the senate, and this difference has been increased by the action of the senate in striking out of its bill $10,000 for the new Springfield normal school. A conference committee will have to adjust the difference between the two houses, and the governor will then have a chance to use his pruning knife upon it.</p>
<p>The usual press of people who have measures hung up is to be seen, but most of these will probably be doomed to disappointment, for a bill which has failed to get through before this hour has about one chance in a thousand of passing.</p>
<p>The senate today passed its bill prohibiting the use of passes on the part of state officers and members of the legislature. The senators who voted for it will probably arrange with the house sifting committee so that the bill never sees the light of day there. They also passed the bill admitting the graduates of the school of osteopathy to practice in South Dakota.</p>
<p>The house passed the bill changing the election of judges from off years to years in which general elections take place. There is some doubt of the constitutionality of the law.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">THE EXPOSITION BILLS.</head>
<ab>(Los Angeles Herald.)</ab>
<p>Two of the four exposition bills to which reference was made a short time ago in these columns, are now out of the account. The Guatemala bill was passed and the exhibit is now almost ready for shipment. The Nashville appropriation, after passing the two houses, was vetoed by the governor. Two more measures remain, the Trans-Mississippi exposition bill for $50,000, and the Paris exposition for $20,000.</p>
<p>The Guatemala exposition, as was pointed out by the Herald some time ago, can be of very little service to Southern California, for the reason that we have no  possible trade connection with that country. At some future date, when a coast line of steamers comes into existence, the case may be different, but at present San Francisco is the only section of the state that can hope to benefit in this display. Immigration is not to be expected from that country.</p>
<p>The downfall of the Nashville appropriation through the governor's veto caused great regret among the progressive spirits at this end of the state, who were anxious to see California products shown where much good could be accomplished both for trade and immigration.</p>
<p>Four years ago the state appropriated $300,000 for the great exposition at Chicago, and the immediate result was a wave of immigration that added 30 per cent to the population of Los Angeles in three years. If, as is sometimes claimed in the north, Los Angeles gets all the advantage of such new immigration, it behooves the northern section to wake up and do its part in the advertising that brings new people to the state. Unfortunately the governor did not look at this matter with the eyes that we in the southern counties see it, and hence the veto.</p>
<p>The Trans-Mississippi measure, which has been pigeonholed until a few days ago, was worked out of committee chiefly through the exertions of Mr. George W. Parsons, the vice president of the Omaha fair executive committee for the state of California, and is now pending with a good chance for passage. The Herald is hopeful that the bill, if passed by the legislature, will receive the governor's sanction and become a law. The Omaha exposition will be one of the largest ever held in the country, and most of the western states will be well represented by displays of products. California should be included in the list of those who participate. We have goods to sell and are located out of the line, and therefore must advertise to do business. The governor is a good business man and must appreciate that fact.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">EXPOSITION ATTRACTIONS.</head>
<head type="sub">Yacht Racing by Electricity on Lagoon&#8212;New Exhibitors Apply.</head>
<p>E. G. Solomon of this city has perfected a contrivance for reproducing on a somewhat reduced scale and on the lagoons of the Trans-Mississippi exposition grounds the famous yacht race between the Defender and the Valkyrie. The control of the yachts is to be by a cable concealed under water. The yachts will be large enough to accommodate about fifty persons each. Solomon expects to apply for the privilege of putting this attraction on the grounds. The power will be electricity.</p>
<p>Recent applications for space are from the J. W. Sefton Manufacturing company, Chicago; Reliable Incubator and Brooder company, Quincy, and the Fort Wayne Electrical Co-Operative company.</p>
<p>General Manager Dickinson of the Union Pacific has assured the exhibits department that the Abe Lincoln car will beheld here to be placed on exhibition.</p>
<p>Word is expected every day from the promoting delegation that went down into Mexico. It has been in the southern republic about a week, and as soon as its gets into the United States again it is presumed that it will telegraph the result of its conference with the Mexican government officials.</p>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">HOUSE PROCEEDINGS.</head>
<head type="sub">Exposition Appropriation Bill Passes&#8212;Goes to the Senate</head>
    <div3>
<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
<p>Lincoln, Neb., March 4.&#8212;When the house was called to order this morning it was announced that Representative Lucien Stebbins had been summoned home to the bedside of his wife, who is dangerously ill. Stebbins was excused from attendance.</p>
<p>House roll No. 435, to authorize the commissioner of public lands and buildings to select and accept for the state of Nebraska certain tracts of lands in the Fort Randall military reservation as indemnity school land, was read the third time and passed.</p>
<p>House roll No. 259, providing for extending the provisions of the farmers' mutual insurance law so as to permit farmers' mutual insurance companies to insure country churches and school houses and country parsonages, was read the third time and passed.</p>
<p>The Trans-Mississippi exposition appropriation bill was passed by a vote of 70 to 20.</p>
<p>Pollard (rep.), who was absent from the room during roll call, afterwards asked for unanimous consent to have his vote recorded for the bill. Soderman and Wooster objected, and Pollard is recorded as not voting.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">MOTION NOT PRESENTED.</head>
<p>A motion to have the bill recommitted to the committee on engrossed and enrolled bills have instructions to have the emergency clause attached, was not presented, as had been looked for, it being evident that this would not have been successfully accomplished.</p>
<p>The bill will now go at once to the senate and go through the regular course in the passage of that body.</p>
<p>When the bill, which is house roll 93, was read the third time in its regular order Wooster of Merrick asked if it was proper to put the bill upon its passage until the committee appointed to inquire in the charges of inaccuracy of the engrossed and enrolled copy had reported. Felker did not believe that even if there was a showing that the word "association" in the designation of the exposition organization had been left out it would not affect the bill.</p>
<p>Gaylord wanted to know if the tabling of the resolution to submit to the supreme court the other day did not table the bill.</p>
<p>The speaker informed him that it did not.</p>
<p>Jenkins wanted to ask if the speaker ruled that a bill would be put upon its passage while the question of its accurate engrossment was undecided?</p></div3>
   <div3>     
<head type="sub">BACKED BY THE COMMITTEE.</head>
<p>The speaker thought that as the investigation committee had been given an opportunity to report and had not done so, and as the committee on <choice><sic>egrossed</sic><corr>engrossed</corr></choice> and enrolled bills had reported the bill accurately engrossed, there do not appear to be any sufficient cause for waiting for the investigation committee.</p>
<p>Severe told that his whole committee on engrossed and enrolled bills had examined the error, corrected it and reported the bill properly engrossed.</p>
<p>Wooster and Fouke got into a controversy as to what the investigating committee had done. Both being members of that committee, a point of order was sustained that discussion was out of order in reading.</p>
<p>Eager of Seward moved that the bill be recommitted to the committee of the whole for specific correction, said correction to be the striking out of the word "association" in section five. This is the alteration charged by Wooster to have been made by interlineation.</p>
<p>Clark of Lancaster made the point of order that as the engrossed copy and the printed bill corresponded exactly, there was no correction to be made. The speaker held that the point was well taken.</p>
<p>The bill was put up on its passage and the roll call shows 70 voting for and 20 against.</p>
<p>The bill was amended so as to conform to the Gaffin amendment as passed, and the bill was then declared passed.</p>
<p>The bill goes now to the senate.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">VOTES EXPLAINED.</head>
<p>There were a number of explanations of votes as the calling of the roll progressed. These explanations, which were read, were as follows:</p>
<p>I vote for this bill because it is in the line of progress and because progress is consistent with my part creed.</p>
<p>I vote for this measure on the same principle that I will vote for a bounty on sugar beets, to encourage, to develop, to emphasize and advertise the agricultural resources of this agricultural state.</p>
<p>I am ashamed of my state for the delay which the majority in power here has caused to this bill. It ought to have been passed weeks ago.</p>
<p>I have not been wrestled with, prayed with and lobbied with by the governor, by his private secretary, by the oil inspector or by any of the clique which bosses the majority of this house. Neither has my vote on this measure been promised in advance by my political leaders.</p>
<p>I have never been banqueted by the exposition managers and my party in the minority here has not been cuddled, cajoled, coaxed, flattered or coerced in the interests of the bill.</p>
<p>I have never sounded the dreary fog horn of pretended reform and false economy, neither have I made pretended assaults at the salaries of other employes of the state.</p>
<p>I vote for this bill, not on the principle of "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth," as has been expressed here on the other side of the house, but on that higher principle of progressive, disinterested, non-partisan legislation in the interests of the state and of all the people.</p>
<p>I therefore vote "Yes."</p>
<ab>F. B. ALDERMAN, Sixteenth District.</ab></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">LOOMIS' ARGUMENT.</head>
<p>By Loomis of Butler:</p>
<p>Believing that an appropriation to the Trans-Mississippi exposition to be incompatible with the financial condition of the state, and also of the individual citizen, and believing that it would tend to centralization and to be against the best interests of the state, I vote no.</p>
<p>By Wooster of Merrick:</p>
<p>This bill, in my opinion, is unconstitutional and a monstrous robbing of the people, I vote no.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">JENKINS PROTESTS.</head>
<p>By Jenkins of Jefferson:</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker: I desire to enter my protest against any bill being placed on its final passage when serious charges of irregularities are pending and a committee of investigation on fraudulent charges in the bill have not yet reported to the house. I vote no.</p>
<p>By Webb of Custer:</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker: On behalf on a bankrupt treasury and a tax-burdened people, I protest against voting a single cent of the state's money to the Trans-Mississippi exposition or any other show on earth. I believe the best way to "stand up for Nebraska" is to stand up for the interests of taxpayers, who are asked to bear the burdens of this exposition, without receiving a just proportion of the benefits. I vote no.</p>
<p>By Grosvenor of Hamilton:</p>
<p>Believing that the bill should be so corrected as to leave no doubt as to its provisions, I am compelled to vote no.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">TITLE AS AMENDED.</head>
<p>The title as amended, on motion of Smith and Douglas, read as follows:</p>
<p>A bill for an act to provide for the participation by the state of Nebraska in the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition to be held in the city of Omaha, state of Nebraska, in the year 1898, for the appointment of a state board of directors by the governor, and to authorize the governor to fill any vacancy occurring among the said six state directors; to provide for a notification by the governor; to provide for the fixing of said compensation of each member of said board, and for the limitation of time for which they shall be paid; to provide for a state exhibit at said exposition; to define the duties of the board of directors in relation thereto, for the payment of salary to each director, and for the appropriation of $100,000; to provide that said state board of directors shall have control of the expenditure of said appropriation shall be expended; to provide for the presentation, auditing, approval and payment of claims arising from the expenditures of said board, to fix the place where said board of directors shall conduct its business; to provide for a record of its acts, doings and expenditures; to provide for the sale of the property after the close of the exposition.</p></div3>

<p>Owing to the absence from the city of several members, the directory of the Omaha Fair and Speed association was a couple of hours late in getting a quorum yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>W. G.

In other words, $15,000 of the $30,000 bonds which the association is <choice><sic>authoried</sic><corr>authorized</corr></choice> to issue have been subscribed for, over $4,000 having been put down in the last week. He was hopeful that the entire issue would be taken up in a short time, and the association thereby placed on a good business footing.</p>
<p>Letters received by D. T. Mount, who has charge of the June race meeting, regarding special attractions were submitted and discussed. One which met the informal approval of the directory is a pacing horse, record 2:06 1/4, which has been trained to pace without driver, sulky or even bridle. A bicycle is used to set the pace, and it required a speedy man to come in first.</p>
<p>John A Wakefield, who has been secretary of the association since its organization two years ago, tendered his resignation, and it was accepted. Some member of the directory will be assigned the task of keeping the record of the meetings, as the position since the heavy work of organization, etc., was completed, has not paid any salary.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Party Coming From the East to Awaken Local Interest.</head>
<head type="sub">President Wattles and Manager Hitchcock Will Visit Sacramento.</head>
<head type="sub">Vice-President George W. Parsons Furnishes Some Facts Concerning the Exposition.</head>
<p>George W. Parsons, vice-president for California of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition at Omaha, to take place next year from June to November, has received a dispatch from E. C. Hunt, superintendent of promotion, informing him that Manager Hitchcock, President Wattles and other prominent Omaha citizens will visit Sacramento. Their purpose is to confer with legislators in reference to the appropriation to have California represented. The dispatch is in full as follows:</p>
<ab>OMAHA, Nebr., February 18, 1897.</ab>
<p>Hon. George W. Parsons: Committee of prominent Omaha citizens, headed by President Wattles and Manager Hitchcock, accompanied by their wives, will arrive at Sacramento next week on a special car to present exposition matter. Arrange for joint session of Legislature if possible and it not have a meeting of a joint committee of both houses. Have papers announce coming. Have the Governor cooperate. Legislature and cities thus far visited have accorded handsome reception and every courtesy. It gives the project a decided impetus. Will wire time of arrival as soon as possible.</p>
<ab>E. C. HUNT, <lb/> Superintendent Department of Promotion.</ab>
<p>Mrs. Parsons said last evening that he considered that it will be of much importance to California to be represented. He also explained at length the facts concerning the Omaha exposition.</p>
<p>"It is the outgrowth," said Mr. Parsons, "Of the trans-Mississippi congress. The exposition will represent directly all the States and Territories west of the Mississippi River. The remainder of the country will be invited to take part, but the exposition will be distinctively Western.</p>
<p>"The sense of the eighth trans-Mississippi congress was that such an exposition would be of great advantage to the West. In fact, the vote was unanimously in favor of it. The trans-Mississippi congress is a very representative body, embracing many eminent men.</p>
<p>"The claims of the country west of the Mississippi to have a distinctive exposition are well based. Two-thirds of the area of the United States lies west of the Mississippi, and that area contains one-third of the population and one-half of the wealth of the entire country.</p>
<p>"The Eastern States had their chance for exploitation at Philadelphia in 1876. The central part of the United States was advertised at Chicago. The South had the Atlanta Exposition and also the Cotton-growers' Exhibition at New Orleans. The West has never had a distinct exhibition. Omaha, which was selected as the site, is the gateway to both the East and the West. Within a radius of 500 miles, taking Omaha as a center, a circle would touch fifteen States and Territories, in which reside 20,000,000 persons. If only 10 per cent of these should attend, the gathering would be very large.</p>
<p>"California certainly should be well represented. The United States Government has recognized the importance of the exposition. The sum of $200,000 has been appropriated and a bill is pending before Congress asking for $300,000 more. The bill appropriating $50,000 pending at Sacramento is out of the Assembly and on its third reading in the Senate."</p>
<p>The articles on incorporation define more fully the purposes to be the holding of an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the States and Territories of the United States of America west of the Mississippi River, and also such exhibits as may be provided by the United States or any State in the United States, or any foreign country, for the purpose particularly of exhibiting to the world the products, industries and capabilities generally of the said States and Territories west of the Mississippi River.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Make a Good Impression and Overcome Many of the Objections Offered by Governor Budd&#8212;Homeward Bound.</head>
<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
<p>Sacramento, Cal., March 3.&#8212;Our labors before the legislature and governor of California are closed and we leave by evening train for Omaha. After our hearing before the California senate last night we felt quite confident of action of that body at an early date. There remained, however, the house of representatives and the governor. We have today done the best we could to present the exposition matter in a favorable aspect before both.</p>
<p>In the house of representatives the hearing lasted nearly an hour. The speakers were Webster and myself. Our speeches were not as favorably received by the house today as by the senate last night, and we realize some vigorous opposition is likely to develop. Nevertheless Representative Valentine, who has charge of the bill, informs us this evening that the effect of our presentation of the case has been favorable. A few days ago he felt serious misgivings as to the fate of the exposition bill, but he now expresses the opinion that it will pass the house, if it can be passed through the senate first. Senator Bulla hopes to get it through the senate within a few days, and may even be able to do so late this evening.</p>
<p>Concerning Governor Budd's attitude on the bill much anxiety has been felt. He last week vetoed the appropriation for the Nashville exposition, and he is strongly committed to a rigid policy of economy. We therefore, waited upon him in full force to present the matter strongly. He gave us a hearing of half an hour, although very busy. I think we removed most of his doubts concerning the enterprise and materially improved the chances of a bill when it reaches him. He is a man of strong convictions and character, a great admirer of Bryan and a Jacksonian democrat, who believes in economy with a big E. We have done the best we could, at least we leave the local friends of the bill greatly encouraged. In fact, they express confidence that our visit will enable them to overcome all obstacles.</p>
<p>All San Francisco papers have given considerable space to the accounts of our visit and its purpose. The Call today publishes an able editorial in support of the bill. With newspaper help and with the aid of the chambers of commerce of Los Angeles and San Francisco, which have been enlisted, we think we shall win. I think we get home Saturday afternoon. We shall probably omit Nevada. Most of us find it necessary to get home. G. M. Hitchcock.</p></div2>

<div3><head type="main">FROM OMAHA.</head>
<head type="sub">Delegates of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition</head>
<head type="sub">Presented to President Diaz Yesterday. Pleasant and Satisfactory Interview.</head>
<p>Yesterday morning by the National, there arrived in this city seven very prominent citizens of the State of Nebraska, who bore a special commission to Mexico. They were delegates from the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition which will be held in Omaha from June to November next year. These gentlemen were Mr. C. S. Montgomery, director and counsel of the Exposition, and Chairman of the Committee; Hon. Euclid Martue, postmaster of Omaha, and Ex-National Commissioner of the Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893; Major E. H. Crowder, Judge. Advocate of the Department of the Platte, U.S. Army, Rev. Dr. S. Wright Butler, the leading Congregational clergyman of Omaha; Hon. E. J. Cornish, ex-city Treasurer and present member of Omaha Park Board; Mr. J. O. Phillips, Assistant General Passenger and Freight Agent of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company at Omaha; and Hon. A. J. Cornish, District Judge of Nebraska, residing at Lincoln. All of the above gentlemen, excepting the last-named are from Omaha.</p>
<p>After their arrival in this city yesterday morning, they paid their respects to the American Legation and the Consulate General, and arrangements were made by Judge Ignacio Sepulveda, the Charge d'Affaires, that they should be received by President Diaz yesterday afternoon immediately following his reception of the National Editorial Association. This was accordingly done. Judge Sepulveda presented them personally to the President whose dignified and commanding presence impressed them most favorably. Mr. Montgomery then delivered the following address which was only interpreted by Judge Sepulveda.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">THE ADDRESS.</head>
<p>Your Excellency:</p>
<p>We consider ourselves fortunate that we are permitted personally to present to the President of the great Republic of Mexico, the enterprise, which we are officially authorized to represent and which is known as the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition to be held at the City of Omaha in the State of Nebraska, United States of America, from June to November 1898. West of the Mississippi River in the United States lie twenty-four States and Territories covering an area of nearly 2,700,000 square miles and a population of over 20,000,000. These States and Territories are identical in certain interests, especially applicable to themselves, among which are irrigation of arid regions, the development of harbors on the Gulf of Mexico, and the construction of north and south lines of railway, directly connecting the lakes of the North with the Gulf on the South, the Northern and Southern states with each other and all with the Republic of Mexico; all to the end that the varying products of the great West may be more easily interchanged to the benefit of all, and the present friendly and growing trade relations between the Governments fostered.</p>
<p>To promote and advance these and other important interests a Trans-Mississippi Congress was organized several years ago, which is constituted by delegates appointed by the Governors of the several States and Territories. At the session of this Congress in November 1895, it was decided to hold a great Exposition at Omaha in 1898 for the purpose of exhibiting the products, industries, resources and civilization of the Trans-Mississippi country, and the United States Congress was requested to <choice><sic>authorizs</sic><corr>authorize</corr></choice> and promote the enterprise. <choice><sic>Pursuane</sic><corr>Pursuant</corr></choice> to this action the <choice><sic>Trans-Mississippt</sic><corr>Trans-Mississippi</corr></choice> and International Exposition was organized and there was expressly included in its purposes, that of exhibitions by foreign countries. The organization, thus perfected, was immediately presented to the United States Congress for approval, and several months ago an act was unanimously adopted in both houses and approved by the President, recognizing the Exposition and pledging the general Government to its support. At the present session of Congress a large appropriation has been granted, and it is expected that our general Government will expend $500,000 in aid of the enterprise, which will include a government building and an exhibit as large and as fine as has ever been furnished. Up to this time for Exposition purposes private citizens have subscribed over $500,000 which will be at least doubled, a municipal appropriation has been made, several States have pledged support and made preliminary appropriations, and acts are now pending in the Legislatures of all the other States and Territories, providing for representation and appropriations therefore.</p>
<p>The Exposition being thus supported in our country and its certain, great success assured, we are now looking to other countries, and particularly to other Republics, and above all the Republic of Mexico to help make the Exposition attractive by such exhibits as will reflect credit upon those who furnish them and result in such profit and benefit as necessarily follows, when the products, resources and civilization of a country are made to appear.</p>
<p>We regard the Republic of Mexico in her excellent condition of modern advancement, as especially interested. You can greatly aid our Exposition with an exhibit which cannot be excelled by any other country and perhaps hardly be equalled, and, at the same time, derive there from those benefits, which arise from a desirable immigration, an increased permanent population and the enlarged industrial development resulting from increased invested capital.</p>
<p>From what has been said you will observe that our Exposition is National in character and representative of an empire in territory and of a <choice><sic>grett</sic><corr>great</corr></choice> people.</p>
<p>The participation of your Republic with us is earnestly desired and will most surely result in strengthening the friendly relations which already exist to so large a degree between the two Republics.</p>
<p>We come to you as an authorized committee to present in person this invitation, which in due time will be furnished in official form.</p>
<p>Having performed this pleasurable duty we bet to thank you for our most courteous reception.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">REPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.</head>
<p>Gen. Diaz expressed the liveliest interest in the great industrial Exposition and at once realized the value to Mexico of the aims and objects of the Trans-Mississippi Congress. He said that is soon as the formal invitation was received with all the plans and full details of the Exposition, he would take up the matter and see to it that Mexico made an exhibit worthy of her great natural resources which were not sufficiently known abroad. In fact, the delegates could count upon his most hearty co-operation, as he well knew the importance of Mexico being properly represented such a mammoth affair as the Trans-Mississippi States are preparing for next year.</p>
<p>The remarks of the President were pithy and emphatic and the delegates retired fully satisfied that Mexico's exhibit at the Exposition will be by no means one of the least of its attractions.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">THE TRANS-MISSISSIPPI EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>The value to any country of expositions, or great fairs, hardly can be over estimated. They bring together large bodies of people from all sections of the country; they render possible an intermingling and interchange of thought; they cause each to see and know what progress the other is making. They are wondrous educators.</p>
<p>The great exposition of 1897 will be that held in Nashville, Tennessee, of which frequent mention has been made in THE TWO REPUBLICS; the great exposition of 1898 will be The Trans-Mississippi Exposition, to be held in the City of Omaha, Nebraska. A committee composed of some of the most prominent residents of Omaha now are in the city in the interests of that Exposition. As elsewhere stated, they were yesterday given an audience by President Diaz, who, in response to their address and invitation, assured them that the matter would receive the early consideration of the Government, and that they might expect its co-operation.</p>
<p>The importance of this to Mexico is very great. What this country greatly needs is a better understanding of its resources and opportunities on the part of the people of the United States. Much may be accomplished in that direction by a full and complete exhibit at the Omaha Exposition. It speaks much, too, for the interest and importance which attaches to Mexico that so considerable a number of prominent men should deem it advisable to make a special trip to this city in order to secure the assistance of this Republic in their work. Mexico no longer is a back number; she is sought, rather than seeking.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">EVIDENCES OF PROSPERITY.</head>
<p>The men and women who compose the editorial excursion now on a visit to this city are presumed to be men and women of rather more than the average observing powers of individuals. That is a portion of their training. It will doubtless strike them forcibly that Mexico is quite a different land than what is often pictured to them by sensational newspaper correspondents, who write for so much per column and without the slightest measure of conscience. The editors have traveled several hundred miles in Mexico territory and have not been foot-padded nor maltreated in any way. It must be a surprise to find that this is really a civilized country, and that most of the residents eat three meals each day just the same as Americans and wear clothes in place of the skins of wild beasts. We trust that some of these observations will be recorded when the editors get home, to the end that their neighbors may be enlightened and their minds disabused of some of the fables concerning Mexico. The real facts are that Mexico stands today along with the other nations of the world in point of advancement. The revolutionary period is past. The days of bandits and highway murders are the robbing of bullion trains are to be found only in yellow-backed books or occasionally in the columns of a newspaper whose editor has been imposed upon. It is a fact that human life and property are more secure today in any portion of this Republic than they are in many of the great cities of the United States. Mexico is a wide-awake, progressive nation, with a man at the helm who is every inch a statesman. He has made Mexico what she is and he will keep her where she belongs.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><dateline>THE REPUBLIC: ST. LOUIS, MO., FEBRUARY 22, 1897.</dateline>
    <head type="sub">OMAHA'S EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>The visit to St. Louis of the committee of Omaha citizens in behalf of the Transmississippi and Interstate Exposition is a timely reminder of the importance of taking energetic steps to secure adequate representation at the exposition for St. Louis and Missouri.</p>
<p>It was at the Omaha meeting of the Transmississippi Commercial Congress that the idea of holding a great exposition of the products, industries and civilization of the States west of the Mississippi River was started. A resolution <choice><sic>indorsing</sic><corr>endorsing</corr></choice> the project was presented by William J. Bryan, who was presiding over the Congress, and was adopted with enthusiastic unanimity. Omaha was selected as the location of the exposition.</p>
<p>Great credit is due the citizens of Omaha for the liberal and enterprising spirit which has marked their efforts to meet the heavy labor and responsibility placed upon them in preparing for the fair event. From the day of its inception the scope of the enterprise has steadily grown. Beginning with $300,000, the stock subscriptions have grown to $600,000 and the Board of Directors of the Exposition has determined to raise $1,000,000, the full limit of the amount authorized by the charter. The success of Omaha's part in the project is assured.</p>
<p>There are excellent prospects that the States interested in the Exposition will do their full share towards realizing its purpose. Appropriations for exhibits are expected in all of the transmississippi States. Congress has appropriated $200,000 for a Government exhibit and a bill is pending for $300,000 more. Foreign nations have been invited to participate.</p>
<p>St. Louis is the metropolis and Missouri is the empire State of the region to be represented at the Exposition. In this vast region, no city equals St. Louis in wealth and importance and no State equals Missouri in richness and variety of resources. More than any other transmississippi city and State they exhibit the wonderful development of the region and are more conspicuously than others the immediate heirs of the future. Their part in the Exposition should be that of leadership and pre-eminence in display.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that the Missouri General Assembly will deal liberally in making provision for the State's display and that citizens of both St. Louis and the rest of the State will go vigorously to work to secure representation that will be worthy of the commanding importance of the commonwealth in the trans-mississippi country.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">PREPARING FOR A TRANS-MISSISSIPPI EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">Representatives Visit San Antonio But Will Not Meet the Citizens Here Until They Return From a Trip to Mexico.</head>
<p>A distinguished party of gentlemen came in on a special car attached to the south-bound International train last evening. The following was the personnel of the party:</p>
<p>C. S. Montgomery, chairman, accompanied by Hon. Euclid Martin, Hon. A. J. Cornish, Rev. S. W. Butler, E. J. Cornish, Esq., Mr. J. O. Phillipe and Major E. H. Crowder. They constitute a committee traveling in a special car to promote the interests of the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha from June to November, 1898.</p>
<p>They wired Mayor Callaghan yesterday asking that preparations be made so they could meet a representative body of citizens last <choice><sic>ngiht</sic><corr>night</corr></choice> to lay before them the object of their visit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Mayor was absent in Austin yesterday, but he and the Hon. J. L. Slayden joined them in their car en route from Austin, which gave an opportunity to talk over with them matters in connection with their visit.</p>
<p>They left this morning for the City of Mexico to confer with President Diaz in regard to a Mexican exhibit at the proposed exposition and will stop over here again en route home.</p>
<p>The Chicago Inter Ocean has the following to say editorially in regard to this project:</p>
<p>One of the most encouraging features of the hard times is the money and energy that the people of the Mississippi Valley are putting into great industrial expositions in celebration of their great progress and for the display of their vast resources. The State of Tennessee, at Nashville, on the 1st of May next, expects to open her centennial exposition, that is intended to excel any State effort of the kind that has preceded it. Omaha, the commercial metropolis of Nebraska, backed by that State and others to the West, announces a trans-Mississippi exposition for 1898 that, in extent and character, would be great in the boom times of a growing country.</p>
<p>These evidences of the people's returning confidence in the future should be welcomed and encouraged everywhere by everybody. The country never before had in it such an abundance of those things that go to make prosperity. The harvests have been luxuriant, there are new developments in our mineral resources and the energy and nerve force of the people after a rest of four years, awakening with guns that announce a new national administration, with American tendencies, are ready to show the world again what a free people can do. With the favor of such an administration the Mississippi Valley and the great States west and north not only can feed the world, but can supply it with the precious metals for all the uses of commerce and trade.</p>
<p>At the head of the trans-Mississippi Exposition are men of energy and character. They have laid a broad foundation for their exposition, which they intend shall be, like our great World's Fair, an eye-opener for Eastern cynics and critics. The Congress of the United States has already agreed to expend not less than $200,000 in an exhibition of the resources of the nation. The citizens of Omaha and the railroads and corporations connected with that city are expected to subscribe not less than $1,000,000. The State of Nebraska contemplates an appropriation of $350,000, and divers other States in the trans-Mississippi region give indications of entering cordially into the spirit of the originators of the great undertaking. Its entire success seems almost assured.</p></div2>

<p>Applications for space continue to multiply at the headquarters of the Department of Exhibits of the Transmississippi Exposition and the wide publicity given the exposition is bearing fruit at a rapid rate. Applications come from all portions of the country and from all kinds of industries, and the scope of the exhibits promises to be exceedingly broad. Chief Hardt of this department has had wide experience in exposition work and he expresses complete satisfaction with the manner in which applications are coming in.</p>
<p>Among the applications which have been received since the last <unclear reason="torn">port</unclear> of exhibitors are the following: <unclear reason="torn">land</unclear> Twist Drill company, Barrett &amp; <unclear reason="torn">B</unclear> Cider Manufacturing company, machines; Godfrey Wilton, New York, blinds and shutters; Paradigm Construction company, New York, skylights; Consolidated Acetylene Machine company; Caroline C.

<p>The Omaha meeting will be held in the Creighton theater at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. The meeting will be called to order by Secretary Wakefield and will then be turned over to the women. If the arrangements for the meeting have been made in advance, as was the case at the mass meeting of Omaha women, that plan has been very carefully concealed and the indications seem to be that those attending the meeting will be allowed to have something to say as to what shall be done and how it shall be accomplished. Secretary Wakefield very positively disclaims any knowledge of a prearranged plan and has no notice of any candidates being in the field.</p></div2>

    <div3>
<p>WASHINGTON, March 3.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Late last night the question of appropriating $75,000 additional for the Trans-mississippi Exposition came up in the consideration of the sundry civil bill, and the house refused to concur in the senate amendment, by a vote of 49 yeas to 92 nays. Representative Mercer presented reasons why this additional appropriation should be made, citing that the Treasury department had suggested that the additional sum should be appropriated in view of the larger cost in making the exhibit on account of the distance, and that the original bill had failed to provide for the return of the exhibit. In addition to outlining what was expected of the government, he said:</p>
<p>"Now, this amendment, No. 48, said, 'including the return of said government exhibit.' Of course, in Omaha we have a disposition to take everything which belongs to us, but we do not care to keep this exhibit any longer than it will serve the purposes of the exposition and the Treasury department has informed me and the exposition managers have informed me, that $50,000 of the amount originally provided is entirely inadequate to construct a building for the fish commission and also to construct the administration buildings. I do not think the members of this house desire to see a peanut show or to see a peanut building there, and I think they are great enough and magnanimous enough to give the appropriation that is provided in these amendments, providing for the return of the government exhibit to the city of Washington and wherever else it comes from.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">CHANCE FOR THE EAST.</head>
<p>"Mr. Speaker, that will be an exposition of no mean proportions. It will represent the resources, industries and capabilities of twenty-four states and territories, and I desire that for once the people of the United States may look over the Allegheny mountains and may travel there and take notice of the resources of that grand transmississippi country. We expect the east to come there with its capital and with its knowledge, and we expect that after that exposition has been seen by the people of the United States, those grand states and territories beyond the Mississippi will have an opportunity to grow and prosper the same as eastern states have done. I trust that members of this house, irrespective of politics, will help us on these three amendments."</p>
<p>Mr. Cannon, chairman of the appropriations committee, fought the senate amendments at every turn, taking the ground that the bill only called for $200,000. Although Cannon was arrayed on the side of no increase, it is thought that Mercer would have carried his point had not Hepburn of Iowa asked the question as to what Nebraska had done for the exposition. Mercer was compelled to state that nothing definite had been enacted by the state legislature. The vote being taken the senate amendment was not agreed to.</p>
<p>This, however, did not settle the matter, for the senate conferees have for ten hours stood for $275,000. Senators Thurston and Allen are working hand in hand to secure this amount. Two conferences have been had and a third will be ordered if necessary.</p></div3>

<head type="sub">Members of Board of Lady Managers of Exposition Elected.</head>
<p>Mrs. Angeline Whitney of Elk City, Douglas county, and Miss Helen Chase of Papillion, Sarpy county, were elected as members of the Board of Lady Managers of the exposition at the meeting of women of the Second congressional district held at the Creighton theater this afternoon. There were twenty-six women present, ten of them being from Papillion, two from Benson, two from South Omaha, and the balance from Omaha.</p>
<p>The meeting was called to order by Secretary Wakefield, who explained the object of the meeting, and Mrs. R. S. Towne was elected chairman, after Mrs. Witney, Mrs. Wakefield and Mrs. Towne had been nominated and each had declined. Mrs. Towne was prevailed on to serve and she withdrew her declination and was unanimously chosen.</p>
<p>Mrs. Saulsbury of Papillion was chosen secretary.</p>
<p>The chairman asked that names of candidates be sent to the platform, and the following names were placed in nomination in that manner: Mrs. A. W. Clark of Papillion, Miss Helen Chase of Papillion, Mrs. Omar Whitney of Elk City.</p>
<p>Chairman Towne ruled that but one ballot would be necessary, in view of the small number present, and Dr. Eleanor Daily, Mrs. Anglin, both of Omaha, and Mrs. Mead of South Omaha were appointed tellers. When the ballots were counted the vote stood as follows: Mrs. Clark, 12; Miss Chase, 14, and Mrs. Whitney, 26. Mrs. Whitney and Miss Chase were thereupon declared elected and the meeting at once adjourned.</p>
<p>Mrs. Whitney has been identified with state and county fairs for a number of years and has had more or less experience in work of that nature. She is the wife of Omar Whitney, a well known farmer in the northwestern part of Douglas county. Miss Chase is a dressmaker in Papillion and informed a Bee representative that she had never had any experience in exposition or fair work.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">NEBRASKA HOUSE VOTES FAVORABLY</head>
<head type="sub">Amended Measure Carrying $100,000 Goes Through This Morning by a Vote of Seventy to Twenty.</head>
<p>LINCOLN, March 4.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The exposition bill, house roll No. 93, as amended, appropriating $100,000 to the Transmississippi Exposition, was passed this morning in the house by a vote of 70 to 20. An attempt to delay the passage of the bill was made by Wooster, by insisting that changes had been made in the measure unauthorized by the committee on enrolled and engrossed bills. This accusation was vigorously denied by Severe, chairman of that committee.</p>
<p>Kapp's concurrent resolution, authorizing the commissioner of public lands and building to select lands on the Fort Randall reservation was passed, also Welch's bill, house roll, No. 259, authorizing mutual fire, lightning and tornado insurance companies. Rouse's habitual criminal act was lost.</p>
<p>The senate had a wordy session this forenoon, a lively debate being precipitated over an effort to order the Lincoln charter engrossed for third reading without considering it in committee of the whole. The attempt failed, as did also one to make it a special order for March 9. The balance of the morning session was taken up with routine work.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">SOUTH DAKOTA IS COMING IN.</head>
<head type="sub">Exposition Promoters Interest Both People and Legislature.</head>
<p>PIERRE, S. D., March 4.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The northern committee of the Transmississippi Exposition, after a delay at Salem, were able to proceed on the way to Pierre, S. D. Huge snowdrifts were encountered on the way, but Pierre was finally reached, thirty-two hours later than the regular time. Two of Salem's prominent citizens, Mr. Patton, editor of the Republican, and Mr. Todd, banker, accompanied the committee to Pierre and have been of much assistance in bringing the Omaha men into friendly relations with the senators and representatives and citizens of Pierre. Last night a joint special session of both houses was held in the capitol building, Governor Lee presiding, assisted by Lieutenant Governor Hindmann and Speaker of the House Colvin. The attendance was very large, not only legislators but citizens apparently taking great interest in the subject of the exposition.</p>
<p>An hour was accorded Messrs. Lindsey, Scott and Clarkson for the purpose of explaining and advocating the exposition, and urging an appropriation for an exhibit and representation for South Dakota. The remarks made were very favorably received and were followed by short addresses by Governor Lee and Lieutenant Hindmann, both favorable to an appropriation. Action as taken afterward in both houses which indicates an early passage of a bill for an appropriation in the sum of $15,000 or upward.</p>
<p>The committee expected to start for home at 3 o'clock this morning, but a blizzard east of Pierre indefinitely postponed the leaving of trains.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">FATE OF THE EXPOSITION BILL.</head>
<head type="sub">Measure to Come Up Before the Next Congress.</head>
<p>The news that President Cleveland had failed to sign the sundry civil bill and that the exposition appropriation had shared the fate of all other appropriations for the governmental departments was received in Omaha with expressions of disappointment, but this feeling was short-lived in view of the fact than extra session of congress is assured and that the necessity for making appropriations for the several departments named in the defunct bill will unquestionably result in a new bill being introduced immediately after the next congress convenes. The failure if the bill to become a law will, consequently, delay the appropriation but a short time and there is a general sentiment that an increased appropriation may be secured, instead of the $200,000 carried by the bill thus allowed to expire without receiving the sanction of the executive.</p>
<p>The friends of the exposition heaved a sigh of relief at the news that the lower house of the Nebraska legislature had at last passed the bill appropriating $100,000 for the exposition. It is anticipated that the senate may increase the amount of the appropriation to $150,000, and it is fondly hoped that the house may be induced to concur in this change, but the failure to incorporate the emergency clause in the bill before it passed the house is regarded as an unfortunate feature. Unless the emergency clause is attached the bill will not take effect until ninety days after the legislature adjourns, which would delay all action under the provisions of the bill until about the first of July, or later. This would leave less than a year in which to make all preparations for a state exhibit and building. By those posted in such matters the time is regarded as being too short.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">SENT THROUGH BY SEVENTY</head>
<head type="sub">PASSAGE OF THE EXPOSITION MEASURE</head>
<head type="sub">Wooster, Jenkins, Gaylord and Eager Try to Stop the Bill, but Are Thwarted at Every Point.</head>
    <div3>
<p>LINCOLN, March 5.&#8212;The Transmississippi Exposition bill passed the house yesterday without the emergency clause, but a vote 70 to 20. As amended the measure provides for an appropriation of $100,000, instead of $200,000, as was incorporated in Gaffin's amendment to the original bill appropriating $350,000. Before the vote was taken Wooster said the charges had been made that the bill had been tampered with, and that a committee had been named to investigate these charges. He wanted time, as one of the committee, to make such a report. Speaker Gaffin replied that ample time had been given the committee, and that the bill had now come up in its regular order and could be acted on.</p>
<p>Jenkins of Jefferson said he would protest against such a ruling and wanted his protest to go on record. Severe, chairman of the committee on engrossed and enrolled bills, said that so far as his committee was concerned, the bill had been correctly engrossed. He said that Wooster had been before the committee a few minutes, and had then gone away after making a few comparisons.</p>
<p>Wooster made a violent speech, in which he alluded to "whitewashing" by the committee to inquire into the condition of the bill, of which he was chairman. He wanted more time to examine the bill, and said that changes had been made by the chief clerk. He wanted to summon witnesses, and put them on their oath.</p>
<p>Fouke, another of the committee, repelled the insinuations of Wooster. The point of order was raised that all this talk was out of order, and the speaker held the point well taken. Eager of Seward moved to recommit the bill for specific correction, but was ruled out of order as he had not specified what correction he desired to make. Eager then said he had reference to the word "association" which had been interlined subsequent to its having been erased from the original bill.</p>
<p>Eager then moved to recommit the bill and named the specific correction he wanted made. Clark of Lancaster made the point of order that the chairman of the committee on engrossed and enrolled bills had made the report that the bill was correctly engrossed, and that nothing else was upon the house.</p></div3>

<p>After the vote was announced Pollard of Cass came into the house and wanted to have his vote recorded for the bill. He explained that he had been called away to the telephone, but had left word with the chief clerk to record his vote that way. Speaker Gaffin said this could only be done by unanimous consent. If there were no objections Pollard's vote could be recorded as desired. This would have left the result 71 to 20. Soderman objected and Pollard said he would be satisfied to have his explanation recorded in the journal, which will be done.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">EXPLAINING THEIR VOTES.</head>
<p>The following explanation of his affirmative vote was made by Alderman:</p>
<p>I vote for this bill because it is in the line of progress, and because progress is consistent with my party creed.</p>
<p>I vote for this measure on the same principle that I will vote for a bounty on sugar beets, to encourage, to develop, to emphasize and advertise the agricultural resources of this agricultural state.</p>
<p>I am ashamed of my state for the delay which the majority in power here has caused to this bill. It ought to have been passed weeks ago.</p>
<p>I vote for this bill, not on the principle of "an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth," as has been expressed here on the other side of the house, but on that higher principle of progressive, disinterested, nonpartisan legislation in the interests of the state and of all the people. I therefore vote "yes."</p>
<p>The following explanations of negative votes were read by the chief clerk:</p>
<p>Believing an appropriation to the Transmississippi Exposition to be incompatible with the financial condition of this state and also of the individual citizen, and believing that it would tend to centralization, and to be against the best interest of the state, I vote "no."&#8212;Loomis.</p>
<p>This bill in my opinion is unconstitutional and a monstrous robbing of the people; I vote "no."&#8212;Wooster of Merrick.</p>
<p>I desire to enter my protest against any bill being placed on its final passage when serious charges of irregularities are pending and a committee of investigation on fraudulent charges in the bill have not yet reported to the house. I vote "no."&#8212;Jenkins of Jefferson.</p>
<p>On behalf of a bankrupt treasury and a tax-burdened people. I protest against voting a single cent of the state's money to the Transmississippi Exposition or any other show on earth; I believe the best way to "stand up for Nebraska" is to stand up for the interests of the taxpayers, who are asked to bear the burdens of this exposition, without receiving a just proportion of the benefits. I vote "no."&#8212;Webb of Custer.</p>
<p>Believing that the bill should be so corrected as to leave no doubt as to its provision, I am compelled to vote "no."&#8212;Grossvenor of Hamilton.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">CHANGES ITS TITLE.</head>
<p>Smith of Douglas then moved that the title of the bill be changed to read as follows, which prevailed:</p>
<p>A bill for an act to provide for the participation by the state of Nebraska in the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held in the city of Omaha, state of Nebraska, in the year 1898; for the appointment of a state board of directors by the governor, and to authorize the governor to fill any vacancy occurring among the said six state directors; to provide for a notification by the governor; to provide for the fixing of said compensation of each member of said board, and for the limitation of time for which they shall be paid; to provide for a state exhibit at said exposition; to define the duties of the board of directors in relation thereto, for the payment of salary to each directors, and for the appropriation of $100,000; to provide that said state board of directors shall have control of the expenditure of said appropriation; to provide for the organization of the state board of directors; to provide for what purposes the said appropriation shall be expended; to provide for the presentation, auditing, approval and payment of claims arising from the expenditures of said board; to fix the place where said board of directors shall conduct their business; to provide for a record of their acts, doing and expenditures; to provide for the sale of the property after the close of the exposition.</p></div3></div2>

<head type="sub">North Side Improvement Club Passes Resolutions on the Subject.</head>
<p>The Northside Improvement club last night held a mass meeting in Erfling hall for the purpose of considering a report to the effect that an effort is to be made to relocate the exposition site. The meeting was attended by about fifty. It resulted in the passage of a resolution, introduced by Councilman Christie, protesting against a removal from Miller park to any other site in the northern or any other portion of the city. Exposition Directors Price and Payne were present and reported that no proposition had been presented to the directory looking to the removal. The passage of the resolution was by no means unanimous as the vote to table it until some future meeting was lost by the close vote of 14 to 16. The motion to table was made because some of the members thought that the passage of the resolution was premature, in view of the fact that the directory was not officially considering a removal of the site.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="main">CHANGE OF EXPOSITION SITE</head>
<head type="sub">OLD FAIR GROUNDS MAY BE SELECTED</head>
<head type="sub">Many of the Miller Park Advocates in Favor of a Location Nearer to the Business Center of the City.</head>
    <div3>
<p>Negotiations have been pending for some time looking toward a change in the location of the Transmississippi Exposition, a very strong sentiment having developed in favor of having the site located at a point nearer to the center of population of the city than Miller park.</p>
<p>When the question of a site was under discussion by the Board of Directors of the exposition there was a strong opposition to the proposal to locate the exposition so far from the center of the city as miller park and predictions were freely made by people entirely disinterested that the proposed site was too far away to insure a good attendance. After the matter had been settled, however, these people acquiesced in the choice of a site and the matter appeared to be dropped. Shortly afterward Dion Geraldine, superintendent of construction of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, arrived in the city to assume the duties of his position under Manager Kirkendall. Mr. Kirkendall drove the new superintendent out to the grounds the morning after his arrival and Mr. Geraldine expressed the greatest disappointment at the great distance from the city. As they drove along by the corn fields and vacant lots stretching away in the distance Mr. Geraldine reiterated his disappointment and was very positive in his prophesy that the exposition could never be made a success at such a great distance from the city. After looking over the ground thoroughly the two men started toward the city, Mr. Geraldine continuing his expressions of disapproval at the selection. Mr. Kirkendall drove around by the old fair grounds on Sherman avenue, near Ames avenue, and asked Mr. Geraldine expressed the opinion that this might be made a most attractive spot and an excellent exposition site.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">RESULT OF INVESTIGATIONS.</head>
<p>Investigations were at once commenced with a view to seeing if the vacant ground in the vicinity of the old fair grounds could be secured for exposition purposes. These negotiations were conducted very quietly and little opposition was encountered from the owners of vacant land adjoining the fair grounds.</p>
<p>As the matter stands at the present time, Herman Kountze has given the free use of the tract of forty acres lying between Sixteenth and Twenty-fourth streets, and has said he will donate to the city ground for one or more permanent buildings. John L. Redick has agreed to give the free use of the vacant land in Oak Chatham addition, adjoining the fair grounds on the west and extending from Twentieth to Twenty-fourth street; negotiations are pending between the promoters of the change and J. J. Brown for the use of a large tract of ground lying along the east side of Sherman avenue has been secured, making in all about 160 acres.</p>
<p>It is proposed to connect the fair grounds and "Kountze Reserve," as the forty acres belonging to Herman Kountze is called, by a broad boulevard through Kirkwood addition, the addition joining the fair grounds on the south and lying between the fair grounds and Kountze reserve. To do this it may be necessary to close one or two of the streets through this addition temporarily, but no particular opposition to this is anticipated.</p>
<p>Some of the warmest supporters of the Miller park site have fallen in with the new idea and it has found great favor wherever it has been mentioned. Practically all of the advocates of Hanscom park site have signified their approval of the new location and a large number of the directors who voted for Miller park have likewise expressed themselves as being in favor of the proposed change. The railroad interests are practically a unit in favor of making the change and the street railway people have supported the idea from the first, as they could reach the new location with scarcely any change in their present trackage.</p>
<p>The matter has not been brought before the Board of Directors, as that body has had no meeting since the one at which the site was selected, but a meeting of the board will be held one week from today and it is likely that this question will come up for consideration.</p></div3></div2>

<head type="sub">Given a Warm Welcome by President Diaz.</head>
<p>The first news which has been received from the exposition promoters who made a tour of the southern states and then started for Mexico was in the shape of a bundle of papers received this morning at exposition headquarters. These papers proved to be copies of the Two Republics, the principal paper published in the City of Mexico. Its issue of February 27 contained over a column of an account of the visit of the delegation of Transmississippi Exposition representatives and the reception of the party by President Diaz on February 26. The account included the full text of the speech made by C. S. Montgomery in presenting the exposition project, setting forth the origin, plan and scope of the exposition, and closing with an invitation to the republic of Mexico to join with the transmississippi states in making an exhibit at the exposition.</p>
<p>The account concludes as follows: "General Diaz expressed the liveliest interest in the great industrial exposition, and at once realize the value to Mexico of the aims and objects of the Transmississippi congress. He said that as soon as the formal invitation was received, with all the plans and full details of the exposition, he would take up the matter and see to it that Mexico made an exhibit worthy of her great natural resources which were not sufficiently known abroad. In fact, the delegates could count upon his most hearty co-operation, as he well knew the importance of Mexico being properly represented at such a mammoth affair as the transmississippi states are preparing for next year.</p>
<p>"The remarks of the president were pithy and emphatic and the delegates retired fully satisfied that Mexico's exhibit at the exposition will be by no means one of the least of its attractions."</p>
<p>The same paper also contains an editorial warmly supporting the Transmississippi Exposition project, and strongly recommending that Mexico take advantage of the opportunity thus offered to make an exhibit of its resources an advertise to the world the advantages possessed by the southern republic.</p>
<p>Nothing has been heard from the party as to when the members will return to Omaha. It is expected that they will stop at Guthrie on the return trip.</p></div2>

<p>HELENA, Mont., March 5.&#8212;Late last night the senate passed the house bill appropriating $15,000 to be used in preparing an exhibit to the Transmississippi Exposition.

<p>E. G. Solomon of this city is the inventor of a yacht racing device which he proposes to install at the exposition grounds as a source of amusement for the visitors. The device is designed to operate in the lakes or lagoons of the exposition grounds and comprises two yachts, each controlled by a cable concealed beneath the water. The machinery is so designed that the result of the race cannot be foretold by any one. The motive power is electricity.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Friends of the Exposition at Washington Not Discouraged.</head>
<p>WASHINGTON, March 4.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The failure of the sundry civil appropriation bill to receive the president's signature, thereby temporarily losing to the Transmississippi Exposition $200,000, has caused widespread regret among the legislators who have helped the measure in season and out. President Cleveland received the bill in good season, but pigeonholed it. The extra session will have to look after the measure, and much of the same old fight will have to be gone over. There is no fear but that the exposition will profit by the delay.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">MAY NOT USE MILLER PARK</head>
<head type="sub">Movement on Foot to Change the Site of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition.</head>
<head type="sub">Plan to Locate It on the Old Fair Grounds Meeting With Much Favor.</head>
<head type="sub">Advantages to Be Gained by Bringing the Big Show Nearer Town&#8212;-Offers of the Lands Adjoining Are Made.</head>
    <div3>
<p>For several weeks the question of bringing about a reconsideration of the action of the board of directors of the Trans-Mississippi exposition, by which Miller park was selected as the site for the big show, has been under consideration by certain members of the board.</p>
<p>The subject was first suggested by Dion Geraldine, the superintendent of construction, and this was the next day after his arrival in the city, a few weeks ago. He and Mr. Kirkendall, the manager of the building and grounds department, drove out to Miller park. Mr. Geraldine at once commented on the disadvantage that the long distance from the city to the grounds would be to the enterprise, and was emphatic in saying that the site should be closer to town. Coming back, a stop was made at the old fair grounds on Sherman avenue. Mr. Geraldine said that with the ground adjacent, which could probably be acquired without great difficulty, there would be plenty for the exposition and suggested that the change be made if possible. He estimated that the exposition buildings could be placed on this site at from $50,000 to $100,000 less than on the Miller park site, and that on account of its nearness to town the gate receipts would be from $100,000 to $200,000 more.</p>
<p>His view of the matter was thought to be very reasonable and from the first met with great favor with those directors who have voted for Hanscom park as against Miller park, and chiefly because the latter was so far out. Some of the directors then took the matter up to see on what terms the old fair ground and the land adjoining could be secured, and the negotiations are still in progress.</p>
<p>This statement is based on the remarks made by Mr. Kirkendall, who feels that he has been subjected to abuse entirely unwarranted. He says that he has been charged with being on the inside of a scheme and that he has gone back on all sorts of promises made in favor of Miller park. He insists that he and the others who are in favor of the change, are actuated only by the motive of doing the best possible thing for the success of the exposition.</p></div3>

<pb n="127" xml:id="TMISB02-127"/>

<div3>
<head type="sub">NORTH SIDE CLUB TACKLES IT.</head>
<p>The matter was not publicly discussed until Thursday, when it was the topic of the North Side Improvement association. Councilman Christie severely attacked both the wisdom and the motives of those who were seeking to bring about a change of location and accused Kirkendall in so many words of having told lies about it and of how he should vote on the question of site in the first place. He asserted that Kirkendall had promised to vote for Miller park, and had then gone and done his best for Hanscom park. Directors Payne and Price, who were at the meeting of the improvement association, thought that the condemnatory resolutions which had been introduced by Christie were untimely and out of place, because, whatever might be in the thoughts of any persons, no formal proposition to change the location had been made to the directory. Dr. Hayes, Mr. McEachron and others expressed themselves as in favor of making the changes if possible and repeated the reasons why it was desirable.</p>
<p>With regard to his whole attitude as to Miller park Mr. Kirkendall says that he never promised to vote for that site. When its promoters came to him he expressed his appreciation of the advantages of the site and described what should be done in regard to getting promises of ground, but did not commit himself to this or any other sites.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WHAT THE PLAN IS.</head>
<p>The old fair grounds plan contemplates for a site the old fair grounds, comprising almost forty acres; Oak Chatham addition, lying immediately to the west, extending to Twenty-fourth street and comprising forty acres, a strip of forty acres owned by Herman Kountze lying just north of Pinckney street and stretching from Sherman avenue to Twenty-fourth street east and west, and running north to within two blocks of the fair grounds, and what is known as the Smiley tract lying east of Sherman avenue along the bluffs and comprising forty acres, or about that, making the total area for exposition purposes almost 160 acres.</p>
<p>John I. Redick, the owner of Oak Chatham addition, has agreed to donate it for the use desired; the same way with Mr. Kountze, who besides says, that he will give to the city sufficient ground for a permanent building, and it is believed that the whole site can be secured without any cost to the exposition.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">SENTIMENT OF DIRECTORS.</head>
<p>Mr. Wharton is one of the directors who were most zealous for Miller parks, but when this idea was mentioned he took up with it right away and is now enthusiastic in favor of it.</p>
<p>"I have," said he, "talked with a good many directors about the proposition, and they are all in favor of it. I have not yet talked with a director who is opposed to it. The opposition that I have heard of comes mostly from those who have secure adoption on lands around Miller park. This site is closer to the city and a part of the scheme <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> secure, say ten acres, chiefly in the <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> and owned by Kountze, for a permanent park, on which will be the permanent building. It may be necessary to get by condemnation a little strip perhaps a block wide on the east side of Twentieth street, leading from the  Kountze tract to the fair ground. This will make a wide communication between those two parts of the exposition ground. There ought to be a little park of this kind right here, and what Kountze does not donate the city can acquire by condemnation. According to this arrangement the park fund levy of $50,000 can be made available to aid the exposition and the city derive permanent benefit therefrom."</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">ALL ROADS WOULD PREFER IT.</head>
<p>Perhaps to a man those directors who voted for Hanscom park are in favor of the change. Naturally the Street Railway company supports it, for it would be without expense in getting to the grounds, lines of street railway already running along the east and west sides of the site.</p>
<p>It is also pointed out that from the point of view of steam railway facilities, the site proposed is much preferable to Miller park. The Northwestern road threw its influence for Miller park, but now joins all the other roads in urging the change proposed.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">WORD FROM SOUTHERN PARTY.</head>
<head type="sub">Mexican Papers Say It Enlisted Diaz' Interest.</head>
<p>The first word from the exposition promoting delegation that went down into Mexico that had been heard for a week came yesterday in the form of a telegram from Postmaster Martin to his family, saying that the company would be home Sunday. Secretary Wakefield also got some papers from the City of Mexico containing an account of the interview of the delegation with President Diaz and other officials of the Mexican government.</p>
<p>The exposition managers have word from the legislature of Oklahoma that that body is anxious to see the delegation, and if word can be got to it in time it will be asked to go to Guthrie.</p>
<p>The delegation was received by the president of Mexico last Friday morning. The following extracts are taken from the account of the interview in the Two Republics:</p>
<p>Yesterday morning by the National there arrived in this city seven very prominent citizens of the state of Nebraska, who bore a special commission to Mexico. They were delegates from the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition, which will be held in Omaha from June to November next year. These gentlemen were Mr. C. S. Montgomery, director and counsel of the exposition, and chairman of the committee; Hon. Euclid Martin, postmaster of Omaha, and ex-national commissioner of the Columbian exposition at Chicago in 1898; Major E. H. Crowder, judge advocate of the department of the Platte, U. S. A.; Rev. Dr. S. Wright Buttler, the leading Congregational clergyman of Omaha; Hon. E. J. Cornish, ex-assistant city attorney, and present member of the Omaha park board; Mr. J. O. Phillippi, assistant general passenger and freight agent of the Missouri Pacific Railway company at Omaha, and Hon. A. J. Cornish, district judge of Nebraska, residing at Lincoln. All of the above gentlemen, excepting the last named, are from Omaha.</p>
<p>After the arrival in the city yesterday morning, they paid their respects to the American legation and the consulate general, and arrangements were made by Judge Ignacio Sepulveda, the charge d'affaires, that they should be received by President Diaz yesterday afternoon immediately following his reception of the National Editorial association. This was accordingly done. Judge Sepulveda presented them personally to the president, whose dignified and commanding presence impressed them most favorably. Mrs. Montgomery then delivered an address which was duly interpreted by Judge Sepulveda.</p>
<p>General Diaz expressed the liveliest interest in the great industrial exposition and at once realized the value to Mexico of the aims and objects of the Trans-Mississippi congress. He said that as soon as the formal invitation was received with all the plans and full details of the exposition, he would take up the matter and see to it that Mexico made an exhibit worthy of her great natural resources which were not sufficiently known abroad. In fact, the delegates could count upon his most hearty co-operation, as he well knew the importance of Mexico being properly represented at such a mammoth affair as the Trans-Mississippi states are preparing for next year.</p>
<p>The remarks of the president were pithy and emphatic and the delegates retired fully satisfied that Mexico's exhibit at the exposition will be by no means one of the least of its attractions.</p>
<p>The delegation that went to North Dakota is expected home today.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">WOMEN MANAGERS.</head>
<head type="sub">Talk of a President Outside of Omaha&#8212;All but Two Members Chosen.</head>
<p>When the women of the Fourth congressional district meet at Hastings Friday and choose two members of the board of lady managers of the exposition the board will be complete and ready for organization. Secretary Wakefield says he will call a meeting for organization probably week after next.</p>
<p>There has been no discussion yet with regard to the presidency, though the sentiment has been expressed that the president should be selected from outside of Omaha and South Omaha. For secretary, it is thought that the exigencies of the situation will require an Omaha woman, and there is quite perfect agreement that Mrs. Ford would be the right party.</p>
<p>The members of the board, lacking the two to be elected, are:</p>
<p>Omaha&#8212;Miss Anna Foos, Mrs. W. W. Keysor, Miss Kate McHugh, Miss Alice Hittie, Mrs. Orietta Chittenden, Mrs. W. P. Harford, Mrs. E. A. Cudahy, Mrs. J. H. McIntosh, Mrs. S. R. Towne, Mrs. T. L. Kimball, Mrs. Euclid Martin.</p>
<p>South Omaha&#8212;Mrs. E. B. Towl, Mrs. A. A. Monroe.</p>
<p>Council Bluffs&#8212;Mrs. Edith M. E. Reed, Mrs. Sarah C. Key.</p>
<p>First District&#8212;Mrs. A. J. Sawyer, Mrs. A. W. Field, Lincoln.</p>
<p>Second District&#8212;Mrs. Omar Whitney of Elk City, Miss Helen Chase of Papillion.</p>
<p>Third District&#8212;Mrs. D. C. Giffert of West Point, Mrs. Hollenbeck of Fremont.</p>
<p>Fourth District&#8212;Not elected.</p>
<p>Fifth District&#8212;Mrs. J. B. McDowell of Fairbury, Mrs. F. Johnson of Crete.</p>
<p>Sixth District&#8212;Mrs. C. L. Kerr of Ansley, Mrs. Hattie Hunter of Broken Bow.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">THE EXPOSITION BILL.</head>
<p>There were several errors in the printed roll call on the final passage of the exposition bill as it was given in yesterday's World-Herald. Severe, who was shown as voting for the passage of the bill, voted against it. Roddy, who was shown as voting for it, did not vote. Schram, who was shown as voting against it, was not present and did not vote. The total vote on the measure was 70 for and 20 against.</p>
<p>Of the 70 votes in the affirmative, 45 were fusionists, while 25 were republicans. Of the 20 votes in the negative, 19 were fusionists and 1 was republican. Mr. Jenkins of Jefferson was the only republican to go on record against the bill.</p>
<p>Without the aid of the republicans the bill could not have been passed, and in simple justice to all, the World-Herald presents this analysis of the vote.</p>
<p>A reader asks the World-Herald "whether or not the $200,000 appropriation for the exposition was completely knocked out or if it was only the bill for $75,000 additional that was killed." The $75,000 appropriation which, through Senator Allen's efforts, was tacked on in the senate was stricken off in the house. The $200,000 appropriation then went to President Cleveland in the sundry civil bill. Mr. Cleveland's failure to act on this bill "killed" the $200,000 item also. But the exposition appropriation will be made at the special session, together with all other items included in the sundry civil bill. The failure of Mr. Cleveland to act while extremely aggravating is not serious and only occasions a delay of a few weeks.</p></div2>

<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
<p>Pierre, S. D., March 5.&#8212;Owning to a burning desire of the members of the populistic legislature of South Dakota to make a record of great deeds and small expenditures, appropriation bills were slaughtered in bundles without regard to merit. In the carnage the appropriation asked for the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition went to sleep, with the promise from many members of both house that should an extra session be called, which is considered probable, the bill would be brought up and a fair sum set aside to properly exhibit the resources of South Dakota. The following resolution was unanimously adopted:</p>
<p>"Whereas, There is to be held in the city of Omaha, Nebraska, in the summer of 1898, an exposition to be known as the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition, being distinctively an exposition of the industries of the states and territories west of the Mississippi river, be it</p>
<p>"Resolved, By the senate of the state of South Dakota, the house of representatives concurring, that we express our deep interest in and approval of the ends and purposes of said exposition, and it is the sense of this legislature that by private subscription and otherwise the people of this state should do everything in their power to secure at such exposition a creditable exhibit of all the varied interests and resources of South Dakota, and we recommend a liberal patronage of the same by our people to go Marcus Daly $10,000 better."</p>
<p>Wealthy men of South Dakota assured me today that a subscription would be started at once to raise $25,000 for the purpose of getting the great show.</p>
<p>Look for the committee when the ice goes out or before if the snow ceases to fall and winds to blow. Hundreds are waiting to get out on the first train.</p>

<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
<p>Carbon, Wyo., March 5.&#8212;We have just received telegrams from Governor Smith of Montana stating that the legislature has appropriated $15,000 for a state exhibit at the exposition. This news is highly gratifying because when we reached Montana an appropriation seemed improbable. It is also gratifying because it probably means a still larger contribution from Marcus Daly and other public spirited citizens of Montana.  G. M. HITCHCOCK.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">THREE WEEKS OF HARD WORK</head>
<head type="sub">Exposition Delegation Returns From the Far West Very Well Satisfied.</head>
<head type="sub">Held Conferences With Governors and Legislatures in Eight States on the Trip.</head>
<head type="sub">Feels Confident of Several Big Appropriations and Points to That of Montana as One of Them.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The exposition delegation, which has been visiting western states, returned to Omaha yesterday afternoon over the Union Pacific.</p>
<p>The special car "Silver City" still bore the large banners emblazoned with the name, date and place of holding of the exposition, albeit the three weeks of travel had subdued the bright colors and begrimed the once white canvas.</p>
<p>The delegates in the party were: G. W. Wattles, John L. Webster, William S. Poppleton, Capital H. E. Palmer, Clement Chase and G. M. Hitchcock.</p>
<p>They were accompanied by their wives, who not only traveled with them, but accompanied them generally in the formal calls on state governors and on several occasions attended the public hearings before the legislature.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">VISITED NINE STATES.</head>
<p>All members of the party were well, although somewhat fatigued. The trip had lasted three weeks, during which time nine states had been visited and public hearings had been given the delegation before eight legislatures. Besides these public hearings at which members of the delegation made speeches for the exposition, ten committee meetings were held and five or six conferences were attended to discuss prospects and plans with friends of the exposition. In addition to this there were seven formal calls upon governors, some of whom had to be argued with and some of whom were already favorable. Over and above all this there was a great deal of personal work to be done with individual members of the legislature to interest them in the enterprise and to explain its details. Last, but not least, members of the delegation made it a point to meet newspaper men and interest them in the exposition.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WRONG IMPRESSION.</head>
<p>Members of the delegation were some what surprised to learn on their return that reports had been circulated in Omaha to the effect that the delegation had trouble in securing transportation in California "because they were accompanied by their wives."</p>
<p>"That is nonsense," said Mr. Wattles. "We did not ask individual transportation. We had our car, and asked the Southern Pacific company to haul it. This the company consented to do as soon as we succeeded in laying the facts concerning the enterprise before the proper officials."</p>
<p>"I desire to add," continued Mr. Wattles, "That the presence of the ladies in the party reconcile us to a three weeks' absence from home that was filled with hard work from beginning to end."</p>
<p>"Was the trip an expensive one?"</p>
<p>"Not to the exposition," replied Mr. Wattles. "The car was given by Pullman, the railroads hauled it free and the exposition simply has the expenses of six men for three weeks. The expenses of the ladies are, of course, paid by the husbands individually.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">TANGIBLE RESULTS.</head>
<p>"What are the results of the trip?"</p>
<p>"The most tangible result is $30,000 from Montana, all of which is due to and one-half of which will come directly from Mr. Marcus Daly. California will, in my opinion, probably pass a bill for $50,000, although the fight is close. Washington seems likely to act favorably. Utah will appropriate without a doubt, if our representative there is correct in his opinion. Idaho is dubious. Colorado is still struggling with the bill. I am not advised as to Kansas. In Wyoming the bill was lost in the last days of the session by a scratch."</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">TWO OBSTACLES.</head>
<p>"Did you encounter serious obstacles?"</p>
<p>"Yes, two. The worst was the fact that our own state had not acted and was still fighting over the appropriation. The second was the general low condition of state finances everywhere and the demand for economy."</p>
<p>"Do you consider that the trip paid?"</p>
<p>"Paid? Well I should think it did. Not a state would have acted if the delegation had not visited it. Moreover, even if no state had been induced to co-operate the amount of advertising given to the enterprise was worthy many times what the trip cost. The whole west is talking about the exposition now, and Nebraska is getting a great reputation for enterprise."</p>
<p>"How many states do you think will be represented?"</p>
<p>"All of them. In those where the legislature fails to act private subscription or city and county enterprise will unite to make a fair showing."</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><dateline>THE OMAHA DAILY BEE:<lb/> SUNDAY, MARCH 7, 1897.</dateline>
    <head type="sub">PARTY FROM THE WEST RETURNS.</head>
<head type="sub">President Wattles Satisfied with the Result of Their Efforts.</head>
<p>After a junket of over 6,000 miles and an absence of almost a month, the western contingent of the exposition promoters returned home last night. The special sleeper, which bore the black and yellow banners of the party, was attached to the eastbound Overland of the Union Pacific, and arrived in Omaha at 4:40.</p>
<p>The party consisted of G. W. Wattles, John L. Webster, G. M. Hitchcock, Captain H. E. Palmer, Clemont Chase and W. S. Poppleton, nearly all being accompanied by their wives and children. The last stop made by the party was at Sacramento and the homeward run of over 1,800 miles was made without incident.</p>
<p>President Wattles of the exposition expressed himself as being well satisfied with the trip, taking under consideration the disadvantages encountered in the way of hard times, the lethargy of the home legislature in acting upon the Nebraska appropriation and other obstacles. "I think we may congratulate ourselves," he said, "upon having advertised the exposition over a vast territory. People of the western states who had never heard of the project were made acquainted with it in the best possible manner. Nearly all the capitals we visited had the legislature in session and in the majority of places we addressed a joint gathering of both the houses. It is true that the western country is feeling the effects of hard times most severely, yet wherever we went we met with loyalty to the great west and were handsomely received. Interest upon every hand was manifested in the great show and we were assured by all those in power that pressure would be brought to bear toward making appropriations for the state exhibits. The prospect for the Californian appropriation of $50,000 is, I think, most excellent; also for the Utah sum of $20,000. At Olympia we found the legislative houses wrestling with the subject of internal economy, but have a fair assurance that the state will come forward with at least $12,000 to represent the industries of this truly magnificent empire. The private subscription of Marcus Daly of $15,000 was most encouraging and I think the legislature of Montana will surely appropriate $15,000 in addition, if not more. The appropriations of Kansas and Colorado are more doubtful, yet they will unquestionably fall into line, as the work toward perfecting the exposition progresses."</p>
<p>Captain Palmer, John L. Webster, Clement Chase and others of the party expressed themselves along the same lines and appeared well satisfied with the outcome of the trip.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">RETURNS FROM MEXICO.</head>
<head type="sub">Exposition Delegation Gets Back From the South Well Satisfied.</head>
<p>Carroll S. Montgomery, Euclid Martin, Rev. Dr. Butler, Judge A. J. Cornish, E. J. Cornish, Major Crowder and J. O. Phillippi, who constituted the delegation that went down into Missouri, Arkansas, Texas and Mexico to boom the exposition, got home yesterday noon. They came over the Wabash from St. Louis, because the washouts on the Missouri Pacific had thrown trains out of schedule on that line and they would not have gotten in until this morning if they had waited to come over that road.</p>
<p>As they piled off the train yesterday morning they were loaded down with baskets of lemons, crates of canes, and Dr. Butler was lugging along a huge cage for a mocking bird which was safely wrapped up in another package.</p>
<p>The party was gone seventeen days and was in Mexico four days. They say they were most warmly received everywhere, and think there is no doubt that there will be good exhibits from Mexico and the states which they visited.</p>
<p>A feature of the visit to the Mexican capital that was not contained in the extracts from the Mexican papers printed the other day, was the interview with Mr. Leal, minister de fomenta, or in English, of the interior. He was very much pleased with the exposition scheme and said that with a proper invitation to participate there could be no doubt that Mexico would have as good an exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi exposition as at any place since 1880.</p>
<p>United States Minister Crittenden at the City of Mexico did every thing in his power to further the mission of the delegation, and the secretary of the legation said that this delegation was received by the president with unusual promptness.</p>
<p>The party expected to stop at Austin on the way back and meet the Texas legislature, but either the governor of Texas did not receive Mr. Montgomery's telegram or Mr. Montgomery did not receive his, and no appointment was made. The party, therefore, came through Austin without stopping.</p>
<p>That the delegation was desired to go to Guthrie to see the Oklahoma legislature was not known until its arrival here, the messages from here having missed the company.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">GOOD RESULTS WILL COME</head>
<head type="sub">EXPOSITION PROMOTERS IN FROM SOUTH</head>
<head type="sub">Confidently Expect Liberal Appropriations from Most of the States Visited, and Especially from Old Mexico.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The band of exposition missionaries that has been touring through the southwestern states and Mexico for the past three weeks returned to Omaha yesterday shortly before noon. The party consisted of Messrs. Euclid Martin, C. S. Montgomery, J. O. Phillippi, E. J. Cornish, Rev. S. Wright Butler and Major Crowder of this city and Judge Cornish of Lincoln.</p>
<p>All the members of the party report a pleasant trip and are of opinion that much good was accomplished in behalf of the exposition. They were not accompanied by any relatives or friends, and Mr. Montgomery, who acted as chairman of the committee, insisted throughout on strict attention to the business for which the expedition was started.</p>
<p>The missionaries feel most encouraged over the success of their mission in Mexico, and predict that the building and display of that country will be one of the greatest features of the exposition. No doubt is felt about securing an appropriation from Arkansas, and $25,000 is the sum thought to be assured.</p>
<p>Is it also believed that Missouri will aid with a liberal subscription. Some doubt is felt about a donation from Texas on account of legal obstacles in that state, though it is believed that these may be overcome later.</p>
<p>Jefferson City, Missouri's capital, was first visited. Addresses were made before a joint session of the legislature, and some influence brought to bear on individual legislators. The next stopping point was at St. Louis, where the sympathy and co-operation of the Board of Trade were secured, the president suspending business in order to listen to the Omahans.</p>
<p>A very successful interview was had with the legislators of Arkansas at Little Rock. Mr. Montgomery presented the facts and figures essential to an understanding of the exposition, and Messrs. Cornish and Butler followed with short appeals.</p>
<p>Brief stops were made at Hot Springs and at San Antonio. At the latter place Congressman Sladen was seen and pledged to do what he could for the exposition with the Texas legislature. He said, however, that there were certain laws of the state that stood in the way of an appropriation. It was then agreed to pass the capital of Texas until the return trip. On the way back Mr. Montgomery telegraphed the governor for permission to address a joint session of the legislature, but received no reply.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">RECEPTION IN MEXICO.</head>
<p>In the City of Mexico the most favorable interview was had. It was with President Diaz, and had been well arranged by ex-Governor Crittenden, the American minister there. Mr. Montgomery presented the objects of the exposition to President Diaz, and after a short address left with him a Spanish translation of a letter giving complete information about the exposition. The reception by President Diaz was most courteous, and at its close he said that he was in full sympathy with the undertaking and would see to it that Mexico was creditably represented with a grand exhibit. He desired, however, that the matter be placed before him in an official way by the president of the United States. Mr. Montgomery assured him that an invitation from such a source should not be wanted. The secretary of state of Mexico was also called upon.

<pb n="129" xml:id="TMISB02-129"/>

He had charge of the Mexican display at the World's fair. he inquired particularly about space for exhibits and regulations, and agreed to do all in his power to make the Mexican exhibit a success.</p>
<p>The members of the party say that they are under obligations to these railroads for numerous courtesies extended: Missouri Pacific, Texas Pacific, International &amp; Great Northern, Mexican National, Wabash and Omaha &amp; St. Louis. It was due to the kindness of General Managers Ramsey of the Wabash and Barnard of the Omaha &amp; St. Louis that the party was enabled to reach home yesterday. A wreck on the Missouri Pacific delayed travel on that road and the Wabash at once agreed to bring the party to Omaha.</p>
<p>Five members of the party have been through Europe, but they declare that a Mexican tour is far ahead of any European trip. All were well laden with souvenirs and with newspaper containing interviews booming the exposition.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><dateline>THE OMAHA DAILY BEE:<lb/> TUESDAY, MARCH 9, 1897.</dateline>
    <head type="main">Exposition Endorsements</head>
<head type="sub">BY THE TRANSMISSISSIPPI PRESS.</head>
<p>Tacoma (Wash.) Ledger: No better opportunity has ever been presented than that of the great exposition to be held in Omaha from June to November, 1898, for the state of Washington to demonstrate to the multitude that will visit that fair the superiority and abundance of our natural resources and the ease with which our soil is made to produce in fabulous quantities.</p>
<p>That there is a woeful lack of information concerning our resources, productions and climate is well known by those of us who have visited the east during the past few years.</p>
<p>The fact of our being located in a northern latitude causes very many people, and indeed all who have not taken the pains to inform themselves, to suppose we have very long and very cold winters.</p>
<p>The following question was asked one of our citizens by a very intelligent and otherwise well informed business man in the city of Chicago: "How do you manage during your long, cold winters when the sound is frozen up?" Such a question is only a sample of the condition of mind concerning this country and its capabilities.</p>
<p>To develop our native resources and put the state of Washington in the front rank among the states on the union, where she deservedly belongs and will eventually come, it is necessary and right that we should attract attention and impart information in such ways as we can, and no better way has so far been devised than the holding of expositions, such as is proposed to be held in Omaha. The railroads of the state are vitally concerned in the building up of trade relations for the disposal of our products and for the settlement of our broad domain with industrious people, and are ready to co-operate, as far as possible, with the people already here, to bring about the desired result, and to that end will no doubt carry free all exhibits from this state and aid in gathering such a display as will do credit to our commonwealth and result in immense good to all concerned.</p>
<p>Great Falls (Mont.) Tribune: The proposition to have a Montana exhibit at the Omaha exposition has taken a new shape. As has heretofore been said in these columns, there is every reason why the state should be represented at the gathering, and the only drawback is the lack of funds that would be necessary to accomplish the purpose. The general estimate of the cost was about $50,000, and the expenditure of such a sum at this time was out of the question. However, the committee of Omaha citizens has called upon the legislators, and out of the visit good may come. The question was not one of willingness, but of ability, and it seems that the old rule of where there's a will there's a way, was invoked with good results.</p>
<p>Among those who attended the conference was Governor Smith, and in the course of his remarks he said: "It is only proper that our resources and wealth should be presented to the world. I am satisfied that no better time nor place for such advertisements as ever offered than that made possible by the Omaha exposition of 1898, and I think it is the duty of this body to see that Montana is represented and that the public spirit of our great commonwealth be given a chance to show itself. Should this assembly see fit to make a small appropriation for this purpose. I am sure your constituents would endorse your action and that the state of Montana would be greatly benefited thereby."</p>
<p>Acting upon this suggestion of the governor, the proper committees of the legislature have already met and begun to devise a plan. It contemplates a small appropriation and the appointment of an officer on commission to represent the state and to arrange and manage details. An appeal to public-spirited citizens will be made for subscriptions, with the understanding that expenses will be reduced to the minimum. This will no doubt prove successful, and proper exhibits will follow as a matter of course. The Anaconda company has already announced its intention of making a large exhibition, and the Parrot company, which had one of the most interesting displays at the World fair, will naturally follow suit. With these examples before them the Boston and Montana and other great corporations will surely fall in line. Each of these rich concerns will pay all the expenses connected with their displays. As for the other resources of the state, they can be readily and creditably shown at small expense if there is united action on the part of those interested. The agricultural and horticultural societies of Montana should take the matter in hand at once and arrange for a display of the products of the soil. Other features will be forthcoming, but work must be begun in proper time. The railroads will certainly aid our people in their endeavors to be seen to the best advantage, and if the legislature sets the ball in motion it will arouse the proper spirit among the people and Montana will make a display that will attract as much attention as that of any other state.</p>
<p>Idaho Falls (Idaho) Register: The committee of citizens from Omaha representing the Transmississippi Exposition were in Boise City yesterday. There will undoubtedly be some opposition to a proposition to make an appropriation for the purpose of making an exhibit for Idaho. There are very few propositions that come before the legislature that do not meet with opposition. Some people are opposed to second coming of the Savior, but the very large majority of the civilized world believe in His coming, and it is hoped the opposition to an appropriation of sufficient amount to make a creditable display on the part of this state will find so little opposition that there will be no trouble in passing it. The Register believes the very great majority of the taxpayers of the state are in favor of it, and believe that $10,000 would not be a great amount to expend in this manner. A good building, costing from $6,000 to $8,000, could be erected that would be a credit to the state, and when the exposition closed could be sold for one-fourth, a least, of that amount, which, with the remainder of the appropriation, would make a good and creditable display of the products of the state.</p>
<p>Boise (Idaho) Statesman: No thoughtful citizen should need to be told that it would be a great benefit to the state to have a creditable exhibit at the exposition to be held in Omaha next year. A senator stated the other day that he did not think it would do a particle of good. Others may say the same thing but they can scarcely feel just as they talk, because it is perfectly plain that such an advertisement as can be secured for the state would bring us a great number of settlers. The state needs settlement, and it can well afford to do anything within reason to attract immigration.</p>
<p>If those who are inclined to oppose participation in the exposition on the ground that it could accomplish no good purpose had been in positions to observe the effect of other advertising efforts, they would be of a different opinion.</p>
<p>There are multitudes of people who want to know about Idaho. They are looking for new locations and are procuring all the information they can respecting every locality. When some exhibit has been made at any point, though it may have been nothing more than a few cases of goods displayed by an individual or firm, it has brought a flood of inquiries. The newspapers understand well how such displays benefit the state, for they are in constant receipt of letters asking for further information about the section that produced a particular case of fruit or a particular exhibit, such as that which was sent to the Nebraska State fair a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>We cannot hope to secure immigration unless we attract the attention of those who expect to change their places of residence. Other states in the field bidding for the prospective settlers, and if Idaho is not represented in the competition the people will be induced, almost without exception, to go elsewhere. The Omaha exposition has been planned as a great advertisement for the states west of the Missouri. It is being so arranged, and people from all the central western states will be particularly invited to come and see what is offered them in the west. It is from those states the largest portion of our immigration must come; the people from among whom the immigration of the immediate future will be drawn will generally visit the exposition for the definite purpose of gaining information of the character which it is proposed to furnish, and those states that are represented will derive all the benefit.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">SNAP SHOTS AT THE LEGISLATORS.</head>
<p>Humboldt Standard: The law requiring custodians of public moneys to give bonds should be replaced by one providing a long term of imprisonment for the official who comes out "short." This bond business has become more or less of a fake.</p>
<p>Norfolk Journal: The legislature has decided to repudiate 40 per cent of the debt the state owes the newspaper men for publishing the constitutional amendments. That will make the state just 60 per cent less a thief than the man who takes a paper several years and then stops it with a government postal card because the editor wants his pay.</p>
<p>Kearney Hub: Senator Ransom is becoming famous. Indeed, he has been more or less famous for some time, but his latest bid for fame cannot be topped by any member of the present legislature. Senator Ransom has, in short "licked" a committee clerk. Senator Ransom is a large man and the committee clerk is a small man. But this is not mentioned to detract the least little bit from Senator Ransom's laurels as a fame gatherer.</p>
<p>Stanton Register: While a great many people are criticizing the present legislature we want to remark that they have a great deal of work to do and to do it right prevents any rushing work. Our legislature in 1891 did work in a rush and passed some defective laws which cost us dearly. We don't need any new laws unless they are constitutionally enacted and have no flaws. The members there can well afford to allow the hasty ones to kick and we are satisfied they will do their work well.</p>
<p>North Platte Tribune: Representative Stebbins of this county has introduced a bill providing for an inspector of beer, wine and alcoholic liquors. This is a proper move on the part of Mr. Stebbins, and his constituents will arise as one man and thank him. For years we have been drinking whisky made from concentrated lye and rainwater and beer that often tastes like printer's paste smells. It is time that a halt was called on the adulteration of these absolute necessities of life, and as before mentioned, Brother Stebbins deserves our thanks.</p>
<p>Central City Democrat: These is a bill before the legislature to abolish passes. This is a good law and there ought not to be any question about its passage. If our representatives could not get free rides they would remain at their post of duty instead of running all over the state, and would be passing useful legislation instead of wasting the time that the people have bought and paid for. That crowd at Lincoln ought to be confined in the state house on bread and water until they redeem some of the promises they made to the people last fall.</p>
<p>Beatrice Democrat: Now the populist legislature is getting right down to business, all questions of parliamentary procedure are disposed of under the Queensburg rules. In the enforcement of one of his bills, Senator Ransom found it necessary to push in the face of the clerk of the committee of the whole. The pushing process took place in the rotunda of the Lincoln hotel, and was witnessed by the supreme court judges, the mayor of Lincoln and many other eminent authorities upon pushing. The sergeant-at-arms and the doorkeeper also had a fight.</p>
<p>Seward Reporter: The populist legislature is undertaking to regulate everything by statute and by inspectors, as is the habit of populists. One bill introduced is for a state inspector of beer. Just what the provisions of the bill are we are not informed, but as one inspector could hardly be expected to look after and test all the beer sold in the state, he would probably be obliged to have deputies in all the important towns, say one for each county. The position of deputy beer inspector would doubtless be very attractive, even at a small salary. Probably a number of populist patriots in Seward could be found who would be willing to take the place, but who would be the lucky man can hardly be conjectured.</p>
<p>Schuyler Quill: Our legislature was very generous with the people's money, and after throwing out four republican members of the house and one of the senate from Douglas county on contest, the only real reason being because they had the power, they proceed to vote pay to both contestants and contestees in a decidedly liberal manner. The members voted out were given pay up to the time they quit, and then came a move to allow them their pay of $5 per day each for the full term, and this was followed with allowing the contestants pay from the time they started the contest, which was in the first of the session. But what is the smaller portion, as the contest expenses were nearly $4,000 for each. The bill filed in the one senatorial case was for merely $4,000, and $1,500 was for the attorney on each side, making $3,000 for lawyers in each case. Those Douglas county contest cases never should have been seriously considered and were a foul blot on the record of this session&#8212;an expensive outrage.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><dateline>CITY OF MEXICO,<lb/> THE MEXICAN HERALD, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY, 27, 1897.</dateline>
    <head type="main">NEBRASKA EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">COMMITTEE OF CITIZENS RECEIVED BY PRES. DIAZ.</head>
<head type="sub">They Were Introduced by the U.S. Charge d'Affaires and Their Reception Was Cordial.</head>
<p>A committee representing the Nebraska Trans-Mississippi and International exposition, and composed of C. S. Montgomery, director and counsel for the exposition and chairman of the committee, Hon. Euclid Martin, postmaster of Omaha and ex-national commissioner of the Columbian exposition of 1893, Rev Dr. S. Wright Butler, the leading Congregational clergyman of Omaha, and Hon. E. J. Cornish, ex-city attorney and present park commissioner of Omaha, Major E. H. Crowder, judge advocate of the department of the Platte, U. S. A., and J. O. Phillips, assistant general passenger and freight agent of the Missouri Pacific Railway Co., all Omaha, and Hon. A. J. Cornish, district judge of Nebraska, residing at Lincoln, arrived in the city yesterday morning by the National railroad with a view to seeing and audience with President Diaz in the interest of the exposition. In the morning the committee called at the American legation and consulate, where they were received with great courtesy by the secretary of legation and charge d'affaires, Judge Ignacio Sepulveda, and by Governor Crittenden, respectively.</p>
<p>Through the good offices of Judge Sepulveda, the commissioners were received by President Diaz, in private audience, yesterday afternoon at the National palace. Judge Sepulveda acted as introducer and interpreter. President Diaz received the commissioners with great cordiality and impressed them, as he impresses all Americans, most favorably.</p>
<p>The following address was read to him by the chairman of the committee, Mr. C. S. Montgomery:</p>
<p>YOUR EXCELLENCY:&#8212;We consider ourselves fortunate that we are permitted to present personally to the renowned president of the great Republic of Mexico the enterprise, which we are officially authorized to represent and which is known as the trans-Mississippi and International exposition to be held at the city of Omaha in the state of Nebraska, United States of America, from June to November, 1898. West of the Mississippi river in the United States lie twenty-four states and territories covering an area of nearly 2,700,000 square miles, with a population of over 20,000,000. These states and territories are identical in certain interests, especially applicable to themselves, among which are irrigation of arid regions, the development of harbors on the gulf of Mexico, and the construction of north and south lines of railway, directly connecting the lakes of the north with the gulf on the south, the northern and southern states with each other, and all with the Republic of Mexico; all to the end that the varying products of the great West may be more easily interchanged to the benefit of all, and the present friendly and growing trade relations between the government fostered.</p>
<p>To promote and advance these and other important interests a trans-Mississippi congress was organized several years ago, which is constituted by delegates appointed by the governors of the several states and territories. At the session of this congress in November 1895, it was decided to hold a great exposition at Omaha in 1898 for the purpose of exhibiting the products, industries, resources and civilization of the trans-Mississippi country, and the United States congress was requested to authorize and promote the enterprise. Pursuant to this action the trans-Mississippi and International exposition was organized and there was expressly included in its purposes that of exhibitions by foreign countries. The organization, thus perfected, was immediately presented to the United States congress for approval, and, several months ago, an act was unanimously adopted in both houses and approved by the president, recognizing the exposition and pledging the general government to its support. At the present session of congress, a large appropriation has been granted and it is expected that our general government will expend $500,000 in aid of the enterprise, which will include a government building and an exhibit as large and as fine as has ever been furnished. Up to this time, for exposition purposes, private citizens have subscribed over $500,000 which will be at least doubled, a municipal appropriation has been made, several states have pledged support and made preliminary appropriations, and acts are now pending in the legislatures of all the other states and territories, providing for representation and appropriations there for.</p>
<p>The exposition being thus supported in our own country and its great success assured, we are now looking to other countries, and particularly to other republics, and above all to the Republic of Mexico to help make the exposition attractive by such exhibits as will reflect credit upon those who furnish them and result in such profit and benefit as necessarily follows, when the products, resources and civilization of a country are made to appear.</p>
<p>We regard the Republic of Mexico, in her excellent condition of modern advancement, as especially interested. You can greatly aid our exposition by an exhibit which cannot be excelled by any other country and perhaps hardly be equalled, and, at the same time derive therefrom those benefits which arise from a desirable immigration, an increased permanent population and the enlarged industrial development resulting from increased invested capital.</p>
<p>From what has been said, you will observe that our exposition is national in character and representative of an empire in territory and of a great people.</p>
<p>The participation of your Republic with us is earnestly desired and will most surely result in strengthening the friendly relations which already exist to so large a degree between the two Republics.</p>
<p>We come to you as an authorized committee to present in person this invitation, which in due time will be furnished in official form.</p>
<p>Having performed this pleasurable duty we bet to thank you for our most courteous reception.</p>
<p>President Diaz, in response to this address, assured the committee of this interest in the matter, and said that, upon receipt of the formal invitation from the proper authorities, his government would take steps for a representation of the Republic of Mexico at the exposition. The committee retired, well pleased with the result of the interview.</p>
<p>The committee is stopping at the Iturbide hotel and will remain here several days viewing the city, visiting its numerous points of interest and investigating generally the resources of the Republic.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">A Nebraska Delegation.</head>
<p>Last night the committee of the Nebraska exposition left this city by the National en route for Omaha.</p>
<p>Monday evening Messrs. Montgomery and Phillipi were presented by Judge Sepulveda, U. S. charge d'affaires, to the minister of encouragement, Hon. Manuel Fernandez Leal, and they had a long and pleasant interview with that functionary in regard to the participation of Mexico in the trans-Mississippi exposition. The minister promised that if Mexico was represented he would use all his experience and endeavors in making the exhibit of this country a complete success. It may be mentioned that Mr. Fernandez Leal's experience in this particular is very extensive, as he has had more or less direct control of the preparation of exhibits for all foreign expositions since that of New Orleans.</p>
<p>The remainder of the party, i. e., all with the exception of Messrs Montgomery, the president of the committee, and Mr. Phillipi, made a brief trip to Orizaba and Cordova, and returned greatly impressed with the beauties and resources of tropical Mexico.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that Mexico will be represented at this exposition, for, in view of the movement in the United States in the direction of investments in this country, it is quite certain that, any money spent in affording to the inhabitants of the northern republic an adequate idea of the resources of Mexico will be repaid a hundredfold.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">People object to the Proposed Place.</head>
<p>A week or so ago the DAILY TRIBUNE made the statement that a movement was on the run to secure the relocation of the Transmississippi site and that none of us need be surprised should it succeed. Today this statement is verified 

<pb n="131" xml:id="TMISB02-131"/>
    
by the World-Herald whose proprietor, Hitchcock, is supposed to be next to everything that is being done by the board. In its article on the subject it gives the superintendent of construction credit for suggesting the change, and says that he is in favor of the old fair grounds as the site. His preferences were made known a day or two after his arrival, and his arguments have been so seductive that several of the craziest Miller Park supporters have been won over to his views. One of the reasons for the seductiveness of his arguments to these people is that they own land thereabouts, Kountz and Redick being the heaviest holders. As the Hanscom Park people are anxious to see the show located within a day's journey of the city all are in favor of the proposed site. A combination of these forces is already nearly strong enough to effect a reconsideration of the vote that selected Miller Park, and the boom in favor of the fair ground site is believed to be steadily growing. It is undoubtedly true that Miller park has lost a portion of its popularity with every one of the directors. Calm and thorough investigations <choice><sic>haye</sic><corr>have</corr></choice> taught them a number of disadvantages of the place to which they were blind when they voted for it. They know now that it is the most expensive site they could select, and that it will be the least profitable.</p>
<p>The blundersome career riotously run by the leading directors and stockholders is bringing in discouraging returns to such an extent that they have about given up caring whether school keeps or not. In return for the Omaha hoggishness displayed by them they have got a small appropriation from the government, a few $10,000 appropriations from other states, and practically nothing from its own.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><dateline>SOUTH OMAHA, NEBRASKA, MARCH 11, 1897</dateline>
    <head type="main">TO POSTPONE.</head>
<head type="sub">No Exposition as early as Next Year.</head>
<head type="sub">Opening of the Big Show Must be Postponed</head>
<head type="sub">For at Least a Year and Perhaps Two.</head>
<head type="sub">No Funds is One of the Reasons.</head>
<p>The brownies herewith stake their reputation as telescopes into the future on the dual prediction that the transmississippi congress will be postponed at least one year and that it will not be held in Miller Park. It has been plain to observing men for some time that lightning-like work would have to be done before any kind of a respectable show could be pulled off in 1898, and that it would be impossible to do so because of the scarcity of money and the difficulty in getting it. A very liberal appropriation was made in the south for the Nashville exposition but it took four years to do the preparatory work, and everything is only now about in readiness for its opening. It has been nearly two years since the Trans-Mississippi project was broached but not a move has been made toward commencing the mechanic or even engineeric preparations for it. Only a year stands between the present and the date of the opening and yet scarcely a dollar of the measly appropriations thus far made for it is available for use. Under the easiest sailing the government appropriation will not be available for four or five months; there is danger of it not being made at all. The 2-cent appropriation will not come in until a very large per cent of the subscriptions to the local stock are paid in, and they are not being receipted for with that degree of celerity that suffuses the faces of the directors with smiles of satisfaction. The board is therefore trying to get up an exposition that will be a credit to the entire west without a dollar in the treasury, and no prospect of having one within the next six months. Expositions can no easier be built up without money <choice><sic>aud</sic><corr>and</corr></choice> plenty of it, too, than a newspaper or a prize fight, and our big show will simply have to be postponed until the funds are raised. If it is the intention to give something else than a pumpkin show or a poultry exhibit it will take two years after the funds are raised to do it. By 1899 if the money is raised at once the performance may be properly commenced, but it looks as if the year 1900 would be the best to postpone to. Under the cover the matter has been thoroughly talked over by the directors, and a postponement may be looked for in the near future.</p>
<p>Miller Park must be abandoned as the site. It would take an ocean of money to put it in readiness for the buildings and the board cannot raise the money. Another site must and will be chosen.</p></div2>

The Lincoln charter and the treasury vault bills, both special orders for today, will doubtless be completed by tonight or by tomorrow noon. The exposition bill is almost certain to pass tomorrow afternoon.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">EXPOSITION DIRECTORS TO MEET.</head>
<head type="sub">Change of Location to be Brought Up for Consideration.</head>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Transmississippi Exposition association will hold its regular monthly meeting next Friday afternoon at 4 o'clock. The impression exists among the members of the directory that the regular meetings occur on Saturday, but the bylaws provide that the regular meetings of the board shall be held at 4 o'clock p. m. on the first Friday after the first Saturday of each month. The meeting will be held in the directors' room in the Paxton block.</p>
<p>It is expected that the question of changing for location of the exposition will come up for consideration at this meeting and there are a few other matters which are being very generally discussed among the members of the board informally, but very earnestly, which may be brought before the meeting, in which even the proceedings will be of a highly interesting nature.</p>
<p>The resolution introduced some time ago by Director F. M. Youngs, providing that unskilled labor shall be paid a minimum wage of $1.50 per day and also that residents of Douglas county shall be given preference in all work done by the exposition management, will probably form the subject of discussion. This resolution was referred to the executive committee, but has never been reported back to the board.</p>
<ab>Coming Back from South Dakota.</ab>
<p>A telegram was received at exposition headquarters this morning from Chairman Lindsey of the executive committee, who has been snowbound in Pierre, the capital of South Dakota, for over a week. It was dated at Hawarden, Ia., and contained a brief statement to the effect that the party of exposition promoters had reached that point and would be home this evening. Mr. Lindsey's party consisted of J. R. Clarkson and Judge Scott of this city, and E. C. Caldwell, a newspaper man of Sioux City. They had been in Pierre several days, awaiting the approach of spring so that the snow would melt sufficiently to allow the passage of trains. The receipt of a telegram from a little town in western Iowa has awakened all sorts of surprise in the minds of the people about exposition headquarters in this <choice><sic>city. city.</sic><corr>city.</corr></choice></p></div2>

<head type="sub">Exposition Promoters Return and Are Very Much Encouraged, Notwithstanding the Adverse Action of the Dakota Legislature.</head>
<p>The party of exposition promoters which visited Pierre, S. D., returned home last night after an absence of about ten days. the party was snowbound in Pierre for fully a week and was in blissful ignorance of all that was transpiring in the world outside of the narrow confines of the South Dakota capital.</p>
<p>Chairman Z. T. Lindsey of the exposition executive committee, who was in charge of the party, said last night that he felt the trip had been a fruitful one in many respects. He said that while the legislature of South Dakota had adjourned without making an appropriation for a state exhibit, the snow storm which had kept the exposition delegation in Pierre had also kept the entire legislature at the capital and the party had made the best of the opportunity offered to fully acquaint the members of the legislature, as well as all the other people in the city, with the full details regarding the exposition. Mr. Lindsey expressed the opinion that the state of South Dakota would be represented at the exposition by a most creditable exhibit. This would be accomplished, he said, by appropriations by the several counties. The law of South Dakota provides for the voting of money for such purposes by the counties and Mr. Lindsey said this matter had been urged with full force to the members, almost without exception, had seemed to take a marked interest in the matter and had said they would take the matter up as soon as they reached their homes. In this manner Mr. Lindsey said he felt confident that the state would be represented fully as well as it could have been had the legislature appropriated a large sum of money.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">THREAT AGAINST EXPOSITION MOVEMENT</head>
<head type="sub">Author of the Circular Declares that if a change of Site is Made Dire Disaster Will Follow.</head>
<p>An anonymous circular was circulated very generally this morning about the business portions of the city and especially about the exposition headquarters in the Paxton block and in localities where the members of the Board of Directors of the exposition have their places of business. The effusion was printed in the form of a small dodger and was as follows:</p>
<p>"No exposition! That is the general opinion currently expressed by men of sound mind. If the directors attempt to re-locate said site it will be at a loss of thousands of dollars to the city of Omaha in the way of permanent improvements. Men that have taken stock will refuse to pay any more on said stock and disaster will stare you in the face. Come, gentlemen, don't 'play horse,' but get down to business and set the ball to rolling, so that the men of toil can go to work."</p>
<p>Inquiry among the representatives of organized labor developed the fact that none of them knew anything about the issuing of the circular, and one and all denied that it represented the sentiment of the laboring people. One of the men who is regarded as being fully in touch with the labor element said that the general sentiment among the laboring men was in favor of the change of site which has been suggested.</p>
<p>"We would rather have the exposition located on Sherman avenue," said this man, "than to have it at Miller park, because a laboring man would either have to spend 10 cents every day in car fare or walk several miles to work in the morning and walk the same distance at night after a hard day's work if no change is made, but if it is located at the old fair grounds site the men can easily walk both ways, and a saving of 60 cents each week is a very important item to a working man. All we want is work, and we are not so particular where it is located, but when it comes to a choice between those two places we are in favor of the one nearest to town."</p>
<p>One of the directors, who has taken an interest in the proposed change of site and who has looked into the matter very carefully since the change was suggested, said today that it was not true that the city would lose anything in the way of permanent improvements if the change suggested was made. He said that Herman Kountze had already agreed to donate a parcel of land to the city as a site for a permanent building and a public park and this would enable the Board of Park Commissioners to devote the proceeds of the levy made for park purposes to the improvement of this part of the city, exactly the same as was proposed in connection with the Miller park site.</p>
<p>Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds and Dion Geraldine, superintendent of construction under Mr. Kirkendall, have been getting ready to commence work whenever the question of location is definitely settled. Mr. Kirkendall says he will commence throwing dirt Monday morning if definite action is taken by the Board of Directors. The first thing to be done will be the erection of a high board fence around the grounds in order to keep out the people who will undoubtedly congregate about the place. Preliminary steps have been taken in this matter, and as soon as the location question is settled the material for the fence will be ordered and the work will then commence in earnest and be pushed with a rapidity which will produce tangible results in a very short time.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors will meet at 4 o'clock this afternoon, but it is not anticipated that anything will be done except to adjourn until tomorrow afternoon, as many of the directors are out of the city and will not return until tomorrow.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">BEFORE THE SENATE FOR CONSIDERATION</head>
<head type="sub">Transmississippi Appropriation Gets the Right-of-Way in the Upper House of the Nebraska Legislature.</head>
<p>LINCOLN, March 12.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The senate spent the entire forenoon on the bill to repeal the state depository law and to build a large vault in the state house for the protection of state funds. The bill was not completed, and will be taken up again next Monday afternoon. This clears the way for the consideration of the exposition bill, which will be taken up this afternoon.</p>
<p>The senate took up the Transmississippi Exposition at 2:30 o'clock this afternoon, going into committee of the whole immediately after the noon recess, with McGann of Boone in the chair. The first section was agreed to without objection.</p>
<p>To the second section, which creates the state commission, Caldwell of Nuckolls offered an amendment doing away with the commission and placing the expenditure of the appropriation in the hands of the State Board of Agriculture. The motion was defeated.</p>
<p>Ransom moved that the proviso which prohibits the governor from appointing any member of the present legislature on the state commission be stricken out. The motion was not agreed to.</p>
<p>Caldwell of Nuckolls offered an amendment to section 3, limiting the time for which the commissioners may draw salaries of eight months. The amendment was lost.</p>
<p>When the fourth section was reached Murphy of Gage offered an amendment increasing the amount of the appropriation from $100,000 to $150,000. Canaday of Kearney moved as a further amendment that the amount be cut down to $50,000.</p>
<p>At 3:30 it is apparent the senate will increase the amount carried by the bill to $150,000.</p>
<p>Jenkins, in the house this morning, succeeded in killing senate file No. 173, providing for an assessment on all state banks on one-fourth of 1 per cent to secure depositors. The bill was indefinitely postponed by a vote of 45 to 32. Yeiser failed again to get his resolution condemning the Omaha city council for granting franchises last Monday night before the house. Rich's bill providing for the sale one execution of stock in corporations, and Hull's measure to prevent adulterations of cider both passed. Wooster's bill prescribing what shall be a legal tender in Nebraska failed to pass with the emergency clause, and was passed with out it by a vote of 61 to 25.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">MEMBERSHIP OF THE BOARD IS COMPLETE</head>
<head type="sub">Meetings Will Be Held in the Directors' Room in This City, an Organization Perfected and Plans Adopted.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The executive committee of the Transmississippi and International Exposition has directed Secretary Wakefield to call a meeting of the Board of Lady Managers to be held in this city on Tuesday, April 6.</p>
<p>The board is composed of the following members: Miss Anna Foos, Mrs. W. W. Keysor, Miss Kate McHugh, Miss Alice Hitte, Mrs. Orietta Crittenden, Mrs. W. P. Harford, Mrs. E. A. Cudahy, Mrs. J. H. McIntosh, Mrs. S. R. Towne, Mrs. T. L. Kimball and Mrs. Euclid Martin of Omaha, Mrs. E. B. Towl and Mrs. A. A. Munro of South Omaha, Mrs. Edith M. E. Read and Mrs. Sarah C. Key of Council Bluffs, Mrs. A. J. Sawyer and Mrs. A. W. Field of Lincoln, Mrs. Omar Whitney of Elk City, Miss Helen Chase of Papillion, Mrs. D. C. Giffert of West Point, Mrs. Nettie Knox Hollenbeck of Fremont, Mrs. J. B. McDowell of Fairbury, Mrs. Frank Johnson of Crete, Mrs. C. L. Kerr of Ansley, Mrs. Hattie Hunter of Broken Bow, Mrs. William Dutton and Mrs. L. W. Fike of Hastings.</p>
<p>The meeting will be held in the directors' room in the Paxton block and will be the first meeting of the board being called to perfect an organization and plan for its work.</p>
<p>The executive committee of the exposition held its first meeting in over three weeks yesterday afternoon. There was a large amount of routine business to be disposed of, and the session was mostly given up to the consideration of bills. All the members of the committee were present except Mr. Babcock.</p>
<p>Editor Dockerty of the Transmississippi Magazine presented the committee with a design for use on the exposition stationary and for use on the envelopes of such business firms as desire it. The design is circular in form, the full name of the exposition association being inscribed around the perimeter. The central figure is a woman pointing to the various products of agricultural and commerce lying about her. The design was adopted as the official emblem of the exposition.</p>
<p>Secretary Wakefield called attention to the fact that the Board of Lady Managers was completed by the election of the two women at the meeting held at Hastings yesterday afternoon and asked instruction regarding calling the women together to organize. He was instructed to call a meeting of the board to be held in the directors' room in Omaha the first Tuesday in April.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WATER FOR THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>E. Rosewater called attention to the fact that the settlement with the Omaha Water company which was approved by the city council at the meeting Tuesday night does not contain any provision for supplying free water to the exposition. This provision was contained in the proposition as originally drawn and was understood to be satisfactory to the water company, but Mr. Rosewater said that its absence would be a very objectionable feature from an exposition standpoint. A committee, consisting of Mr. Rosewater and President Wattles, was appointed to confer with the water works manager and endeavor to have this provision incorporated in the agreement.</p>
<p>The bills of the delegations which visited the several transmississippi states in the interest of the exposition were presented and ordered paid. The southern party, in charge of C. S. Montgomery, rendered a bill aggregating $571, of which it was explained by Mr. Montgomery that about $200 represented money paid for railway fares in Mexico. Mr. Montgomery said the party had been unsuccessful in getting transportation in Mexico, but steps had been taken at the headquarters of the Mexican railway to refund the money and it was expected that this would be done. The party which went to the Pacific coast presented a bill for $363; and Z. T. Lindsey presented a bill for $244 covering the expenses of the two trips taken to states to the north by the parties under his direction.</p>
<p>It was suggested that a large number of the directors will not be in the city today and that it would be wise to adjourn the meeting of the board of directors from this afternoon until tomorrow afternoon in order to secure a larger attendance. In accordance with this suggestion, it is expected that when the directors meet this afternoon they will adjourn over until tomorrow.</p></div3></div2>

<p>That is the general opinion currently expressed by men of sound mind. If the directors attempt to re-locate said site it will be at a loss of thousands of dollars to the City of Omaha in the way of permanent improvements. Men that have taken stock will refuse to pay any more on said stock, and disaster will stare you in the face. Come, gentlemen, don't "play horse," but get down to business, and set the ball to rolling, so that the men of toil can go to work.</p></div2>

<ab>FIFTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY,</ab>
<ab>STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA.</ab>
<ab>Concurrent Resolution.</ab>
<p>WHEREAS, there is to be held in the city of Omaha, Nebraska, in the summer of 1898, an exposition to be known as the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, being distinctively an exposition of the industries of the states and territories west of the Mississippi,</p>
<p>BE IT RESOLVED, by the senate of the state of South Dakota, the house of representatives concurring, that we express our deep interest in the approval of the ends and purposes of said exposition, and it is the sense of this legislature that by private subscription, and otherwise, the people of this state should do everything in their power to secure at such exposition a creditable exhibit of all the varied interests and resources of South Dakota, and we recommend  a liberal patronage of the same by our people.</p>
<p>This exposition will be of immense benefit to the northwest and our resources should be shown there. Now that no aid can be expected <choice><sic>rom</sic><corr>from</corr></choice> the state, everyone who feels an interest in the state's welfare should help push the matter along.

<head type="sub">Danger of Disreputable Surroundings Will Be Avoided.</head>
<head type="sub">SOME FRICTION IN MANAGEMENT</head>
<head type="sub">Family in a  Burning Wagon Behind Running Horses Fatally Burned&#8212;Bootblack's Injunction.</head>
<p>OMAHA, March 16.&#8212;In all probability tomorrow, Wednesday, the trans-Mississippi exposition site will be changed by the board of directors. The site selected, Miller park, is nearly four miles north of Farnam street and while from a scenic point it is by far the superior of all the proposed sites; still, it is undesirable for several reasons. Perhaps the two most objectionable ones being the distance and the fact that outsiders have secured options upon all the immediate vacant property for the purpose of side shows, erecting beer gardens, etc. In order that no objectionable features may be located near the exposition grounds and that no Stoney Island avenue incidents may be repeated, Mr. F. J. Kirkendall, manager of the department of buildings and grounds, assisted by the superintendent of the same department, Dion Geraldine, have secured options upon all the vacant lots surrounding the new proposed site, previous to the announcement that such a change was possible. This obviates the possibility of anything but a clean, respectable vicinity with no exhibitions except those under the control of A. L. Reed, managers of the department of concessions. While the proposed site is called the old fair grounds site for convenience sake, it should not be interpreted to mean only the old fair grounds where the state fair was held previous to twelve years ago when Omaha had the fair before. It includes upwards of 160 acres, including the forty acres owned by Herman Kountze, forty acres of old fair grounds owned by J. J. Brown and forty acres known as Oak Chatham addition owned by John I. Redick, as well as the sixty-acre strip of land lying east of Sherman avenue (Sixteenth street) north of Locust street, which is to be used as a Midway. It is quite apparent that the new location is preferable from many standpoints and when it is understood that the entrance to the grounds is only a mile and a half north of Farnam street it goes without saying that the attendance and gate receipts will be largely increased. There is little doubt but that this change in the site could have been made on Saturday last at the directors' meeting, had it not been for the one fact, that those most interested desired to get concessions from the large property owners in the way of land donations for park purposes. Every foot of ground necessary had already been secured without cost, but the exposition directors being desirous of erecting a permanent building upon ground belonging to the city of Omaha, desired to get Herman Kountze to donate five or more acres to the city, facing upon the Twentieth street and Florence boulevard, for a public park, upon which a suitable building might be erected. This concession has been secured and as it is reported, it donates six acres of the Kountze property upon the east side of the boulevard, giving the city a three years' option upon six acres immediately opposite on the west side of the boulevard at a very reasonable figure. It is true that the forty-acred Kountze tract will be connected on the north with the forty-acre old fair ground tract by a strip of ground 300 feet long and 300 feet wide, which gives the site perhaps the appearance of being cut up, but this only apparent objectionable feature will compensate for the numerous objectionable short-comings of the Miller park site.</p>
<p>Manager Kirkendall is extremely anxious to break ground and it is very probable that the first work upon the big exposition will be the erection of a high board fence around the entire grounds within a very few days&#8212;either at Miller park or the old fair grounds&#8212;whichever is finally settled upon tomorrow and but little doubt remains of the proposed change. In fact it is expected that less than five of the fifty directors will vote against it, and those quite probably from personal reasons.</p>
<p>While everything apparent on the surface is smooth sailing with the managers of the exposition, it is known to those upon the inside that much rough sea has been encountered by several of the seven managers of the departments which go to make up the executive committee, and in fact so much of it that some seasickness has been experienced. It is understood that the secretary of the board of directors, John A. Wakefield, has insisted not only upon being present at each meeting of the executive committee without being requested but that he, to use an expressive term, "sticks his oar in" more than is necessary. This of course does not voice the sentiment of the entire executive committee, but the fact remains, however, that Mr. Wakefield makes but an indifferent secretary to say the least. His minutes of previous meetings sound like those of a school boy. His "marble heart" freezes those outside the directory calling upon him for information, and his arbitrary way of disposing of communications sent him without referring them to the executive committee is quite suggestive of the selection by him of a spring tile of considerable increased proportions. The board of managers while supposedly consisting of seven, apparently consists of nine, because both the secretary and president of the directors have a watchful eye and a suggestive presence at all of the committee meetings. It is quite possible that the secretary's presence would not be objectionable, if it were not for the fact that he insists upon running the whole business himself, without being asked for advice. Rumors make it quite probable that the selection of another secretary would be desirable to perhaps a majority of the directors. That the president of the directory is overly anxious to be made one of the board of managers is an open secret, but President Wattles has given the exposition much though and might be excused for having such aspirations. Until he is made one of the managers, however, certain members can see no necessity for his neglecting his banking business to give his time to the management of affairs in which he is not supposed to have a voice.</p></div2>

<p>OMAHA, Neb., March 17.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;By the unanimous vote of twenty-nine members present at the meeting of the board of directors of the trans-Mississippi exposition this afternoon and by the affirmative proxy vote of eight who were not there, the site of the exposition was changed from Miller park to the old fair grounds. Mr. Kirkendall the manager of the department of buildings and grounds, says that the work will now be pushed forward as rapidly as possible. Mr. Geraldine, superintendent of construction, says that the first thing to do will be to prepare a topographical map of the ground arrange the general plan of them and put up the fencing. Bids on the material for fencing have already been received. It is thought that the first dirt can be thrown in a few days.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">AS TO SECRETARY WAKEFIELD.</head>
<p>The directors of the trans-Mississippi exposition are necessarily conservative business men and do not care to start an open warfare against the arbitrarily inclined secretary, who heretofore has had as much or more to say than the managers, but hope is entertained that Mr. Wakefield will see the error of his ways and make amends by keeping "his face closed" and doing the work the same as any other hired servant. The mild rebuke administered in these, columns yesterday the Secretary Wakefield was a general topic among directors and it was acknowledged a not unjust or overdrawn criticism by a number of them.</p>
<p>As an instance of his way of handling the trans-Mississippi documents it is quite proper to state that a committee of five members of the advertising men's club was recently appointed to wait upon the state fair managers and the trans-Mississippi managers, as well, to protest against the official <choice><sic>indorsement</sic><corr>endorsement</corr></choice> of any publication as an official organ. When this committee, on Monday last, called upon Mr. Wakefield to ascertain what, if any disposition had been made by the executive committee of a communication sent him by the advertising men's club, intimation having previously been received that he had pigeon-holed it, they were <choice><sic>surpised</sic><corr>surprised</corr></choice> at their unbusiness-like and ungentlemanly reception. Instead of giving the information requested in a manner befitting the dignity of his position, he deliberately insulted and roasted them to a turn, for adding to desire information as to what he had done with their communication and stated that he had decided to use his own sweet pleasure in disposing of communications. The committee withdrew after stating they had come for information they had supposed would be freely given and on Tuesday called upon Managers Reed, Hitchcock and Rosewater, representing the departments of concessions, promotion and publicity respectively, and informed these gentlemen of the arbitrary decision of Secretary Wakefield, to dispose of communications that in justice to the board of managers should be referred to either a department manager or to the full board. The committee received assurance from each of the three managers that it was not their intention to allow Mr. Wakefield such authority and the advertising men's club's communication will now receive proper recognition even if the secretary has destroyed it, which is apparently the opinion of the five gentlemen who called upon him.</p>
<p>That Secretary Wakefield is personally interested in some publication which it is proposed to spring upon the managers is the opinion of the advertising men's club. This is expressing it in milder terms than the way the members of the club state it. It has also been intimated that Wakefield having been in the lumber business previously, desires to be in a position to direct the extensive purchase of lumber to be used in building the exposition, but this the managers would not be apt to allow. It was learned today that a movement is about to be made to appoint C. A. Starr, a gentleman of diplomacy and now clerk to the committee on ways and means, as clerk to the board of managers also. This action it is thought, might go far toward the desired relief.</p></div3></div2>

    <head type="main">PASSES THE EXPOSITION BILL</head>
<head type="sub">SENATE ADOPTS THE AMENDED MEASURE</head>
<head type="sub">Four of the Fusion Members Vote in the Negative&#8212;Bill Goes Back to the House for Concurrence.</head>
    <div3>
<p>LINCOLN, March 13.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The Transmississippi Exposition bill, carrying an appropriation of $100,000, was read the third time in the senate at 11 o'clock this forenoon and passed by a vote of 25 to 4. The four senators voting in the negative were: Dundas, Canaday, Ritchie and Osborn. The bill was immediately sent to the house where it doubtless will be concurred in without debate.</p>
<p>The bill was recommended for passage by the senate in committee of the whole late last evening. It had been under consideration all afternoon.</p>
<p>The bill was taken up section by section. The first one was read and agreed to without objection. When the second section was read, providing for the appointment by the governor of six commissioners to manage the Nebraska exhibit, Mr. Caldwell of Nuckolls offered an amendment doing away with the state commission and providing that the appropriation contemplated by the bill should be expended under the direction of the State Board of Agriculture. The amendment was rejected without debate.</p>
<p>To the same section Mr. Ransom moved to strike out the proviso aimed to prevent the governor from appointing as members of the state commission any member of the present legislature. The committee declined to adopt the amendment.</p>
<p>The next amendment was offered by Mr. Caldwell to section 3. In the bill this section provides that the members of the state commission appointed by the governor shall draw compensation at the rate of $50 per month for a period of not longer than fifteen months. Mr. Caldwell wanted the limit cut down to eight months, but his amendment was rejected with little discussion.</p>
<p>Two amendments to section 4 opened up the main discussion on the bill. Mr. Murphy offered one fixing the amount appropriated by the bill at $150,000 instead of $100,000, as provided by the house. Mr. Canaday of Kearney offered a second amendment reducing the house appropriation to $50,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Ransom said the proposition of the senator from Kearney was too absurd to merit even a moments consideration. He said that it was almost an insult to the intelligence of the senate and he asked the senator to withdraw it.</p>
<p>"I'll withdraw my amendment if the senator from Gage will withdraw his," was the response of the senator from Kearney.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">DISCUSSING THE AMOUNT.</head>
<p>Mr. Lee of Boyd said that he was opposed to Canaday's amendment. He did not believe, as a matter of fact, that the state could afford to appropriate a single dollar for the exposition; but the exposition was a fixed fact and inasmuch as it was to be held, he did not believe in making an inadequate appropriation. He felt that he could justify himself to his constituents by voting for the amendment offered by the senator from Gage.</p>
<p>Mr. Dundas made a lengthy speech in favor of reducing the amount to $50,000. He claimed that Nebraska had nothing but a few cattle and pumpkins to exhibit, and even in these the state would be outclassed by all its neighboring states.</p>
<p>Mr. Beal expressed himself in favor of an appropriation of $100,000, and no more.</p>
<p>Mr. Mutz spoke strongly in favor of $150,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Talbot of Lancaster opposed a larger appropriation than $100,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Caldwell of Nuckolls said he would have to vote against the bill if the amount was raised above $100,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Murphy spoke eloquently in favor of making the amount $150,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Ransom closed the debate, reviewing all the arguments offered in opposition to the increased appropriation. When he had finished a vote was taken on the amendment offered by Canaday, fixing the amount at $50,000. Only three senators, Canaday, Dundas and Osborne, favored it.</p>
<p>The amendment offered by Senator Murphy was rejected by a close vote, eleven senators voting for and thirteen against.</p>
<p>Mr. Ransom then offered an amendment providing that the money appropriated should not be available until the stockholders of the exposition company had paid in at least $100,000. The bill, as the house passed it, fixed the amount at $200,000. The amendment was agreed to without objection.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee offered an amendment providing that the money should not be available until congress had appropriated $200,000, with the approval of the president of the United States. This amendment was rejected and the committee then rose and recommended that the bill be passed.</p>
<p>The senate then adjourned.</p></div3></div2>

<head type="sub">President Woodburg Tires of the Assault Made Upon the Water Works Company and Declares Himself.</head>
<p>One result of last night's demonstration in regard to the water works question has been the refusal of the Omaha Water company to make any concessions whatever to the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
<p>Since last Thursday President Wattles and E. Rosewater of the executive committee have been negotiating with the water company for the best possible concessions for the exposition. After a great deal of telegraphing between Omaha and New York, it was agreed that the water company would donate 500,000 gallons of water per day during the period of construction and 1,500,000 gallons a day during the 150 days which the exposition would be open. The papers were to have been signed this morning, but after Manager Bierbower had telegraphed to New York the hostile attitude assumed last night towards the water company, he received instructions not to make any concessions whatever. The value of the concessions thus sacrificed, when computed at the lowest meter rates is upwards of $18,000.</p></div2>

<p>Whereas, A public demand has arisen for the location of the exposition at a point as near as possible to the business center of the city; therefore,</p>
<p>Resolved, That it is the sense of this board that if proper arrangements can be made the old fair grounds site should be selected as the location for the exposition.</p>
<p>For action upon this matter the president is hereby authorized to appoint a special committee of three, consisting of the president, manager of the Department of Buildings and Grounds and Mr. Wharton, to consider the details of a proposition to locate at the old fair grounds site; this committee shall report in full at an adjourned session of this board to be held at 4 p. m. Wednesday, March 17.</p>
<p>The above resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of the Transmississippi Exposition at its meeting yesterday afternoon after a  session lasting an hour and a half, during which the board wrestled with parliamentary law and became badly tangled in its meshes.</p>
<p>The trouble commenced when a motion was made to reconsider the vote whereby Miller park was decided upon as a site for the exposition. The supporters of that location suspected that this might be a trap set for them and opposed the attempt to thus throw open the whole subject again. They insisted that the vote should not be reconsidered until a definite proposition was received from the owners of land proposed to be used in the vicinity of the old fair grounds.</p>
<p>Then the other side thought it smelled a mouse and soon the air was full of rumors about the possibility of an injunction to restrain the board from reconsidering its action at a subsequent meeting. And so it went for an hour and a half.</p></div3>
     <div3>   
<head type="sub">LITTLE OPPOSITION TO A CHANGE.</head>
<p>The matter was finally settled by the adoption of the resolution quoted above and by laying on the table until the adjourned meeting a motion to reconsider the vote on location. It was understood by all parties that no opposition would be made to the change to the old fair grounds whenever a definite and favorable proposition is submitted for the use of that ground.</p>
<p>The following directors were present at the meeting: Carpenter, Evans, Farrell, Hibbard, Hitchcock, Hussie, Jardine, Johnson, Kilpatrick, Kirkendall, Korty, Kountze, Lee, Lindsey, Markel, Montgomery, Noyes, Payne, Price, Reed, Rosewater, Rector, A. C. Smith, Thompson, Webster, Weller, Wharton, Wilcox, Wilhelm, Yost and Youngs&#8212;31.</p>
<p>The first business transacted was the reading of the report of the committee appointed to audit the accounts of the secretary up to the time of the organization of the new Board of Directors. This committee consisted of G. H. Payne, A. T. Rector and I. W. Carpenter. The committee reported as follows: Total stock subscription to December 2, 1896, $404,720; receipts on assessments, $18,015; expenditures, $3,898.36; balance turned over to new organization, 14,116.64.</p>
<p>Mr. Lindsey, for the executive committee, reported back without recommendation the labor resolution introduced by Director Youngs and referred to the executive committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Webster offered a resolution which he said he intended as a substitute for the one reported by Mr. Lindsey. His resolution was as follows:</p>
<p>Resolved, That all contracts for work pertaining to the Transmississippi Exposition entered into by this board, its officers or agents, shall stipulate that unskilled labor shall receive at least $1.50 per day, eight hours to be regarded as a full day.</p>
<p>Mr. Webster said he thought this resolution would remove the objection to the former resolution, restricting the employment to Douglas county laborers. He also explained his position by saying that in the depressed condition of the labor market many people might be induced to work for low wages, and he deprecated any attempt to take advantage of the misfortunes of these people.</p></div3>
       <div3> 
<head type="sub">TEN HOURS FOR A DAY.</head>
<p>Mr. Lindsey moved as an amendment that ten hours be fixed as the number of hours in a working day.</p>
<p>Mr. Hussie supported the Webster resolution as offered.</p>
<p>Director Youngs, labor's representative, supported the Webster substitute for his own resolution and adduced the arguments in its favor from a laboring man's standpoint. He urged the rejection of the amendment.</p>
<p>Mr. Carpenter thought the resolution would bring in a flood of laborers from all over the country, and would be a bad thing.</p>
<p>The amendment was then carried, <choice><sic>their</sic><corr>there</corr></choice> being but few nays heard against it. The resolution was then unanimously adopted as amended.</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchcock brought up the real business of the meeting by introducing a resolution providing that the vote whereby the exposition was located at Miller park be reconsidered. In the same connection Mr. Hitchcock read the resolution appearing at the beginning of this article, explaining that he would offer it after the resolution to reconsider had been adopted.</p>

<p>Mr. Youngs made the point of order that Mr. Hitchcock had voted against Miller park and could not move a reconsideration.</p>
<p>The point of order was sustained and Mr. Rector then moved a reconsideration of the vote on location.</p>
<p>Mr. Webster suggested that the advisability of changing the site should be settled before a reconsideration of the present location. He therefore moved to lay the motion to reconsider on the table until the report of the committee provided for in Mr. Hitchcock's resolution should be received.</p>
<p>Mr. Weller wanted to know if anybody knew of the advantages to be gained by making a change.</p>
<p>Mr. Kirkendall answered this by detailing the causes and incidents leading up to the movement in favor of the change, and the labor resolution introduced by Director Youngs and referred to the executive committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Webster offered a resolution which he said he intended as a substitute for the one reported by Mr. Lindsey. His resolution was as follows:</p>

advantages to be gained, saying that the details regarding the use of land at the fair grounds had not been completed.</p>
<p>After this explanation Mr. Weller opposed taking any action until the arrangements were complete.</p></div3>
    <div3>    
<head type="sub">CHANGE IS DESIRABLE.</head>
<p>Mr. Rosewater went somewhat into detail as to why an opportunity to locate the exposition one and one-half miles nearer town should be taken advantage of. He said the change would be worth thousands of dollars in gate receipts alone, and he advocated the reconsideration of the vote on Miller park at once.</p>
<p>When the question on the motion to lay on the table was about to be put Mr. Hitchcock called for a roll call in order that several telegraphic proxies from Murphy, Holdrege, Babcock and others might be voted.</p>
<p>This started a wrangle, which promised to last all night, and motions and amendments were made and withdrawn and all were discussed at great length. It was evident that each side was afraid the other intended to take some unseen advantage and both sides were sparring for wind.</p>
<p>The difficulty was finally settled by all motions being withdrawn and then Mr. Hitchcock's resolution providing for a committee of three to investigate the old fair grounds site was offered and was adopted with only one vote, Yost, against it.</p>
<p>Mr. Rector renewed his motion to reconsider the vote whereby Miller park was selected, adding a proviso that after such reconsideration no sites except Miller park or the old fair grounds should be considered.</p>
<p>Mr. Webster renewed his motion to lay on the table until 4 p. m. next Wednesday, and this motion was adopted.</p>
<p>On motion of Mr. Hitchcock directors unable to be present at Wednesday's meeting will be allowed to give their proxies.</p>
<p>The board then took a recess until Wednesday.</p></div3></div2>

<p>LINCOLN, March 13.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The following letter was read to the house this afternoon:</p>
<p>OMAHA, March 12.&#8212;To the Honorable Speaker of the House, Lincoln, Neb.: President Bryan sent me the following appeal to be transmitted to the transmississippi governors and legislatures: </p>
<p>"At its last annual meeting the Transmississippi congress unanimously adopted a resolution endorsing the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898. We beg to call your attention to the importance of this exposition and to express the hope that every western state will make the appropriation necessary for a suitable exhibit. The entire west will be benefited by such exhibit of the resources and possibilities of the transmississippi country. Prompt action will be necessary to make the exposition a success.</p>

<head type="sub">Don't Think They Can Be Legislated Out of Office.</head>
<p>The city officials who went to Lincoln Friday to appear before the house committee to discuss the new charter came back yesterday thoroughly convinced that they might as well have remained at home.</p>
<p>The officials are not borrowing any trouble, however. They argue that the provision for ousting elected officers from their positions before their terms have expired without cause is against public policy and will so be regarded by the supreme court. They figure that if the new law is held good and the republicans win at the spring election, their opponents could call a special session of the legislature through the governor and immediately pass another charter that would legislate them out again and give the fusionists a chance to try conclusions at another election. This program could be repeated as often as required until the fusionists finally succeeded in capturing the city government. The opponents of the charter assert that the supreme court could never be induced to make a ruling that would open the way to such an abuse of legislative power.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Exposition Bill Carries in Spite of One Man's Determined Opposition.</head>
<p>SALT LAKE CITY, Utah, March 16.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The general appropriation bill passed by the Utah legislature today carries an appropriation of $8,000 for the Transmississippi Exposition. This amount will be largely increased by private subscriptions, many donations having already been promised.</p>
<p>The mine owners of the state are showing great interest in the subject and promise to make a magnificent exhibit of the mineral resources of the state.</p>
<p>This Transmississippi Exposition appropriation was party responsible for the resignation of a member of the house of representatives. The two houses were at loggerheads over this item and the appropriation for the Utah Semi-Centennial celebration, and representative Sloan, chairman of the state democratic committee, was appointed chairman of the conference committee Sloan favored striking out the Omaha appropriation entirely and giving the entire amount to the Utah show. The house twice adopted his views and twice receded at the solicitation of the senate, which was determined to make an appropriation for Omaha. When Sloan was turned down by his colleagues the second time he declared that he would no longer remain a member of the body and left the hall.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">PLEASED WITH THE CHANGE</head>
<head type="sub">NEW EXPOSITION SITE IS SATISFACTORY</head>
<head type="sub">Approval of the Action of the Directors in Locating the Big Show at the Old Fair Grounds is General</head>
<p>The announcement that the exposition site had been changed to the old fair grounds was a most gratifying piece of news to the citizens of Omaha, and it is doubtful if any move in the entire history of the exposition has caused such general satisfaction as this one. The universal opinion was one of commendation and concurrence in the change and everybody said it was "a good thing." Those who had been warmest in their <unclear reason="lines messed up">sup-mitted to be immeasurably superior to the</unclear> were equally emphatic in their expressions of approval of the action of the board in making the change. It is conceded that the ground itself is equally as desirable as the Miller park location, and one and all say that the new location will make a difference of thousands of dollars in the gate receipts alone, while the advantage of the new site for giving evening entertainments is <choice><sic>admittd</sic><corr>admitted</corr></choice> to be immeasurably superior to the more distant location.</p>
<p>A general feeling of relief is experienced that the matter has been settled and "has been settled right." People who have delayed making payments of their assessments on stock say they must "go up to the office and pay up," and a strong feeling of confidence prevails.</p>
<p>Manager Kirkendall and General Superintendent Geraldine were besieged at an early hour this morning by applicants for work. These people wanted all kinds of jobs, but by far the greater number were laborers. These latter were told to return in about ten days, as that much time would be occupied with the preliminary work and getting ready for the general plan of construction. Applicants for clerkships were told that there would be but little work of that nature in the Department of Buildings and Grounds, and that the office force would not be organized for several days.</p>
<p>Between callers, Superintendent Geraldine said that he would make a topographical survey of the grounds at once and would begin throwing dirt the moment the exact extent of the grounds is determined.</p>
<p>The only point that remains to be determined is the exact shape of the passageway connecting the northern tract with the Kountze property on the south. It is the intention to have this passageway along Twentieth street, but some of the owners of property abutting upon this street, who have conceived the idea that their particular lots are essential to the exposition scheme, have shown a disposition to "hold up" the management, and they will be given a very port of Miller park as the only suitable site within a very few days.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">NEW MEXICO WILL BE AT FRONT.</head>

<p>The news that New Mexico had made an appropriation for a state exhibit was received at exposition headquarters with a great deal of satisfaction. The appropriation, with what is assured from the several counties and large towns, will reach over $30,000 and will make New Mexico's exhibit one of the best among the states. Assurances are given that the various associations in New Mexico will unite in assisting in the movement to present the advantages of the state in the most attractive form. The vice president for the exposition in New Mexico, ex-Governor Prince, one of the strongest supporters of the exposition idea in the Trans-mississippi congress, will be at the head of the commission of eight men to be appointed by the governor to arrange for the exhibit.</p></div2>

The petition was couched in very strong language and predicted dire disaster to the enterprise if any change was made. The petition was not presented to the meeting, probably for the reason that it was very apparent early in the proceedings that the sentiment in favor of making the change was overwhelming.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">SELECTION OF OLD FAIR GROUNDS IS MADE</head>
<head type="sub">Topographical Survey of the Grounds to Be Made at Once, and Plans for Location of Buildings Prepared.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The location of the Transmississippi Exposition has been changed from Miller park to the location known as the "Old Fair Grounds site." This action was taken at the adjourned meeting of the Board of Directors held yesterday afternoon. Thirty-seven votes were cast in favor of the proposition to change, no votes being recorded against it. The new site comprises about 200 acres and the work of making the grounds will be commenced at once. Bids for lumber to be used in building a fence to enclose the entire grounds have been received and the lumber will be purchased at once. A topographical survey of the grounds will be made immediately under the direction of General Superintendent Dion Geraldine and plans for the general location of the buildings will also be made. The work will now go ahead with a snap and vigor which will atone for all of the delay and everything in connection with the work of preparation will be pushed with all due speed.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">BOUNDARIES OF THE PLAT.</head>
<p>The site now decided upon as the exposition grounds is an irregular body of land which is, practically, in three pieces. It includes the old fair grounds, a tract of about thirty-seven acres lying south and west of Ames avenue and Sherman avenue; Oak Chatham addition, lying immediately west of the fair grounds and extending to Twenty-fourth street, being bounded on the north by Ames avenue and on the south by Sprague street; these two plats constitute the north piece. The forty acres lying several hundred feet south of the fair grounds and known as "Kountze's Reserve," extending from Sherman avenue to Twenty-fourth street, forms the south piece. The long narrow piece of ground lying east of Sherman avenue along the edge of the bluff overlooking the river valley forms the east piece of ground. This latter piece contains about sixty acres and extends from the point where the belt line tracks cross Sherman avenue, just south of Ames avenue, to Locust street.</p>
<p>The old fair grounds and the Kountze tract are to be connected with a boulevard of a width yet undecided. This will include Twentieth street and more or less ground upon either side of that street, as may be later decided upon. It is proposed to connect the tract on the east side of Sherman avenue with the main ground by means of viaducts raised above the street grade in some fanciful and attractive designs.</p>

<pb n="138" xml:id="TMISB02-138"/> 
   
    <p>The following directors were present at the meeting: Carpenter, Dickinson, Evans, Hitchcock, Hussie, Jardine, Johnson, Kilpatrick, Kirkendall, Korty, Lee, Lyman, Markel, Millard Montgomery, Noyes, Payne, Reed, Rosewater, Thompson, Wattles, Webster, Weller, Wharton, Wilcox, Wilhelm, Yost, Youngs&#8212;30.</p></div3>
    <div3>
    <head type="sub">PROPOSITION FOR THE SITE.</head>
    <p>President Wattles announced that the first business would be the reading of the report of the special committee, consisting of himself and Messrs. Kirkendall and Wharton, appointed at the last meeting to investigate the conditions surrounding the obtaining of the old fair grounds site for exposition purposes.</p>
    <p>The report in full was as follows:</p>
    <p>"We, the undersigned, your committee appointed to investigate the grounds offered for site at the old fair grounds, beg leave to report as follows:</p>
    <p>"We, are offered free of all rent to the exposition the old fair grounds, comprising about thirty-seven acres.</p>
    <p>"We are offered the ground lying immediately west of the old fair grounds, comprising Oak Chatham addition to the city of Omaha, for which we can use about thirty-five acres, at an expense of $450 for removing buildings now on said grounds.</p>
    <p>We are offered about forty acres of ground lying two blocks south of the old fair grounds by Mr. Kountze, free of all rental.</p>
    <p>"We are offered by the numerous owners the free use of the ground lying east of Sixteenth street and west of the Belt line tracks, from Locust street north to the point where said tracks intersect with Sixteenth street, comprising about sixty acres, free of al expense, except we are obliged to remove two or three small houses from said land and to rent at $12 per month a cottage on said land, which can be used for exposition purposes.</p>
    <p>"We are offered the tract lying north of the old fair grounds and south of Ames avenue, comprising about fifteen acres, free of all rent.</p>
    <p>"We can obtain the use of the north half of block 4, in Kirkwood addition, at an expense of about $1,000; said expense is incurred in removing a house from one of the lots and in the purchase of this lot, which would be worth to the exposition at its close, $500 at least.</p>
    <p>"We are offered the use of three lots in the south half of block 4 free of rent. The other three lots in this block are occupied by houses which, if removed, would cost the exposition about $4,000. We do not consider it necessary, however, to have the use of these last mentioned three lots, as this ground would only be used as a connecting way between the old fair grounds and the Kountze ground.</p>
    <p>"We are offered the east half of block 9, in Plainview addition, except one lot in said block, which is occupied by a house, and which they offer to sell for $2,800.</p>
    <p>"We  do not deem it absolutely necessary to have either the south half of block 4, Kirkwood addition, or the east half of block 9, Plainview addition, provided we can secure from the city the use of Twentieth street between said blocks.</p>
    <p>"All of the above grounds are offered to the association on condition that the taxes for 1897 and 1898 be paid by the exposition association or remitted by the county and city.</p>
    <p>"In connection with the proposed change, Mr. Kountze offers to donate to the city for park purposes two blocks of ground, comprising about six acres lying east of Twentieth street and immediately south of Kirkwood addition, provided the city will accept said ground for park purposes and expend $30.00 thereon for the erection and expend $30,000 thereon for the erection of a permanent art building. Mr. Kountze also offers the two corresponding blocks west of Twentieth street to the city for the sum of $15,000, said offer to hold good for two years from this date."</p>
    <p>As the report was being read President Wattles indicated on a map posted on the wall of the room the several parcels of land referred to in the report.</p>
    <p>The reading of the report was followed by a running fire of questions from different directors. The details of the idea were quickly brought out and then Superintendent Geraldine was called upon as an exposition expert to express his opinion as to the comparative merits of Miller park and the proposed site for exposition purposes.</p></div3>
    <div3>
    <head type="sub">EXPENSE WILL BE LIGHTER</head>
    <p>In reply Mr. Geraldine said that in the light of his experience in the exposition business he regarded the fair grounds site as by far the best of the two. He stated that the buildings could be erected much cheaper on the fair grounds than on Miller park for the reason that on the latter site the "magnificent distances" would require the erection of mammoth buildings in order to make any kind of a showing, whereas on the fair grounds site the presence of ordinary buildings in the neighborhood would cause exposition buildings of moderate size to appear large in comparison. He alluded to the great difference in gate receipts on account of the fact that the site is two miles nearer the city than Miller park. Mr. Geraldine said the proposed site could be thoroughly drained both to the north and the south by means of sewers already constructed, whereas there is no sewerage constructed in Miller park. The extension of the water mains would be but slight, and whatever is done will be in the nature of permanent improvement. For landscape purposes Mr. Geraldine said there as little or no difference between the two sites. For lakes and lagoons he said plenty of water could be secured either from the water works system or from Cut-off lake.</p>
    <p>Mr. Wilcox wanted to hear what the members of the park board present had to say about accepting the park offered by Mr. Kountze and improving it.</p>
    <p>President Tukey was present and was called for. He responded by saying that there was no member of the board but would do all in his power to help along the exposition, but he said it was a question whether the board could expend its funds in the improvements of private ground. Mr. Tukey said the board had discussed the matter informally and the members were of the opinion that if the city could secure ten acres as a park they would feel that they could expend money in parking the tract and erecting a building. In reply to a question from Mr. Wilcox, Mr. Tukey said the board did not feel as though it could expend more than a few thousand dollars on a tract of five acres.</p>
    <p>Mr. Kilpatrick, another member of the park board, favored the proposed site, but opposed the erection of a permanent building so far from the center of the city and especially a building to be used as a museum. He declared that the public has a library building amply sufficient for all such purposes.</p>
    <p>Mr. Rosewater <choice><sic>combatted</sic><corr>combated</corr></choice> the position of Mr. Kilpatrick regarding the establishment of a museum. He said the opportunity offered by the exposition for establishing a museum was one which might never be offered again. He declared that the indestructible exhibits made by the several states should be collected in this building after the exposition is over and this would form the <choice><sic>nucles</sic><corr>nucleus</corr></choice> for a collection which would make Omaha famous throughout the length and breadth of the land. Mr. Rosewater said bonds should be voted at the approaching election for the purchase of twenty or thirty acres of ground in the vicinity of the old fair grounds for park purposes and a permanent, fireproof museum building should be erected on the ground. He spoke at some length of the advantages which would accrue to the city from the establishment of such a museum, and at the conclusion of his remarks was loudly applauded by the spectators and the directors.</p>
    <p>Mr. Hussie opposed making any change. He insisted that the Miller park location as the best one and said the people in the northern part of the city were opposed to a change.</p></div3>
    <div3>
    <head type="sub">PLANS MUST BE CONTRACTED.</head>
    <p>President Wattles took the floor to say that since the legislature had refused to make a liberal appropriation and the other western legislatures have largely followed Nebraska's example by doing nothing, it was certain that the exposition would have to be contracted somewhat from the broad lines on which it had been projected. He said that with the money which would be available the ground in the old fair grounds site would be all that could be used and a much better showing could be made there than in Miller park.</p>
    <p>Mr. Hitchcock vigorously denied that the appropriation of Nebraska was other than liberal, and denied that the exposition will have less money than was at first contemplated. He said that the appropriation made by Nebraska was larger than had been made b any state for an exposition within its borders except in the case of Illinois and the World's fair. He acknowledged, however, that with the money that would be available the grounds would be ample.</p>
    <p>There being no further discussion, the motion to reconsider the vote whereby Miller park was selected was then put to vote. The vote was taken viva voce and but two or three "noes" were heard. The roll was then ordered called on the question of a new location, Miller park and the old fair grounds being the only locations considered. The only voted recorded in favor of Miller park were those of Wilcox and Hussie, but on suggestion of Mr. Yost, who said there was no use in "striking his head against a stone wall," these votes were changed to make the choice unanimous. The following voices were cast by proxy: Babcock, Brown, Creighton, Kimball, Lindsey, Paxton, Dudley Smith and Wells, making thirty-seven in all.</p></div3></div2>

Patten, editor of the Salem Special, South Dakota, who met the promotive delegation when it was up there, urges through his paper that though the state has made no appropriation for the exposition, the people of the state should take the matter up and see to it that South Dakota is well represented. In this connection he publishes the resolutions passed by the legislature, as follows:</p>
<p>Whereas, There is to be held in the city of Omaha, Neb., in the summer of 1898, an exposition to be known as the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition, being distinctively an exposition of the industries of the states and territories west of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>Resolved, By the senate of the state of South Dakota, the house of representatives concurring, that we express our deep interest in and approval of the ends and purposes of said exposition, and it is the sense of this legislature that by private subscription and otherwise the people of this state should do everything in their power to secure at such exposition a creditable exhibit of all the varied interests and resources of South Dakota, and we recommend a liberal patronage of the same by our people.</p>
<p>The delegation that went to Chicago a few days ago in the interest of the exposition is expected home tomorrow morning.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">LABOR'S DEMAND GRANTED</head>
<head type="sub">The Exposition Directors Adopt a Resolution Providing for $1.50 Per Day Minimum Rate of Wages.</head>
<head type="sub">John L. Webster Presents the Resolution and Casper E. Yost Promptly Seconds It.</head>
<head type="sub">I. W. Carpenter Said that Labor Should Be Paid Just What It Could Get.</head>
<head type="sub">Another Victory for "The Western Laborer."</head>
<p>The exposition directors met last Saturday for the purpose of making a change in the site for the big show, but before reaching that order of business John L. Webster arose and read the following:</p>
<p>Resolved, That all contracts entered into by this board, its officers or agents for work pertaining to the Transmississippi and International Exposition, must stipulate therein that unskilled labor shall be paid a minimum of one dollar and fifty cents ($1.50) per day, eight hours to constitute a day's work.</p>
<p>Mr. Webster moved the adoption of the resolution. He urged the directors to adopt the same for the reason that it would be a protection to the common laborer of Omaha and those who come here from elsewhere from the meanness of unscrupulous contractors. He said that the objectionable feature of Mr. Young's resolution had been eliminated from the one he offered. He said that men who were idle all winter should not be asked nor compelled to work for less than $1.50 a day; "why, many of us spend that much every day for cigars," said Mr. Webster, as he took his seat.</p>
<p>Casper E. Yost seconded Mr. Webster's resolution.</p>
<p>Z. T. Lindsey moved to strike out eight hours and insert ten.</p>
<p>J. H. Hussie made a strong speech favoring the original motion by Mr. Webster because it was reasonable, just and timely.</p>
<p>Fred M. Youngs, labor's representative on the board, spoke in favor of the resolution introduced by Mr. Webster, as follows:</p>
<p>The adoption and enforcement by this board of a minimum wage stipulation in contracts is not only essential to the industrial interests, but to business and capitalistic interests as well. One dollar and a half a day for unskilled labor is not an abnormal advance in the present rate, all said to the contrary notwithstanding. Without such protection during the building of the exposition the wage scale of all classes of labor will be utterly demoralized. Idle men will swarm here from all directions; already the advance guards of this army is among us. Foreign contractors will also swarm in, and what will be the result with a dozen men for every job and no stipulated protection to wages? simply the same as it always has been in like cases&#8212;a scramble among contractors that may result in getting cheaper construction, but at the expense of poorly paid labor. We do not fear home contractors; most of them are fair and honest men, but it is the out-called upon to vote bonds to enlarge our county poor house. I cannot see why there should be a voice raised against this resolution. The United States government has the eight hour clause in all the government contracts and we believe will soon adopt a fair minimum wage for unskilled labor. Our present legislature saw its justice and engrafted the $1.50 clause in the state appropriation.</p>
<p>"Some time ago I introduced a similar resolution in this board, which in addition contained a clause giving home labor preference to others. The only objection raised against it was the home labor clause, which it was claimed, would make it appear to the world as an Omaha show. I do not at this time question the wisdom of the argument, but will say, since introducing that resolution, I have talked with nearly every member of this board and they were almost unanimous in saying they believed the $1.50 part of the resolution was all right, but they had voted against it on account of the home labor clause. The resolution now offered obliterates your former objections. How then can you refuse to pass this resolution which means so much to the industrial classes?</p>
<p>"True, a $1.50 minimum wage stipulation would not give all idle men work who may come here, nor would a 50c rate; but it will to a great extend tend to keep up a fair rate of wages for all classes of labor, for in a great measure all classes of labor are graded from the standard of the unskilled laborer. With such reasonable and just protection granted as we ask of you, home labor will not suffer by the great influx of labor attracted here by the exposition. I hope the resolution offered by Mr. Webster will carry."</p>
<p>Here is where I. W. Carpenter of the Carpenter Paper Co. surprised everybody by showing his teeth. He objected to the adoption of the resolution and thought it should not be introduced at all. He sprung that old chestnut about "supply and demand" controlling the price of labor; and wound up by declaring that labor should be paid "just what it could get."</p>
<p>Mr. Carpenter has been pretending that he is awfully friendly to labor and has jollied up Fred M. Youngs with some of that taffy. His speech of last Saturday laid bare his great Christian love for the dear laboring man and it explains why he sneaked out of the directors' meeting when the Youngs resolution was originally i<note>article ends abruptly</note></p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">THE NEW SITE.</head>
<head type="sub">The Exposition Location Changed to the Old Fair Grounds.</head>
<p>The directory of the exposition have exercised good judgment in changing the location of the great show to the old fair grounds and the change meets with the approval of our citizens. While parties who are interested in a monetary sense will feel disappointed yet the fact remains that the change will be beneficial and enable the directory to accomplish more with the money at their disposal then they would have been able to do at Miller park. There may be many buildings of a substantial character remaining after the show is over and these would fall to ruin in Miller park and would form not part of Omaha.</p>
<p>We should have a museum and there will be a good opportunity to secure an interesting collection for a city museum from the exhibits of the exposition. Some of the buildings erected should be of a substantial character so that they could be utilized and add to the wealth and performance of the city. There is no reason why so much money should be spent in construction without our profiting from the buildings and have a comfortable and well-appointed auditorium, for instance.</p>
<p>Another good thing in the change is that the place can be much better policed and better order be maintained than could be preserved at Miller park, which would afford a good opportunity for lawless and disreputable dens and characters.</p>
<p>With the show on the new site our business people will profit by and feel the benefit from the patronage of our visitors, while at Miller park anyone could be transported to the exposition, put up there a day or two and go to their homes without ever visiting Omaha.</p>
<p>We think the directory is entitled to some credit for their sober second thoughts, which are very often best, and this is one of the cases where it was wise to think twice. Take it for all in all, the change is one that should meet with the unanimous approval of everybody who desires to see the great show an unqualified success.</p></div2>
    
    <div2 type="article"><note>loose clip</note><p>enterprises. Knowing they underbid home competitors by taking it out of starving labor. Adopt this $1.50 resolution and you will place all contractors on a fair and equal basis. You may pay a trifle more for your buildings, but you will get better work; prevent delays, which might otherwise arise through labor troubles, and above all, you will have the satisfaction&#8212;and I believe the approval of the people&#8212;in the fact that you have prevented the degrading of American workmen to the standard of the Russian serf or the Chinese coolie, by placing them at the mercy of the contractors who would soon have them working for 60c per day.</p>
        <p>"Stop and consider, is $1.50 per day, eight hours work, $9 per week, too much for a human being with a large family to support? Do you call it an exorbitant or abnormal advance in wages? Can a man live honest and pay his debts on less?</p>
        <p>"The argument that it is better to give employment to 1,500 men at $1 per day than 1,000 men at $1.50, is not in this case applicable, for at that rate you would still have four or more men for every job. Under such reasoning you would then reduce them to 25c per day, so that all might have the privilege of working&#8212;while they starved. Our citizens would then be that he would "stay with him on anything for labor." It was even more cold-blooded and brutal than the speeches of Manderson and Granddaddy Saunders some time ago.</p>
        <p>After Carpenter had completed his "philanthropic" talk, the resolution was put to a vote and adopted with the ten hour amendment.</p>
        <p>This is another victory for labor&#8212;one of the best won in Omaha in a long time. It means a great deal for the unskilled laborer, and cannot help but benefit the skilled men.</p>
        <p>THE WESTERN LABORER is the only paper in the city that advocated and fought for the adoption of the resolution.</p>
        <p>Great credit is due Fred M. Youngs for the clever fight he made for the adoption of that resolution, and to the Central Labor union and its committee, President Bell, George Clark and Wm. Grabach, for the splendid backing given Mr. Youngs.</p></div2>

torium building having been suggested as a suitable subject for such an event. By the time the date named has arrived the fence enclosing the entire grounds will have been erected, the preliminary grading of the grounds will have been completed and the several buildings will be under way.</p>    
<p>This idea has been discussed by the executive committee in its meetings and has been practically decided upon. The matter does not properly belong to any department, as the committee is organized, and the arrangement of the affair will likely fall upon the president. President Wattles is strongly in favor of the plan and said this morning that he would push the matter. The consensus of opinion in the committee has been to the effect that the celebration should be held on a holiday in order that everybody might have an opportunity to make the event a gale day in the history of the city.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WILL BE MADE A GALA DAY.</head>
<p>Carrying out this idea the occasion will be made one in which the entire populace of Omaha, South Omaha, Council Bluffs and the surrounding country will be asked to participate. The details are crude, as yet, but a monster parade will form one of the principal features of the celebration. The military companies of this vicinity, including the regular troops at Fort Crook, will be asked to take part, the multitude of civic organizations, including the Grand Army of the Republic, which is to take such a prominent part in the exposition, the numerous secret societies, uniformed and otherwise, the various organizations of all classes and citizens generally will be invited to manifest their appreciation of the great importance of the occasion to this part of the country by taking an active part in the parade. The several labor organizations will be asked to turn out in a grand body in honor of the event, the musical organizations in the vicinity will be asked to join in the jubilee and everything points to a gigantic turnout.</p>
<p>The people generally will be asked to join in making the demonstration general by decorating their business houses and dwellings, and every effort will be used to give the city a holiday appearance.</p>
<p>The line of march of the parade will terminate at a point inside the exposition grounds, and here a suitable grandstand will be erected and preparations made for an imposing ceremony in keeping with the great magnitude of the event. Speeches will be delivered by prominent people, to be determined upon. In this connection Governor Holcomb has signified his warm approval of the exposition and his willingness to appear on such an occasion, and he will probably be one of the speakers. Other prominent speakers will be present and the ceremonies in connection with the laying of the cornerstone will be made impressive.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">SURVEYING THE GROUNDS.</head>
<p>Long before this, however, the work of making the exposition will be well under way. The active work commenced this morning, when a surveying party of five men commenced the work of making a topographical survey of the grounds. This party is at present under the charge of Mr. Ralls of Council Bluffs, a surveyor who is well known in Omaha, having been connected with engineering matters in this city. "Doc" Smith is to be placed in charge of the party as soon as Superintendent Geraldine can get in communication with him. Mr. Smith was notified to report for duty this morning, but failed to do so, and a messenger made several ineffectual attempts to find him.</p>
    <p>Mr. Geraldine is busily engaged at nights in figuring up a number of bids which have been sent to him for supplying lumber for the fence which is to enclose the grounds. His time during the day is taken up in receiving callers, there being a constant stream of people looking for work. All of these were told that the work of erecting the fence would be commenced as soon as the frost is out of the ground and the material is delivered. About ten days will be required to secure the large amount of material which will be required for fencing and it will be nearly as long, in all probability, before the ground is entirely free from frost. By that time the preliminary survey will have been completed and the work of making the general plan of the buildings will be commenced. The design of the several buildings will be the next step and when this is completed the excavating and other work will be begun. The next step will be to invite competitive bids on the buildings and after the contracts are let the work will commence in earnest. From the point the work will be pushed with a speed which will satisfy the most ardent. The exposition grounds will present a scene of activity unparalleled in the history of the city and the fable of <choice><sic>Alladin</sic><corr>Aladdin</corr></choice> and his wonderful lamp will be outrivaled by plain facts.</p></div3></div2>

    <head type="sub">EXPOSITION ENVELOPE RETURNS.</head>
<head type="sub">It Brought Letters Which Confused the Employes.</head>
<p>The officers in the exposition headquarters received some valuable mail yesterday, which did not belong to them and which is apt to result in the removal of a Nasby at a point in Arkansas. The postmaster here was telephoned yesterday that the exposition officers had some registered packages which they could not explain, and Deputy Woodard went up to investigate. They were two registered letters, one addressed to Atlanta, Ga., and the other to Little Rock, Ark., with several other letters of less importance. The letters had been turned out of a sack with a lot of other mail received for the exposition managers and part of it had been opened without discovering that it did not belong to any one in Nebraska.</p>
<p>The exposition uses a large manilla envelope in which printed matter is enclosed to send out over the country. On the face of this envelope is an advertisement in large letters of the exposition. One of these letters had evidently fallen into the hands of the postmaster at a small station in Arkansas. Mr. Woodard said it was possible that when the postmaster made up his mail and prepared to put the registered packages in the envelope provided by the government, he took up this exposition envelope from which the contents had been removed and put the letters in that without noticing what it was. The written address inscribed on the envelope at the exposition headquarters had been scratched out.</p>
<p>The postmaster had doubtless put the letters in this envelope, sealed it and laid it aside. Later it had been gathered up with some other mail, and sent away. As the envelope had no address but the advertisement of the exposition, it was returned to the offices here and on the face of it was religiously stamped the information that 7 cents in postage was yet due.</p>
<p>Mr. Woodard said this was one instance where the registered mail, if it had not been reported by the parties receiving it erroneously, would have been lost completely, for there was no record of it anywhere except in the office where the letters were registered, and no clue to indicate in what direction or to whom it went. Mr. Woodard also said that the erring postmaster was probably suffering all kinds of tortures of the spirit trying to discover what became of the letters.</p>

<head type="sub">Government Measure Taken Up and Rushed Through.</head>
<p>The sundry civil bill was re-enacted by the house of representatives yesterday, and it now goes to the senate. The bill carries $200,000 for the exposition, $175,000 for the Omaha new postoffice building and $75,000 for the South Omaha new postoffice. This is the bill that President Cleveland allowed to die in the last hours of his terms. If the senate will now show the same speed in disposing of the bill which has characterized the action of the house, the exposition will not be delayed as long by the adverse action of Mr. Cleveland as was at first feared by the friends of the enterprise.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Manager Kirkendall Submits a Statement of Probable Expense of His Department.</head>
<head type="sub">IDEA OF THE EXTENT OF THE EXPOSITION</head>
<head type="sub">Million and a Quarter Dollars Required to Prepare Grounds and to Erect the Necessary Exposition Buildings.</head>
<p>At the meeting of the executive committee of the Transmississippi Exposition yesterday afternoon Manager Kirkendall, chief of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, submitted an estimate of the probable cost of preparing the grounds and buildings, which had been prepared by himself and General Superintendent Geraldine, and asked for the advice and opinions of the other members of the committee. For the first time the committee had before it the consideration of the details of construction and the session was an animated one, lasting all the afternoon, and an adjournment was taken in order to give this most important matter still further consideration.</p>
<p>The estimate presented by Mr. Kirkendall was explained by that gentleman as being a rough approximation designed to acquaint the members of the committee with the probable cost of an exposition constructed along the liens which have been laid down. He said the list in question did not include the buildings to be erected by the federal government or the state of Nebraska, but was only designed to include the buildings to be erected by the exposition association. The estimate was as follows:</p>

<p>Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity reported that the newspapers of Germany are taking up the exposition, and have given the matter considerable space in their columns, commenting most favorably on the project.</p>
<p>Manager Hitchcock of the Department of Promotion reported that he was working on a plan for the mobilization of the militia of the several states in the union and had opened correspondence with the adjutants general of all the states with a view of securing their co-operation. He said he had received replies from a few of these officers, and they expressed their hearty approval of the scheme. The committee endorsed the idea, and thought it should be pushed.</p>
<p>A committee from Typographical union, No. 190, appeared before the committee to protest against sending any work to non-union shops. The committee was given a hearing and the matter was taken under advisement.</p>
<p>Superintendent Geraldine of the Department of Buildings and Grounds says the fence to be constructed around the Exposition grounds will be erected by days' work by the Exposition company. The construction of the buildings and all work of grading which can be separated from the technical work of the landscape architect will be let by contract to the lowest and best bidder. Mr. Geraldine says that on this account there will be very little work for laborers and mechanics, except under the contractors who secure the different classes of work. He wishes this announcement made for the benefit of the floods of workingmen of all classes who are continually pouring in upon him from all directions. Many come from the small towns surrounding Omaha, and a great many have drifted in here from all sections of the country, drawn thither by the hope of finding work on the exposition.</p>
<p>Mr. Geraldine says at least sixty days will be required to make plans for the different buildings and until that is done and the contracts let, there will be no work for the men employed by building contractors.</p></div3></div2>

    <head type="main">GERMANS AT THE EXPOSITION</head>
<head type="sub">PERFECTING PLANS FOR THEIR VISIT</head>
<head type="sub">Propose to Hold the Big Turnfest in Omaha During the Exposition Year, Thus Bringing Thousands of People Here.</head>
<p>The Germans of the city are determined that their nationality and nation shall be well represented at the Transmississippi Exposition. The Bee has already published in full the plans of a big exhibit which they propose. These are at present in statu quo. Just at present the Germans are engaged in pushing the scheme which will result in a big turnfest some time during the exposition year. The first steps toward the consummation of the latter plan will occur on April 4 in St. Joseph, when a joint meeting of representatives of the Nebraska and the Missouri Valley turnbezirks will be held for the purpose of consolidating the two associations. The Bee has also given full publicity to this scheme. The members of both associations have expressed themselves in favor of the plan and it will take place upon the date mentioned. The consolidation will be a permanent one. This will result to the advantage of both turnbezirks, because the annual turnfests will become more considerable affairs than under the present arrangement under which the bodies hold separate meetings.</p>
<p>Philip Andres, who will be the Nebraska representative to the joint meeting, has been instructed to work upon a still further extension of the plan. This proposes to take in all the turning societies in the section between the Mississippi river and the Rocky mountains. It is not believed that the bodies west of the latter boundary can be induced to come in, although an effort will be made to get them. The first steps in this direction will be taken immediately after Andres' return from the St. Joseph meeting. He proposes to first visit the societies in Iowa and Minnesota. As soon as these are canvassed his campaign will extend into the Dakotas and Colorado. The other western states will then be visited. it is believed that all will be obtained with a little persuasion.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as it will require some money to carry out this program, an appeal will be made to the exposition directory to assist the Omaha turnverein, which has worked up the scheme. Representatives of the body will visit the Bureau of Promotion today with the purpose of bringing the matter to its attention. It is said that this expense will be perfectly legitimate, since such a turnfest as is proposed will tend to bring multitudes of Germans to the big show. Contestants from every one of the western societies, it is said, are certain to take part. Moreover, the date of the meeting will be so fixed that some of the participants in the big national turnfest will be obtained. The meeting will then be of almost as much importance as the latter.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">Doesn't Like the Tabernacle.</head>
<p>WAHOO, March 26.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: In a late issue of your paper I saw a suggestion that the Transmississippi Exposition auditorium should be modeled after the Mormon tabernacle. As I have lived in Salt Lake City two years and attended services held in the tabernacle, I deem it my duty to warn the directors of the exhibition not to use that model, for they will have on their hands a complete acoustic failure.</p>
<p>The tabernacle is a union of two whispering galleries with pews at each end, these being over 200 feet apart. The upper pulpit, the president's, is in one pew; the lower part of the gallery at the opposite end contains the other pews. The dropping of a pin is heard very distinctly, but in the middle of the building it is impossible to hear a word of any speaker. I have tried it repeatedly. The aisles are other parts of the tabernacle are nearly as bad. The Gentile seats, close to the speaker's, are the best; next to them pews at the end of the gallery. The Mormons were compelled to fill the immense area with <choice><sic>guirlands</sic><corr>garlands</corr></choice> of spruce and fir branches in order to check the rolling echoes enough so that the building would not be entirely useless.</p>
<p>An architect somewhat acquainted with the laws of acoustics will at a glance of the structure know that this necessarily must be so.</p>

<head type="sub">Exposition Committee Cordially Greeted by the Legislature.</head>
<p>CHICAGO, March 26.&#8212;The Transmississippi Exposition delegation returned from Springfield this morning highly pleased with the reception accorded by Governor Tanner and the Illinois legislature and the promising outlook for an appropriation of from $40,000 to $60,000. The earnest appear made in behalf of this exposition by President Higinbotham of the Columbian World's fair, who accompanied the delegation from Chicago, doubtless contributed much toward the favorable impression created. The joint committee on appropriations gave a full hearing to the delegation and was addressed by Messrs. Higinbotham, Rosewater, Poppleton and Wells. The delegation also had a conference with Speaker Curtis, who expressed himself as very friendly to the exposition. Early action is anticipated.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><dateline>THE EVENING BEE: <lb/> WEDNESDAY, MARCH 24,</dateline>
    <head type="main">STIRRING UP ENTHUSIASM</head>
<head type="sub">INTEREST IN THE EXPOSITION INCREASES</head>
<head type="sub">Values of Vacant Property in the Vicinity of the Show Grounds Have a Strong Upward Tendency.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The recent decided developments in exposition matters have had the effect of stirring up a great deal of enthusiasm which had become rather latent, and a much stronger feeling of confidence has been manifested during the past week or two than has been shown at any previous time. One very side are heard expressions of the strongest approval of the action of the Board of Directors in changing the site, and the only criticisms heard are to the effect that it was unfortunate that the fair grounds site was not selected in the first place. The effect of this change has been to cause subscribers to pay their assessments on stock, and the money has been coming in at a lively rate.</p>
<p>The effect upon the exposition itself, however, is not the only result which has followed the encouraging developments of the past few days. The positive indications that the active work upon the exposition was to be pushed with all possible speed has had the effect of causing property values in the neighborhood of the exposition grounds to show a sudden upward tendency. All vacancy property in that neighborhood has suddenly acquired a value which was not dreamed of a month ago, and the market in options has gone up like a balloon, with no indications of coming down. Every hour in the day sees a large number of people examining the property in that vicinity with a view of establishing stores of various kinds. The people want to either buy or lease, and those fortunate enough to own land in that part of the city are being eagerly sought.</p>
<p>The work of making a topographical survey of the ground is proceeding rapidly. As the work progresses maps are made of the grounds in order that there may be no delay in determining upon the grading, etc., necessary to be done.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WILL BE A WHITE CITY.</head>
<p>The exposition will be a "white city." This has been decided upon, mainly for the reason that it will be impracticable to give it any other color. It is conceded that the material to be used in covering the large buildings, such as the Agricultural building, the Machinery and Electricity buildings, the Manufactures and Liberal Arts building, etc., shall be the stucco material known as staff, being the material which was used so extensively in the World's fair. These buildings will all be of a temporary character, designed to be removed after the exposition closes.</p>
<p>It was demonstrated at Chicago that staff is the most effective, as well as the most economical, material which can be used for such purposes. The World's fair management, after spending thousands of dollars in experimenting, demonstrated that it was impossible to give the staff a tint. The natural color of the material was a dazzling white and all efforts to give it a creamy tint or an "old ivory" tint, or any other tint, were failures. The Transmississippi management will profit by the experience of the Chicago people and will not lose any time or money experimenting. It was suggested by Mr. Rosewater, while this subject was under discussion by the executive committee, that there is a large bed of natural cement almost equal to the imported article, which is to be had in the northern part of this state for the hauling, and the idea of using this material for making stucco, which would give a natural stone effect, was discussed, but it was concluded that there was no time for experiments and the matter was allowed to drop.</p>
<p>There will be several gateways to the exposition grounds, and it has been suggested by Manager Rosewater that the parties interested in the development of the various kinds of building stone in the western states be asked to construct towering archways of attractive deigns at these gateways, thereby displaying the artistic qualities of the stone and its adaptability for such work, as well as embellishing the exposition grounds. This suggestions met with favor with the executive committee, and some of the stone men in this city have signified their desire to take <unclear reason="covered"></unclear> opportunity.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">REGARDING <unclear reason="covered"></unclear></head>
<p>The track of the <unclear reason="covered"></unclear> off about twenty acres of the north end of the exposition grounds, and it is proposed to move the tracks temporarily from their present position, up to Amos avenue. If this is agreed to by the Missouri Pacific company it will allow the exposition management to include within its grounds the grove of large trees in the northwest corner of Oak Chatham addition, near the intersection of Ames avenue and Twenty-fourth street.</p>
<p>It has been decided that in the construction of the large main buildings of the exposition, the construction of galleries shall be tabooed.  It is said that the experience of other expositions where galleries were used in the large buildings has been that the exhibitors who were assigned space in the galleries were greatly disappointed because the people would not visit these exhibits and the dust dropping upon the exhibits below has been very annoying. It was therefore decided that no galleries would be placed in the buildings.</p>
<p>A suggestion which has met with great favor with the executive committee is one which contemplates the placing of the fisheries exhibit under ground. It is proposed that the huge tanks in which will be imprisoned the monsters of the deep and the beauties oft he mountains brooks shall be placed beneath the surface of the ground in a subterranean structure lighted by electricity and properly embellished to make it a cool retreat from the heat of the day. This idea is taken from the great Paris exposition where a department constructed along these same lines formed one of the most attractive and popular exhibits. It is the purpose to have in this exhibit the rare and curious monsters which inhabit the unseen recesses of the great oceans, as well as the more common members of the piscatorial family. It is the opinion of the management that an underground exhibit of this nature would form a most attractive features of the exposition.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">PROMISES AID FOR EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">Interest in Two Bills Now Before the Legislature.</head>
<p>The exposition management is greatly interested in two bills now pending in the Nebraska legislature, both of which have an important bearing on the exposition. One of these bills affects Douglas county alone, and the other applies to every county in the state. The first provides that in counties having a population of over 125,000 the county commissioners shall, upon petition of 1,000 voters of the county, submit a proposition to the voters to vote bonds in the sum of $200,000 in aid of the exposition. The other bill provides that the county boards of agriculture, under certain conditions, may make county exhibits at the exposition. The exposition management regards these bills as being of more importance than the state appropriation.</p>
<p>The people of Douglas county are interested in seeing the one which applies to this county enacted into a law. An appropriation of this amount by this county would go a long way toward pushing the subscription list up to the $1,000,000 mark. It is said that, if indications count for anything, the prospect for the passage of the bill is good, and the sentiment in this county appears to be strong enough to insure the adoption of a bond proposition by the voters of the county.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">PROMOTERS GO TO ILLINOIS.</head>
<head>Will Appear Before the Legislature Next Thursday.</head>
<p>A party of exposition promoters will leave for Chicago tonight over the Milwaukee road to meet the officials of the World's fair at the union League club at noon tomorrow. The party comprises E. Rosewater, W. S. Poppleton, D. Farnell, jr., C. W. Lyman of Omaha and Lucius Wells of Council Bluffs.</p>
<p>This party will be entertained at the Union League club by H. N. Higinbotham, the president of the World's fair. A number of the officials of the great Columbian exposition will be present, as well as prominent citizens of Chicago, among whom will be William Penn Nixon, Colonel R. C. Clowdry and Ferdinand W. Peck. Exposition ideas will form a subject of discussion and the Chicagoans will be informed fully regarding the Transmississippi Exposition. The party will proceed to Springfield Wednesday night and will probably be accompanied by a delegation of prominent Chicago people. Thursday the visitors will appear before the committees of ways and means of both houses of the legislature in the interest of the bill that is now pending in the Illinois legislature, providing for the expenditure of $100,000 for the purpose of making an exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition, to be held in this city in 1898.</p></div2>
    
    <div2 type="article">
<p>With active operations really begun at the exposition grounds, work actually started on a news passenger station, the soil in an unprecedentedly favorable condition for spring planting,and Dave Mercer still in congress, no further doubt should exist that the sun of prosperity is rising upon Omaha and Nebraska.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">"Experts" for the Exposition.</head>
<p>OMAHA, March 20.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: There has been some anxiety expressed in western counties of the state least Omaha citizens should reap some advantages from the coming exposition. This fear appears to have no real foundation. Present indications are that offices carrying a salary will be largely filled by eastern talent. Of course, it is not to be considered probable that any western man has sufficient brains or executive abilities to make a success of the fair. Whether the people who contribute the funds should have employment or not is a matter of sentiment. Possibly some Omaha man can shoveled dirt as good as a Chicago man who shoveled at the World's fair, but there is nothing sure about this, and it is best not to take any chances. I would suggest that the directors having this in charge should insert an advertisement in a Chicago paper for all men that worked on the World's fair, and ask them to bring certificates to that effect (this of course includes all shovelers). "Protest home industry" and "Stand up for Nebraska" sound well as new songs, but, like all songs, soon get old. Most likely the importing element of the exposition board will expect us to continue to support them in their private and business affairs? To be sure, that's another matter.</p>

They were chaperoned by President H. N. Higginbotham of the World's fair, who is much interested in the Omaha exhibition.</p>
<p>As the state treasury is in a much depleted condition at present an appropriation of $100,000 was naturally a delicate topic of conversation, but the delegation argued that not more than half that amount will be actually expended&#8212;the balance to be refunded to the state&#8212;and as the money is not needed before July 1, 1898, there will be sufficient time to remedy the present stringency in the state's finances.</p>
<p>"This is my first visit to Springfield," said Mrs. Higginbotham, "but I deemed the necessity for Illinois to participate in the Omaha exposition of sufficient importance to warrant my appearance here in favor of a bill pending before the legislatures. Nebraska rendered valuable assistance in making the Columbian exposition a success and it is only right that Illinois should reciprocate the favor. From the talk I have had with senators and representatives the chances for passing the bill seem very good indeed.

It is expected that this material will be delivered within the next ten days and the work of erecting the fence will be commenced at that time. A large amount of material is required for this fence and the order was distributed among the largest dealer in lumber in the city. The Chicago Lumber company received an order for 2,600 white cedar posts and 75,000 feet of fencing; the H. F. Cady Lumber company will furnish 64,737 feet of fencing, and the Wyatt-Bullard Lumber company will furnish 30,000 feet. The average price of the fencing is $11 per thousand feet, the total price of the lumber being $2,747.58. The fence will be about eight feet in height and will be of the "tight board" variety. By the time the material is delivered the frost in the ground will have vanished and the work will process rapidly.</p>
<p>The committee held a consultation with Architect Charles Howard Walker of Boston regarding the general plan of the grounds and the arrangement of the main buildings. Mr. Walker was very favorably impressed with the site chosen for the exposition. He said the site was exceptionally well suited for exposition purposes and would lend itself to the purpose with the minimum of cost. He said he had casually inspected the grounds and had formulated an outline of a plan which he would transfer to paper, and would be prepared to show the committee a rough sketch of the general arrangement by Wednesday of this week.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WILL PUSH FOR A MILLION.</head>
<p>It was decided that an active canvass shall be commenced at once and prosecuted with all possible vigor in the endeavor to increase the stock subscription list to the $1,000,000 mark.</p>
<p>The bill making an appropriation of $100,000 for a state exhibit will become a law on August 1, provided the legislature adjourns during April, which seems probable. This appropriation is only available when the sum of $200,000 shall have been paid in, in cash, on stock subscriptions. In order that it may not be necessary to levy heavy assessments on the people who have already subscribed it has been decided to increase the subscription list and increase the amount of the receipts in this way, instead of by means of an assessment of 30 per cent. Committees acting under the direction of the Department of Ways and Means will be sent out within a few days and a thorough canvass will be made of this entire section, as well as of the surrounding country.</p>
<p>The projected celebration of the inauguration of exposition work, announced in The Bee last week, was ratified by the committee, and President Wattles was authorized to appoint four stockholders of the association to assist him in arranging a program and issuing invitations to the various societies and noted people to participate. Arbor day, April 22, was fixed as the date of the inauguration ceremonies, principally because that day is a legal holiday and also for the reason that the exercises will be largely in the line of a celebration of a tree planting and other artistic decorating. The committee to be appointed by the president will report to the executive committee at its next meeting.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">ILLINOIS WILL BE REPRESENTED.</head>
<p>Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity, who headed a party of stockholders who went to Chicago and Springfield, Ill., last week in the interest of the exposition, reported upon the work accomplished by the delegation. This report was along the same lines as the accounts of the doings of the party, which were published in the telegraph columns of The Bee during the latter part of last week. It informed the committee that the exposition project met with cordial support in Chicago and at Springfield and the belief was expressed that the Illinois legislature would pass a bill appropriation at least $50,000, the chairmen of the finance committees of both branches of the legislature having agreed to recommend a bill carrying that amount. It was also stated that the World's fair board gave the matter its warm support and assurances were given that the Windy City will be well represented at the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
<p>Manager Hitchcock of the Department of Promotion reported that he had taken up the suggestion for the mobilization of the entire militia forces of the United States, which was set out at some length in an article which appeared in The Bee about three weeks ago, and has been in correspondence with the adjutants general of every state in the union. He said replies had been received from a number of these officers and they were almost a unit in favoring the scheme. Mr. Hitchcock also reported that correspondence had been opened up with the officers of the national guard in the several states and that the matter would be vigorously pushed. The other members of the committee expressed themselves as being strongly in favor of pushing the plans for this great demonstration. It was conceded to be a most important matter and one well worthy of extraordinary efforts to bring about.</p>
<p>The salary of Secretary Wakefield was fixed by the committee. This matter had been allowed to run along from one meeting to another and had never been taken up for consideration. It was greed that the salary of the secretary should be fixed at $2,500 per annum, to date from the time of the organization of the new Board of Directors.</p></div3></div2>

<p>Charles H.

He arrived Thursday morning, but his arrival has not been made known, an air of secrecy surrounding the matter which is mystifying to the members of the committee.</p>
<p>Since his arrival in the city Mr. Walker has been actively engaged in viewing the exposition grounds and incubating plans for the general arrangement of the buildings, the style of architecture, etc.</p></div2>

<p>It is recorded by Dr. Nansen's biographers Brogger and Rolfsen, that his first meeting with his future wife was in the woods about Frogner Seator, where one day, observing the soles of two feet sticking up out of the snow he approached them, with natural curiosity in time to see the head of Eva Sars emerge from a snow bank. Dr. Nansen was married in 1880, after his return from his successful expedition across Greenland. Where he started in the Fram, in 1893, his wife left at home at lysaker, near Christiania with one child, turned for occupation to the development and use of her gifts as a singer and with notable success. King Oscar of Sweden is one of her admirers, and especially likes her singing, which he has often heard and since she has been in England the compliment has been paid her of asking her to sing before the queen. She is a stance backer of her adventurous husband, whose departure on his perilous errand cost her anxieties and misgivings as to which she said little at the time. Since her husband's return she has sometimes spoken in conversation of her fears, and has said that careful comparison of Dr. Nansen's diary with her record or remembrance of her own sensations bears her out in the belief that the times when she was the most concerned about him were the seasons of his greatest peril. That implies a telegraphic communication born of intense sympathy and solicitude, the possibility of which science seems no longer disposed to deny.</p>
<p>It was announced the other day that the souvenirs for a semi-public dinner in New York were designed by a firm of silversmiths and they cost $15 apiece. The menu cards of a dinner that was given a year ago to a well-known politician were bound in silver and cost $30 apiece.</p>

<head type="sub">LANDSCAPE ARTIST ULRICH ARRIVES</head>
<head type="sub">Architects Now Busily Engaged in Working Up an Idea for the Grouping of the Main Buildings.</head>
    <div3>
<p>Rudolph Ulrich, the New York landscape artist who was appointed by Manager Kirkendall to design the landscape features of the exposition grounds and superintend the work of placing the grounds in condition, arrive din the city this morning.</p>
<p>Mr. Ulrich was met in Chicago by Superintendent of Construction Geraldine, and both arrive din the city at an early hour today. After breakfast Mr. Geraldine drove Mr. Ulrich to the exposition grounds. The land to be used for the exposition was viewed as thoroughly as could be done without making an actual survey. They then returned to the city and Mr. Ulrich locked himself in his room, where he has since been at work on preliminary plans for the arrangement of the grounds. Mr. Geraldine announced that no one could see Mr. Ulrich until he had completed his preliminary plans, in order that his ideas as to the arrangement of the grounds might not be warped or biased by suggestions made by others.</p>
<p>Mr. Ulrich said he would be occupied about three days in making his plans and would then be ready to appear before the executive committee and explain his ideas in detail.</p>
<p>Walker &amp; Kimball, who are making the preliminary plans for the grouping of the main buildings of the exposition and the general style of architecture to be used in the several buildings, are busily engaged in this work and say the will be ready to present to the executive committee, at its meeting tomorrow night, a comprehensive plan showing the general plan of the grounds and the other matters in connection with this portion of work.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">ARRANGE FOR A CELEBRATION.</head>
<p>President Wattles has appointed the committee authorized at the last meeting of the executive committee to arrange for a grand celebration to be held on Arbor day in commemoration of the inauguration of the exposition. This committee comprises the following stockholders of the exposition association: President Wattles, R. S. Wilcox, A. Hospe, jr., E. P. Peck and Frank Colpetzer. The committee will meet at the office of the president at exposition headquarters in the Paxton block at 8 o'clock tonight to arrange a plan for the celebration.</p>
<p>Applications for space in the Plaisance of the exposition continue to be received with every mail and there is every indication that this portion of the great show will fairly teem with attractive exhibits. Among the applications received this morning is one of more than ordinary merit. It is a device for giving visitors a trip by boat through some of the most beautiful scenic spots in the world. The prospectus filed with the application sets forth that the concessionaire proposes to construct a canal about one-half mile in length. Along the sides of this will be placed an artistic painting depicting the beauties of the canyons of the famous Yosemite valley. The foreground will be fitted to the picture in the well known style of the cyclorama and the canal will wind through this beautiful scenery bearing upon its placid bosom the drifting boats carrying the tourists. From the Yosemite valley the trip will lead the visitors to the Hawaiian islands, and the beautiful scenery of these islands will be shown in the same manner. This concession will require 40,000 square feet.</p>
<p>Another applicant proposes to construct a "scenic railway" 1,000 feet in length. The applicant does not transmit any prospectus of his design but simply applies for 30,000 square feet of space.</p>
<p>A "Moorish Palace and Mirror Maze," occupying 10,000 square feet, is another concession for which space is asked.</p>
<p>Aside from these and the other applications which have already been mentioned in detail, there are a large number of applications for concessionaires of a less attractive nature.</p></div3></div2>

<head type="sub">ARRANGEMENTS OF EXPOSITION GROUNDS</head>
<head type="sub">Landscape Plans and Details of the Style of Architecture of Buildings to Be Submitted to Executive Committee Tonight.</head>
<p>The executive committee of the Transmississippi Exposition will meet tonight for the purpose of hearing the report of Architects Walker and Kimball and Landscape Architect Rudolf Ulrich on plans for the arrangement of the exposition grounds and the style and architecture of the buildings.</p>
<p>Since his arrival in the city yesterday morning Mr. Ulrich has been in consultation with Messrs. Walker and Kimball in order that the landscape features of the plan may be made to harmonize with the arrangement and architecture of the buildings. Mr. Ulrich expresses himself as being strongly in favor of using home products so far as possible in beautifying the exposition grounds, and with that end in view he will recommend the use of indigenous trees almost entirely. He says that with the exception of a few evergreens and other special varieties, the trees growing in this vicinity can be used entirely in improving the grounds. He also advocates the free use of water as a cheap means of beautifying the exposition grounds.</p>
<p>Mr. Ulrich is a German by birth, being a native of Weimar, and is 57 years of age. He was educated at Potsdam, near Berlin, and graduated with high honors in natural science, landscape art and horticulture, having early shown decided talent for landscape art and gardening. He also graduated from the Poncological institute of Gendbrugge, Belgium. His work in landscape gardening in Europe attracted the attention of Henry Probasco of Cincinnati, who induced Mr. Ulrich to come to America to take charge of Mr. Probasco's private grounds. He has since remained in this country, doing extensive work in all parts of the country, which has made his name one of the most celebrated among landscape artists in the world. The beautiful grounds of Menlo park, the property of ht elate ex-Governor Stanford of California, and the private grounds of other wealthy Californians which are noted for their beauty and artistic effect are his work, and he has also been in charge of the work of beautifying many of the public grounds of California and other states.</p>
<p>During the World's fair Mr. Ulrich was superintendent of the landscape department of the exposition and signed many of the most attractive landscape features. He also had charge of the roadways and miscellaneous departments of the exposition and was highly complimented by the management for his practical administration of the affairs of these departments in addition to his skill as an artist.</p>
<p>Since the close of the World's fair Mr. Ulrich was in charge of the public parks of Brooklyn for two years, but declined reappointment on account of the press of private business.</p>
<p>Mr. Ulrich is credited with being a hard worker and a sever taskmaster. Persons who knew him at the World's fair say he frequently worked seventy-two hours at a stretch and exhausted all of his assistants.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">EXPOSITION CELEBRATION PLANS.</head>
<head type="sub">Officers Fix Upon Arbor Day as the Date.</head>
<p>President Wattles has appointed the committee authorized at the last meeting of the executive committee to arrange for a grand celebration to be held on Arbor day in commemoration of the inauguration of the exposition. This committee comprises the following stockholders of the exposition associations President Wattles, R. S. Wilcox, A. Hospe, jr., E. P. Peck and Frank Colpetzer.</p>
<p>The committee to prepare for the inaugural parade for the exposition on April 22, met last night in the office of President Wattles, in the Paxton block. After discussing the project in all its details, the work in connection with the celebration was divided among the members of the committee as follows: A. Hospe, jr., and R. S. Wilcox will have charge of all matters in connection with the parade; Frank Colpetzer will have charge of the stand and the seating of the speakers and distinguished guests; and Mr. Wattles and A. C. Smith will look after the speakers. It was practically decided that, as the celebration occurs on Arbor day, to make a distinctive feature of the event the planting of an "Exposition tree," and an effort will be made to have Hon. J. Sterling Morton, the father of the day, to officiate in the planting. Mr. Morton will also be invited to be one of the speakers, with Governor Holcomb, W. J. Bryan, and Governor Drake of Iowa.</p>
<p>It was decided that the celebration should take the form of a parade, to form at 1:30 p. m. sharp, march through the principal streets to the grounds, where the speaking will take place.</p>
<p>The committee will meet again tomorrow noon to compare notes on the work done and make further plans.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">CONSIDERING THE PLANS</head>
<head type="sub">ARCHITECTS SUBMIT THEIR DRAWINGS</head>
<head type="sub">Exposition City is Elaborated on Paper and Makes a Pleasing Showing&#8212;Further Consideration Will Be Had Today.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The arrangement of the main buildings of the Transmississippi Exposition and the general plan of the grounds formed the subject of discussion at a special meeting of the executive committee held at exposition headquarters in the Paxton block last night.</p>
<p>President Wattles, Chairman Lindsey and Messrs. Rosewater, Bruce and Hitchcock of the executive committee, together with Architects Walker and Kimball, Landscape Architect Ulrich and Superintendent of Construction Dion Geraldine, were present. Messrs. Walker and Kimball submitted the general plans they had prepared, showing the grouping of the main buildings and the arrangement of the exposition grounds. These plans were discussed at great length by all present, and it was finally decided that the whole party would meet on the grounds at 3 o'clock this afternoon and consider the arrangement of the grounds fully before passing upon the plans.</p>
<p>The plan suggested by Messrs. Walker and Kimball contemplates massing the main portion of the exposition on the portion of the grounds known as the "Kountze tract," being that portion bounded on the south by Pinkney street and on the north by Pratt street, and extending from Sixteenth to Twenty-fourth street. On this tract they propose to locate the main buildings, grouping them about a lake extending through the center of the tract.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">TRANSMISSISSIPPI ARCH.</head>
<p>The main entrance to the exposition is placed by them at Twentieth street on the south line of the grounds. This entrance is intended to be an imposing piece of architecture, being in the form of a triumphal arch. A preliminary sketch showed and arch extending entirely across Twentieth street, to be designated as "The Transmississippi Arch." This will be ninety feet in height to the extreme top, and seventy-five feet to the cornice. The striking features of this entrance will be the decoration of the frieze and from this the arch takes its name. This frieze will be finished in Moorish design, with numerous small arches, in each of which will be placed the official seal of one of the transmississippi states or territories, this portion of the work being done in colors giving the whole a most striking appearance. Above the cornice is a large seal of the United States, the seal and the arch being surmounted by the eagle grasping the arrows and olive branch.</p>
<p>Passing beneath this artistic and imposing entrance, the visitor will find himself confronted by a most impressive arrangement of architectural effect calculated to make upon the mind, at the outset, a most favorable impression. Immediately in front of him, and stretching away on either hand, will be an expanse of sparkling water reflecting from its crystal surface the beautiful forms of the magnificent buildings grouped along its banks. Across the water the eyes of the visitor will rest upon the Administration building, constructed in the form of a towering archway with pleasing architectural effects combined with utility as an office building. The entrance arch and the administration arch span the main boulevard leading to the section of the grounds lying to the north.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">LOCATION OF BUILDINGS.</head>
<p>Stretching away to the left of the visitor, who stands facing to the north, will be seen, on the south bank of the lake, the auditorium with the Federal Government building standing in stately magnificence at the extreme western end of the grounds, facing the east. At the east of the entrance arch, on the south side of the lake, will be seen the Art building and the Manufacturers building. On the north side of the lake the Agricultural building will be at the west side of the administration arch, while the Mines and Mining building and the Electricity building will be at the east of the center.</p>
<p>Occupying the center of this tract of ground will be a series of small lakes, varying in width from 150 to 450 feet, spanned at convenient intervals by ornamental bridges.</p>

<pb n="148" xml:id="TMISB02-148"/>

<p>The main buildings in this portion of the grounds will be connected by covered passageways, constructed in ornamental designs, and intended to afford protection from the rays of the sun during the summer months. The buildings themselves will be from 400 to 600 feet in length and from 150 to 250 feet in width.</p>
<p>At the eastern end of this portion of the grounds the visitor will find a grand staircase forming a magnificent architectural finish to the ensemble of the picture and giving entrance to a handsome viaduct spanning Sherman avenue. Crossing this viaduct the visitor will find himself in a beautiful park stretching away to the south, with the Horticultural building, the Apiary building, the Aquarium, the Nebraska and other State buildings grouped in a pleasing manner. Here also, will be a band stand which will be a most attractive piece of architectural design. This portion of the grounds will be parked and planted with large numbers of shade trees and plenty of grass. Along the edge of the bluff, but far enough from the edge to take out of the view the unsightly structures which disfigure the foreground, will be a wide promenade from which may be had a magnificent view of the broad valley of the Missouri.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">AMUSEMENT FEATURES.</head>
<p>That portion of this section of the grounds lying to the north of the viaduct across Sherman avenue will be devoted to the amusement section, or plaisance. Here will be grouped the several villages, the palace of beauty, the Turkish Harem, and the manifold other attractions. This section will extend to the northern portion of this part of the grounds and here will be another viaduct across Sherman avenue, over which the visitor may pass to the tract known as the old fair grounds. Here will be found more of the plaisance, extending as far west as Twentieth street, being so arranged that the visitor cannot pass from the main portion of the grounds on the south to any other portion of the grounds on the south to any other portion without passing through the plaisance.</p>
<p>That section of the grounds lying north and west of the old fair grounds will be devoted to the agricultural and live stock sections of the exposition. Here will be located the horses, cattle, sheep, hogs, poultry, etc., and the irrigation exhibits, including exhibits of various methods of irrigation, growing crops under irrigation, etc.</p>
<p>The section devoted to sports will also be located in this portion of the grounds, and the base ball cranks will have a field all to themselves, while grounds will be prepared for bicycle races, football, and other sports.</p>
<p>The question of the locating of entrances for railway passengers and other details will be discussed more fully when the committee meets at the grounds today.</p></div3></div2>

<head type="sub">Erection of Fence Will be Commenced Soon.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The topographical survey of the exposition grounds is about completed and the map of the portions of the ground lying west of Sherman avenue has been nearly finished.</p>
<p>The lumber for the fence around the grounds has not arrived, with the exception of a few of the posts. Superintendent Geraldine says it will probably be several days before work is commenced on the fence.</p>
<p>The members of the executive committee will meet with the members of the Board of Park Commissioners at the city hall tonight for the purpose of consulting regarding the work to be done by he park board in aid of the exposition.</p>
<p>Edward W. Parker of Washington D. C., statistician of the United States geological survey, is in the city and met the members of the executive committee today for consultation regarding the co-operation of the bureau with the Department of Exhibits in the matter of the mineral exhibit. Mr. Parker was one of the judges of awards in the mining department at the World's fair and was assistant chief of the Department of Mines and Mining at the Atlanta exposition. He stated to a Bee representative that the geological survey was ready to co-operate with the exposition management in every possible manner in securing a creditable exhibit of minerals and would take up the work whenever asked by the management to assist.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">RANSOM’S STARTLING CONFESSION.</head>
<p>Mr. Ransom made an equally lengthy reply to the remarks of his Lancaster county colleague. In the course of his remarks Mr. Ransom created <choice><sic>somthing</sic><corr>something</corr></choice> of a sensation by a statement relative to the passage of the Transmississippi Exposition bill. He declared that lathough he spoke for and worked for the passage of the exposition bill, in his heart he wanted the bill to fail. He said that he had made a speech urging an increase of $50,000 in the exposition appropriation because men on the outside had compelled him to. Later in his speech he brought up the exposition appropriation again and said he had gone to many senators with the statement that he would be compelled to make a speech in favor of increasing the appropriation, but at the same time he had privately requested those same senators to vote against his amendment.</p>
<p>"Who compelled you to make that speech?" asked Senator Mutz.</p>
<p>"Why, the gang in Omaha," was Ransom's reply.</p></div3></div2>

    <head type="sub">KOUNTZE MODIFIES PROPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">Conditions of His Gift of Land to the City.</head>
<p>President Wattles of the exposition and Messrs. Tukey and Kilpatrick of the park commissioners, called on Herman Kountze yesterday morning to see if he could not be induced to modify the conditions connected with his proposed gift of five and one-half acres of ground to the city included in the exposition grounds. The interview was very satisfactory, and, while no papers have been drawn, it is conceded that an agreement will be reached within a few days.</p>
<p>Mr. Kountze had modified his conditions in regard to the permanent art building to be maintained on the tract to the extent that it shall be left to the park commission to decide after the close of the exposition whether the building shall be so maintained. In regard to Twentieth street, through Kountze Place, being exempt from special taxes, it has been agreed that it shall be placed under the same ruling as other boulevards and park property. Mr. Kountze also modified his price for the other five acres of land on the west side of Twentieth street, which he proposed to sell to the city. He has now agreed to sell it for $10,000 instead of $15,000 and it is thought now that the exposition association will buy the tract and present it to the city at the close of the exposition.</p>
<p>Mr. Tukey of the park board said yesterday afternoon that the interview was of such character that the commissioners will plan to expend the $30,000 or $40,000 fund on this ten-acre tract in improving it for the exposition.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">GIVE DOUGLAS COUNTY A CHANCE.</head>
<p>At last after a hard fight the committee of the whole in the house has favorably recommended for passage the bill which gives to Douglas county the right to vote bonds to aid the exposition.</p>
<p>The amount which can be voted is limited to $100.000</p>
<p>On Monday morning this bill will come to a vote in the house and the World-Herald appeals to all fair minded members to vote for it.</p>
<p>These is no excuse for opposing it. It affects no county but Douglas and Douglas asks for it. It simply gives the people of this county the power to aid the exposition if they decide to do so at an election by a two-thirds vote.</p>
<p>Members who have opposed this measure out of spite or revenge may settle the matter with their own consciences. They must know that they have done something to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>Time is short. Every hour's delay imperils this bill. Adjournment comes on Wednesday. The bill must go to the senate Monday.</p>
<p>Concerning the friends of this bill, those outside of Douglas county as well as those from Douglas county, a good word should be said and their good work should not be forgotten. They have struggled patiently and persistently and they have entitled themselves to the gratitude of all friends of the exposition.</p></div2>
    
    <div2 type="article">
<head type="sub">EXPOSITION BONDS.</head>
<p>The next bill on the general file was house roll No. 578, by John Fitz Roberts. A bill for an act to authorize counties to participate in interstate expositions, to issue bonds for such purpose, and to provide for a tax for the payment of such bonds. This is the bill to authorize Douglas county to vote bonds in aid of the Trans-Mississippi exposition to the amount of $250,000, when two-thirds of the voters cast their ballots in the affirmative.</p>
<p>There was a motion made by Clark of Lincoln that the committee arise before the clerk could call the name of this bill. The committee voted it down, however, and then commenced the fight.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><note>upside down glued in clip</note><p>the papal delegate, who left this afternoon for Ottowa, has called a conference of the Roman Catholic archbishops of Canada to be held in the archbishop's palace at Montreal next Thursday.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><div3><p>of Douglas stated that some amendments were devised which would remove the objections of the people in the western part of the county. Clark, Burkett and Waite on Lancaster, Wooster, Gaylord and Winslow opposed the bill. These set up the claim that the bill was intended to enable the exposition stockholders to vote the bonds and turn the money over to the stock subscription that had been made to the exposition stock and in that way make the state appropriation available.</p>
<p>Clark of Lancaster sent over some memoranda to Wooster and the latter took a new tack and gave it as his opinion that the bill was unconstitutional. That it was class legislature. Hill said that Rich of Douglas had said that the bill was unconstitutional if passed in the form proposed.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">AMENDMENT'S ADOPTED.</head>
<p>Amendments were adopted specifically stating that it should only apply to counties having over 100,000 inhabitants, and reducing the amount of bonds which could be voted to $100,000.</p>
<p>Winslow offered an amendment providing that the city of Omaha should vote on the proposition to issue the bonds. Clark of Lancaster proposed one providing that the maximum limit of the bond issue should be $50,000. Those by Clark and Winslow were lost.</p>
<p>The opponents of the bill contended that the farmers of Douglas county did not want it passed and "That it was a scheme of Omaha to vote bonds on the farmers against the desire of the later. Hill of Clay said he was in favor of letting Omaha have it if she wanted it, "and the sooner they bonded themselves to death the better."</p>
<p>Pollard, Shull, Kapp, Horner, Jones of Nemaha and Roberts, Felker, Smith and Baldwin of Douglas spoke for the measure.</p>
<p>Kapp said he believed that it would be safe to submit the proposition to the people of Douglas. He had no doubt but that two-thirds of the people of that county could come nearer deciding what they wanted and what was good for them than three or four gentlemen living in Lancaster.</p>
<p>The motion to indefinitely postpone was defeated by a vote of 16 to 28.</p>
<p>Burkett raised the point of order that there was quorum present. Wheeler, who was in the chair, held that the point of order was not well taken.</p>
<p>The committee recommended that the bill be engrossed for third reading as amended.</p>
<p>House roll No. 549, by committee on manufactures and commerce, D. N. Jones, chairman, a bill for an act o provide for the testing of gasoline and fix the regulation thereof, was taken up and recommended for passage. The committee arose and reported and the report was adopted in part.</p></div3></div2>

<p>The lady managers of the exposition will meet for organization this afternoon in the directors' room in the Paxton block. Transportation has been sent to all the out of town members and a full attendance of the board is expected.</p>
<p>There is not much talk as to who the president shall be, though it is quite generally considered that she should be chosen from outside Omaha and South Omaha. For secretary there are several candidates, among them being Mrs. Frances Ford of this city, Mrs. Emma Shuman of Nebraska City, Mrs. Mary Allan Bock of Omaha, Mrs. Rose M. Owens of Bloomington, and Mrs. C. M. Woodard of Seward. It is the sentiment of the Omaha women that one of their number should be given the place because the duties of the position will require constant and engrossing attention.</p>

<p>Supervising Architects Walker and Kimball are just now busy making new drawings of the general plan, as submitted to the members of the executive committee, to be sent on to the architectural exhibit which opens today in Boston. Space has been telegraphed for and the work will be forwards in a day or two.</p>
<p>The architects will then decide on the plans of the individual buildings and hope to be able to get the specifications into the hands of the building architects this week.</p>
<p>It will be definitely known in a few days just what the park board will do in the matter of aiding the exposition in the improvement of grounds. Its members and some of the officers of the exposition have had conferences with Mr. Kountze, and the latter, it is understood, will modify the terms on which he offered ground to the city for park purposes. He will leave it optional with the park board whether it will erect a permanent building on the tract of five and a half acres, and he will let the city have the five and a half acres to the west for $10,000 in stead of $15,000 as at first proposed. The park board will not buy any land for park purposes, but there is some talk that the exposition association will buy the ground and then give it to the park board when the exposition is over, provided the park board will improve the whole eleven acres for the exposition. Mr. Tukey of the park board says that this proposition would be accepted.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">FIRST BUILDING TO BE A SPECTATORIUM</head>
<head type="sub">Executive Committee Practically Decides to Purchase Five Acres, Which Will Be Donated to the City After the Exposition.</head>
    <div3>
<p>Active work on the preparation of the exposition grounds will be commenced within the next ten days and the grounds will be enlivened by throngs of graders excavating the beds of the lakes and lagoons which will form a striking feature of the great fair. The series of lakes and lagoons on the Kountze tract will be about one-half a mile in length and will vary from 150 to 450 feet in width. The depth will vary from three feet to fifteen feet.</p>
<p>The contract for this week will be awarded at the meeting of the executive committee of the exposition to be held at noon Saturday on this week. This was decided at a meeting of the executive committee held last night, the Department of Buildings and Grounds being authorized to advertise for bids for doing this grading. <choice><sic>bids</sic><corr>Bids</corr></choice> to be received until 10 a. m. Saturday of this week at the office of the Department of Buildings and Grounds on the sixth floor of the Paxton block. Contractors on this work will be required to comply with the provisions of the rule adopted by the board of directors at its last meeting, requiring all contracts to contain a clause providing that unskilled labor shall be paid $1.50 per day for ten hours' work.</p>
<p>The executive committee decided that the first building upon which work shall be commenced shall be a theater building to be called the Spectatorium. This will be designed as a concession and will also be used for meetings of various kinds when not in use for theatrical performances. This building will be constructed on the west side of Twentieth street, on a portion of the ground designed to be donated to the city for a public park. The Spectatorium will have a seating capacity of 3,500 and will cost not to exceed $35,000. The executive committee has a proposition before it from one of the best known managers of spectacular productions in this country, who proposes to execute a lease of the building and guarantee an income to the Exposition association which will practically pay the entire cost of the structure.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WILL BUY FIVE ACRES.</head>
<p>It has been practically decided that the Exposition association will purchase from Mr. Kountze the five and one-half acres of ground lying immediately west of Twentieth street for $10,000 and donate it to the city for a public park after the exposition is over, in connection with a similar tract on the east side of Twentieth street, donated by Mr. Kountze. It is on this piece of ground that it is proposed to construct the Spectatorium.</p>
<p>The preliminary plans showing the locations and outlines of main buildings as submitted by the architects at the last meeting were formally approved by the committee, subject to change.</p>
<p>The program for the jubilee celebration to be held on Arbor day, April 22, as reported by the special committee appointed for that purpose, was approved by the committee and the special committee was authorized to carry out the arrangements.</p>
<p>This program is about as follows: A monster parade will form a prominent feature of the celebration. This parade will comprise all of the military and civic societies in this vicinity, invitations to participate having been sent out during the past week by the special committee. City and county officials will also be invited to take part in the parade and the affair will be made as imposing and large as possible. The procession will form in the vicinity of Seventeenth and Farnam streets and will march east of Farnam to Twelfth street, north to Douglas, west to Sixteenth and north on Sixteenth to the exposition grounds. The oratorical portion of the exercises will take place in the old grandstand on the fair grounds. Invitations to speak will be sent at once to Governor Holcomb of Nebraska, Governor Drake of Iowa, Hon. W. J. Bryan, Hon. J. Sterling Morton, Hon. John Baldwin of Council Bluffs and Mayor Broatch of Omaha.</p>
<p>After the speaking the crowd will adjourn to the lower part of the grounds where the corner stone of one of the large main buildings will be laid with appropriate ceremonies and the work of making the exposition will then have been formally inaugurated.</p></div3></div2>

</lg>

<p>The foregoing is the list of officers and executive committee of the Lady Board of Managers of the Bureau of Education of the Transmississippi Exposition who were elected at the first meeting of the board, which was held at exposition headquarters in the Paxton block yesterday afternoon and last night.</p>
<p>The full membership of the board was on hand at the opening of the session, and the proceedings were characterized by a snap and vigor and an intelligent understanding of the purposes of the organization which spoke volumes in favor of the ultimate success of the object for which the board was created.</p>
<p>The disposition which seemed to prevail in the selection of officers was in favor of giving all sections of the state representation, and this was carried out, as will be seen by the list of officers.</p>
<p>Every member of the board was present as follows: Miss Anna Foos, Miss Kate McHugh, Miss Alice Hitte, Mesdames O. S. Chittenden, S. R. Towne, W. W. Keysor, W. P. Harford, E. A. Cudahy, J. H. McIntosh, T. L. Kimball and Euclid Martin, Omaha; Mrs. E. B. Towle and Mrs. A. A. Munro, South Omaha; Mrs. J. R. Reed and Mrs. S. C. Key, Council Bluffs; Mrs. A. J. Sawyer and Mrs. A. W. Field, Lincoln; Mrs. Angeline Whitney, Elk City; Mrs. Helen Chase, Papillion; Mrs. D. C. Giffert, West Point; Mrs. Nettie Hollenbeck, Fremont; Mrs. J. B. McDowell, Fairbury; Mrs. F. Johnson, Crete; Mrs. William Dutton and Miss Fyffe, Hastings; Mrs. M. A. Hunter, Broken Bow; Mrs. J. H. Kerr, Ansley.</p>
<p>The meeting was called to order by Mrs. Towne, who introduced Manager Bruce of the Department of Exhibits.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">MANAGER BRUCE'S OPPORTUNITY.</head>
<p>Mr. Bruce was evidently laboring under considerable embarrassment, but he overcame it sufficiently to make the women a short speech, relating to the importance of the work before them, and then he called for nominations for temporary chairman.</p>
<p>Miss Anna Foos was nominated, but declined the honor. Mrs. A. W. Field of Lincoln was then nominated and elected, and Mrs. Hollenbeck of Fremont was elected temporary secretary.</p>
<p>The chairman asked if the meeting would elect permanent officers as the next step in the proceedings. In reply Mrs. Harford of Omaha suggested an informal discussion of the plan and scope of the work of the board before proceeding to elect officers.</p>
<p>Mrs. Towne suggested having a president, two vice presidents, a secretary and an executive committee to perform the functions of the board during the intervals between sessions of the full board.</p>
<p>A number of the members suggested having more than two vice presidents, on in each state being suggested.</p>
<p>Mrs. Towne replied that the work of the board should be done largely through the medium of committees. She also said a vice president in each state would not be necessary, in view of the fact that the plan of organization provides for an advisory council composed of two women from each of the transmississippi states.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harford said there was need of only a sufficient number of vice presidents to insure the presence of a presiding officer at the meetings.</p>
<p>Mrs. Johnson of Crete moved the appointment of a committee of five to draft a plan of organization for the work of the board.</p>
<p>The committee was appointed from the floor and comprised the following women: Mrs. Reed of Council bluffs, Mrs. Sawyer of Lincoln, Mrs. Dutton of Hastings, Mrs. Hollenbeck of Fremont and Mrs. Harford of Omaha.</p>
<p>The chair showed familiarity with convention proceedings by asking if the committee had a report already typewritten for the consideration of the board. When the committee had recovered from the prostration induced by this rather pointed insinuation, it retired to a private room for consultation, but the question of the chair remained unanswered.</p>
<p>While the committee was out the other members of the board indulged in an informal discussion of the work of the board. This discussion showed that nearly all of the members had given the matter considerable attention and a great variety of ideas were advanced.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">AGITATED OVER EXPENSES.</head>
<p>The discussion drifted around until the question of the expenses of the members was raised by Mrs. Towne asking whether the members from outside of Omaha would be present at all of the meetings.</p>
<p>Several of the women from outside districts expressed themselves very strongly as being opposed to paying their own expenses while in attendance upon the meetings of the board.</p>
<p>Mrs. Keysor of Omaha stated that Secretary Wakefield had informed her that the executive committee had made no provision for paying any of the expenses of the members.</p>
<p>Mrs. McDowell of Fairbury expressed herself very forcibly on the question and said the mend who went to Mexico did not pay their expense and she, for one, didn't intend to be imposed on by paying heavy hotel bills. She said she had no objections to the men, as they were "good people," but she said if this board was composed of men there would be no question about paying their expenses, and she was determined to be placed on an equal footing with the men.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hunter of Broken Bow said she was engaged in school work and had been obliged to employ a substitute while she came to Omaha, and she thought it unreasonable to expect her to pay her substitute and also pay her expenses in Omaha. She said she intended to attend all of the meetings, but did not propose to pay her own expenses.</p>
<p>Mrs. J. H. Kerr of Ansley said she and Mrs. Hunter had been elected to represent the Big Sixth, and they would be at every meeting of the board, but she said she had been told by some of the men in Custer county that it would be very unusual to ask the members of the board to pay their expenses while attending meetings.</p>
<p>No action was taken in the matter.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">HOW THEY WILL WORK.</head>
<p>The special committee to prepare a plan submitted its report. This was read by Mrs. Sawyer of Lincoln, secretary of the committee.</p>
<p>This plan, as adopted by the board, after discussing it in detail, is as follows:</p>
<p>"Sec. 1. This body shall be known by the title of the Board of Managers of the Bureau of Education of the Transmississippi and International Exposition.</p>
<p>"Sec. 2. A quorum of the board shall be a majority of the members.</p>
<p>"Sec. 3. The officers of this board shall consist of a president, three vice presidents and a secretary.</p>
<p>"There shall be an executive committee of seven, two of whom shall be the president and first vice president, who shall be ex-officio members of the committee. Four members of the committee shall constitute a quorum.</p>
<p>"The executive committee, when the Board of Managers is not in session, shall have all the powers of the board. The committee may make regulations for its own government and the exercise of its functions through the medium of such subcommittees as it may consider expedient.</p>
<p>"The committee shall distinctly define the duties of all appointees. It shall fully report all its transactions to the Board of Managers at its stated and special meetings.</p>
<p>"In case of vacancy in the committee the same shall be filled by the board.</p>
<p>"Sec. 4. The secretary of the Board of Managers shall act as secretary of the executive committee, and in such capacity shall be directed and controlled by the executive committee.</p>
<p>"Sec. 5. The duties of the president an vice presidents shall be such as usually pertain to those respective offices. The duties of the secretary shall be to conduct the correspondence of the board and of the executive committee and be the custodian of all papers, documents and records relating to their business. She shall keep a full and complete record of their proceedings and shall make report of the same from time to time as she may be required. All papers and records in her custody shall at all times be open to inspection on demand of any manager.</p>
<p>"Sec. 6. A vacancy in the board shall be filled by the board from the district in which the vacancy occurs.</p>
<p>"Sec. 7. The regular meetings of the Board of Managers shall be on the first Tuesday of every third month, dating from April 6, 1897. Special meetings shall be called by the president at the request of the majority of the executive committee."</p>

<pb n="150" xml:id="TMISB02-150"/>



<p>The special committee also recommended the appointment of a nominating committee of five members to suggest names of candidates for offices.</p>
<p>This recommendation was adopted and the following women were nominated: Miss Foos, Mesdames Reed, Johnson, Kerr, Towle, Key, Kimball, Hollenbeck and Giffert and Miss McHugh.</p>
<p>To expedite matters the chairman took a viva voce vote on the first five names and declared them elected without calling for a vote on the other five.</p>
<p>The question of instructing the committee was raised and Mrs. Hunter said the president, first vice president and secretary should be elected from Omaha, so they would always be on hand.</p>
<p>Mrs. McDowell opposed this and said she was "not opposed to Omaha, but &#8212;."</p>
<p>The committee finally retired without instructions.</p>
<p>After being out nearly an hour the committee returned, but before the report was read a motion to adjourn until 7:30 p. m. was carried on account of the lateness of the hour, 6 o'clock.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">ELECTS PERMANENT OFFICERS.</head>
<p>When the board reconvened shortly after 7:30 o'clock the report of the nominating committee was read. The committee nominated the following candidates: Fore president, Mrs. Sawyer, Mrs. Field; for first vice president, Mrs. Kimball, Mrs. Harford; for second vice president, Mrs. Dutton, Mrs. McDowell; for third vice president, Mrs. Kerr, Mrs. Johnson; for secretary, Mrs. Ford, Mrs. Bock, both of Omaha, Mrs. Shuman of Nebraska City; for members of executive committee, Mrs. McIntosh, Mrs. Harford, Mrs. Keysor, Mrs. Towle, Miss McHugh, Mrs. Towne, Mrs. Reed, Mrs. Hollenbeck, Mrs. Cudahy, Mrs. Giffert.</p>
<p>The vote on president stood as follows: Mas. Sawyer, 14; Mrs. Field, 8. Mrs. Sawyer was elected.</p>
<p>On first vice president the vote stood: Mrs. Kimball, 16; Mrs. Harford, 9. Mrs. Kimball was elected.</p>
<p>On second vice president the vote was: Mrs. Dutton, 17; Mrs. McDowell, 7. Mrs. Dutton was elected.</p>
<p>For third vice president the following was cast: Mrs. Kerr, 11; Mrs. Johnson, 13. Mrs. Johnson was elected.</p>
<p>Before the vote on secretary was read the chair announced that several applications had been received by Secretary Wakefield and that these would be read for the information of the board. The secretary then read applications from Mrs. F. M. Ford, Mrs. Mary Allan Bock, Omaha; Mrs. Emma Shuman, Nebraska City; Mrs. C. M. Woodward, Seward, and Miss Rose M. Owens, Bloomington.</p>
<p>Some of these applications were accompanied by numerous letters of recommendation, but the meeting decided to dispense with the reading of these documents and the voting was commenced.</p>
<p>Before the ballots were counted Mrs. Towl of South Omaha asked if she might be allowed to vote the verbal proxy of Mrs. Munro of South Omaha, who was unable to be present. The request was denied by the board.</p>
<p>The ballot resulted as follows: Mrs. Ford, 19; Mrs. Bock, 4; Mrs. Shuman, 1; Miss Foos, 1. Mrs. Ford was declared elected.</p>
<p>The first ballot for the five members of the executive committee resulted as follows: Mrs. McIntosh, 9; Mrs. Harford, 22; Mrs. Keysor, 23; Mrs. Towl, 4; Miss McHugh, 16; Mrs. Towne, 11; Mrs. Reed, 14, Mrs. Hollenbeck, 8; Mrs. Cudahy, 8; Mrs. Giffert, 5; Mrs. Kerr, 1; Mrs. McDowell, 2; Mrs. Whitney, 2, Mrs. Harford, Mrs. Keysor, Miss McHugh and Mrs. Reed were declared elected.</p>
<p>Before the second ballot was taken Mrs. McIntosh and Mrs. Cudahy withdrew. The second, third, and fourth ballots resulted in no choice. The fifth resulted as follows: Mrs. Towl, 1; Mrs. Towne, 7; Mrs. Giffert, 16. Mrs. Giffert was declared elected.</p>            
<p>The temporary chairman declared the organization completed and called the president, Mrs. A. J. Sawyer, to the chair.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sawyer thanked the members for the honor conferred upon her and warned the members of the board that they were entering upon an unknown territory. She cautioned thoughtfulness and moderation, and expressed the hope that the harmonious feeling which had characterized the proceedings thus far should continue.</p>
<p>The meeting was then adjourned until 10 o'clock this morning, the executive committee being notified to meet at 9 o'clock.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">THIS MORNING'S MEETING</head>
<p>All of the members were present except Mrs. Munro of South Omaha and Mrs. McIntosh of Omaha when the board met this morning.</p>
<p>Mrs. F. M. Ford, who was elected secretary, was introduced to the board by President Sawyer. Mrs. Ford thanked the members for the honor conferred upon her and promised to perform the duties of the office to the best of her ability.</p>
<p>At the suggestion of the president the board proceeded to hold a "love feast" for informal discussion. It developed very soon that the members had a very indefinite idea as to whether any money was to be expended through the board in securing exhibits. Mrs. Harford explained that when the buildings and grounds were finished by the exposition association it could not be reasonably expected that exhibitions should be paid for making exhibits.</p>
<p>Miss Fyffe of Hastings suggested that a special feature should be made of schools of the rural districts, for the reason that these schools are an important factor in all western <choice><sic>tsates</sic><corr>states</corr></choice>.</p>
<p>The president suggested that an effort be made to secure a portion of the Nebraska appropriation as soon as the state commission shall have been appointed by the governor, her idea being to have a portion of the appropriation set aside for an educational exhibit.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cudahy moved the appointment <unclear reason="folded"> committee of two to confer with the commission to be appointed by the governor. The motion was carried, and a motion by Mrs. Field that the committee consist of the president and secretary was also adopted.</unclear></p>
<p>A communication from Mrs. McIntosh, tendering her resignation, was read. A motion by Mrs. Keysor that the resignation be accepted was adopted.</p>
<p>The matter of filling the vacancy was taken up at once, and Mrs. Harford nominated Mrs. Stella Rosewater Feil. Mrs. Harford said that Mrs. Feil was the twelfth woman on the list at the election held in Omaha, being the next below the eleventh woman elected.</p>
<p>Mrs. Keysor doubted the policy of establishing the precedent of taking the next highest on the list, as it might prove troublesome. She said Mrs. Feil was a highly qualified woman and should be elected solely on her competency without regard to the vote at the election.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">MRS. FEIL ELECTED.</head>
<p>The vote was taken by rising and Mrs. Feil was unanimously chosen.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chittenden said she was a delegate to the International Kindergarten association which meets in St. Louis next week, and she moved the appointment of a committee of two to send an invitation to the association to meet in Omaha in 1898. The motion was adopted, as was another motion providing that the president and secretary should constitute the committee to co-operate with Mrs. Chittenden in extending an invitation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harford moved that steps be taken to secure the holding of the 1898 session of the National Educational association in Omaha. This was adopted and Miss Foos, Miss McHugh and the president and secretary were appointed as the committee.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ford suggested that the National Music Teachers' association meets in New York City early n May and recommended that steps be taken to secure the meeting next year for Omaha.</p>
<p>On motion of Mrs. Reed an invitation was extended to the association and Mrs. Cudahy and Mrs. Hollenbeck were appointed a committee to secure the co-operation of western musicians in this connection.</p>
<p>Miss Hitte suggested that the Western Drawing Teacher's association will meet in St. Louis next week, and a motion was carried authorizing Miss Hitte to extend an official invitation to the association to meet in Omaha next year.</p>
<p>Mrs. Field moved the appointment of the two members of the board from each congressional district to reach the summer schools and normal schools and interest the teachers of the state in the work of the board. The motion was adopted.</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin brought up the question of the expenses of the outside members. She said something should be done to at least lighten the burden of the outside delegates and she moved the appointment of a committee of two to see what arrangement will be made by the exposition executive committee.</p>
<p>The motion was adopted and Mrs. Martin and Mrs. Cudahy were selected as the committee.</p>
<p>The committee was instructed to report to the executive committee, and then the board adjourned.</p>
<p>The executive committee of the Board of Managers held a short session this morning before the board meeting and adjourned subject to  call of the secretary.</p>
<p>All of the members of the committee were present except Vice President Kimball. Mrs. Frances M. Ford, the secretary of the board and of the committee, was installed in office.</p>
<p>The work of the committee was discussed in an informal manner after Mrs. W. p. Harford had been chosen as temporary chairman.</p>
<p>The method in which the work of the board should be formulated formed the subject of a prolonged discussion. The province of the Board of Managers being to assume full charge of educational matters in the broadest sense of that term, the discussion naturally turned on the classification of the various educational branches. The discussion was very general, but no definite action was taken before the time arrived for the entire board to meet and the committee adjourned without perfecting a permanent organization.</p></div3></div2>

<head type="sub">Decided That Theater Building Shall Be First on Exposition Grounds.</head>
<head type="sub">To Have a Seating Capacity of 3,500 and Be Completed by Fall.</head>
<head type="sub">Closing of Pinckney Street&#8212;-C. A. Starr Resigns&#8212;-How Work Shall Be Awarded to Architects.</head>
    <div3>
<p>It has been decided by the executive committee that what is to be called the "Spectatorium," or the theater building, will be constructed first. The aim is to make it a light, airy affair, and as pretty as possible. It will have three gallerias and a seating capacity of about 3,500, the main part being surrounded by a foyer with standing room for 1,000. The estimated cost is $35,000, and an effort will be made to bring it below that figure.</p>
<p>A large part of the cost will return to the pockets of the association, for one of the most prominent spectacular managers of the country is ready to enter into a contract for the use of the building for his entertainments, and guarantees a return to the exposition of $24,000 out of the large percentage which he offers out of his receipts. He will use the building every night in the week, and on two afternoons of each week, and the rest of the time it can be used for any purpose, such as the holding of conventions, congresses and concerts. This building will be situated just west of Twentieth street on the Kountze tract and will be so made that it can afterwards be converted into a permanent building, if that be desired. It is expected that the building can be opened by next fall, and it will be the intention of the management to make it bring in revenue even before the opposition opens from the entertainments of one kind and another that will be arranged for.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">LUMBER IS DELAYED.</head>
<p>Yesterday scores of men were in the corridor leading to Superintendent Geraldine's room in the Paxton block, and still more were collected at Eighteenth and Pinckney streets expecting that work would be begun on the fencing, but they were disappointed. The same thing had been witnessed yesterday morning. The delay is caused by the failure of the lumber to arrive. It is expected any day and then no time will be lost in getting the saws and hammers to work.</p>
<p>It is thought very desirable to add the width of Pinckney street to the Kountze tract on the south, and an ordinance closing the street is being prepared to submit to the city council this evening. In case the street is closed the fence will be run along the south curb line. There are only three or four hoses facing north on this street, and all of them have considerable yards, and it is not thought that there will be any serious objection to the plan.</p>
<p>C. A. Starr, superintendent of the subscription department, has resigned, finding that his work was interfering too seriously with his private business. It is doubtful if the position will be filled, for the work of this department is so nearly completed that it is not thought necessary to have a man solely to look after it.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">CALLED TO BOSTON.</head>
<p>Supervising Architect Walker has been called temporarily to Boston by professional engagements.</p>
<p>The question as to how the work on the different buildings will be awarded to architects has not been fully decided. The supervising architects want it to be by ordinary engagement, but there are several members of the executive committee who are anxious that it be by competitive drawings. It is urged by the supervising architects that there is now not time for this, and they say that anyhow the best results cannot be obtained by competition. The executive committee will take action on the matter soon.</p></div3></div2>

Field of Lincoln; Mrs. Omar Whitney of Elk City; Miss Helen Chase of Papillion; Mrs. D. C. Giffert of West Point; Mrs. Hollenbeck of Fremont; Mrs. Dutton and Miss Tyffe of Hastings; Mrs. J. B. McDowell of Fairbury; Mrs. F. Johnson of Crete; Mrs. C. L. Kerr of Ansley, and Mrs. Hattie Hunter of Broken Bow.</p>
<p>All were present at the meeting, and a lively interest, thought to presage the sure success of the work the women have undertaken in connection with the exposition, was taken in all the proceedings.</p>
<p>Mr. Bruce, manager of the department of exhibits, with some embarrassment, called the meeting to order. He said that as a member of the executive committee he had up to this time performed his duties with a great deal of trepidation, but that a look into the faces of those present fortified him and made him feel like undertaking still a great deal more for the enterprise.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">SELECT A CHAIRMAN.</head>
<p>For temporary chairman Mrs. Towne named Miss Foos and Miss Foos declined, naming Mrs. Towne. The latter also declines and Mrs. A. W. Field of Lincoln was chosen. Mrs. Hollenbeck of Fremont was made temporary secretary.</p>
<p>The chairman intimidated that the proper thing to do was to proceed to effect a permanent organization, and Mrs. Towne proposed that the board should have a president, two vice presidents and an executive committee.</p>
<p>There was with some an impression that the vice presidents would have charge of various departments, and Mrs. Keysor, Miss Foos and others believed that it would be better to have more than two vice presidents.</p>
<p>Some seemed to think that the vice presidencies were to be positions of honor more than anything else, and Mrs. Kimball suggested that the vice presidents be chosen from the auxiliary council that is to be composed of two women from each of the trans-Mississippi states.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dutton inquired if the vice presidents were to have any special power or were to perform merely the usual duties of the office.</p>
<p>The majority agreed with Mrs. Towne that they should be selected merely to act in the absence of the president.</p>
<p>At the suggestion of Mrs. McIntosh, and on the motion of Mrs. Johnson, a committee of five, comprising Mrs. Reed, Mrs. Sawyer, Mrs. Dutton, Mrs. Hollenbeck and Mrs. Harford, was appointed on organization.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WANT EXPENSES PAID.</head>
<p>While the committee was out a number of subjects were discussed at great random. Among them was the obligation of members to attend all the meetings of the board, and naturally the remarks were chiefly made by women from out of the city. Mrs. Kerr of Ansley said she and her colleagues had been chosen to represent the "big sixth" and they proposed to represent it. They were followed by a number of others, who signified their intention of being present at every meeting. Then the question of expenses came up. Mrs. Hunter of Broken Bow said she had put a substitute in the school room to come to this meeting, a thing which she could not do often. Mrs. McDowell of Fairbury declared that the men were real nice fellows; she had nothing to say against them; but they would allow women to work for nothing. She would do charity work for nothing, she said, but did not think she ought to be expected to work for the great Trans-Mississippi exposition without at least compensation for expenses.</p>
<p>A committee of one went in to ask Secretary Wakefield about the matter of expenses, and brought back the information that the executive committee of the directory had made no arrangements in regard to it further than to provide transportation for the out of town members.</p>
<p>Here the matter was dropped for the present.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">REPORT ON ORGANIZATION.</head>
<p>The organization committee recommended that the board should be called the board of lady managers of the bureau of education of the Trans-Mississippi exposition, that it should meet on the first Tuesday of every third month; that a majority should constitute a quorum; that the officers should be a president, three vice presidents and a secretary; that there should be an executive committee of five, three of whom should constitute a quorum, and that the committee should have all the powers of the board when the latter was not in session; that the board fill all vacancies in membership that might occur; that the secretary of the board be the secretary of the executive committee name as many sub-committees as it needed.</p>
<p>It was decided that the executive committee should consist of seven, that four should make a quorum and that the president and first vice president of the board should be ex-officio members of the committee. It was decided also that when a vacancy occurs it shall be filled by the selection of a party from the same district. In all other respects the report of the committee was adopted.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">COMMITTEE ON NOMINATIONS.</head>
<p>Mesdames Reed, Johnson, Kerr and Towl and Miss Foss were selected as the committee on nominations.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hunter moved that the committee be <choice><sic>instucted</sic><corr>instructed</corr></choice> to recommend Omaha women for president and first vice president, but this met with such objection that the matter was withdrawn. Mrs. Hunter took pains to say that the object of the motion was not to facilitate the election of a secretary from outside Omaha; she was willing that the secretary, too, be an Omaha woman.</p>
<p>Mrs. Towne and Mrs. Keysor were among those who spoke against the motion. Mrs. Towne said that the Omaha women though it essential that the secretary should be a resident of this city, and they did not want everything.</p>
<p>A few minutes before 6 o'clock the nominating committee returned ready to report, but without its being read, an adjournment was taken to 7:30.</p>
<p>The nominating committee presented the following names: For president, Mrs. Sawyer, Mrs. Field; first vice president, Mrs. Kimball, Mrs. Harford; second vice president, Mrs. Dutton, Mrs. McDowell; third vice president, Mrs. Kerr, Mrs. Johnson; secretary, Mrs. Ford, Mrs. Bock, Mrs. Shuman; executive committee, Mrs. McIntosh, Mrs. Harford, Mrs. Keysor, Mrs. Towl, Miss McHugh, Mrs. Towne, Mrs. Reed, Mrs. Hollenbeck, Mrs. Cudahy, Mrs. Giffert.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">BALLOTS TAKEN.</head>
<p>Before the balloting began Mrs. Field said that the choices of the Lincoln women for president was Mrs. Sawyer and she would decline in favor of Mrs. Sawyer. The latter declined in favor of Mrs. Field, but no serious respect was paid to the remarks of either woman, and the ballot, with Mrs. Kimball and Mrs. Monroe absent, was taken.</p>
<p>The result was: Sawyer, 14; Field, 8; Mrs. Cudahy, 2. Mrs. Sawyer was declared elected.</p>
<p>The vote on first vice president was: Kimball, 16; Harford, 9.</p>
<p>Second vice president: Dutton, 17; McDowell, 7.</p>
<p>Third vice president: Johnson, 13; Kerr, 11.</p>
<p>When it came to the election of a secretary the chairman stated that as applications for the position had been made by others than those suggested by the committee she thought all applications should be read, and they were, the applicants being Mrs. C. M. Woodward of Seward and Miss Rose M. Owens of Bloomington.</p>
<p>Mrs. Towl of South Omaha asked if she would be allowed to cast the vote of Mrs. Monroe of South Omaha, who ha asked her to do so, on secretary. Mrs. Towl was not allowed to do so.</p>
<p>The ballot resulted: Ford, 19; Shuman, 1; Bock, 4; Foos, 1.</p>
<p>For the executive committee the vote stood: Keysor, 234; Harford, 22; McHugh, 16; Reed, 14; Towne, 11; McIntosh, 9; Cudahy, 8; Hallenbeck, 8; Giffert, 5; Towl, 4; McDowell, 2; Whitney, 2; Kerr, 1.</p>
<p>The first four were declared elected and a ballot for the remaining number to be elected resulted: Towne, 6; Giffert, 5; Hallenbeck, 4; McDowell, 3; Towl, 3; Cudahy, 3; McIntosh 1. There being no choice another ballot was taken. The vote stood; Giffert, 7; Towne, 5; Cudahy, 4; Hallenbeck, 3; McDowell, 3; Towl, 1. Another ballot was taken and on the next Mrs. Giffert was elected, getting 16 votes, Mrs. Towne got 7 and Mrs. McDowell and Mrs. Towl 1 each.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">RECEIVED WITH CHEERS.</head>
<p>The president, Mrs. Sawyer, was then called to the chair amid cheers. She said that she was doing the trembling then, but feared those who put her in the position would tremble hereafter. She was sure, however, that the spirit of the present meeting augured success in the whole enterprise.</p>
<p>It was now 9:30. The women concluded they had not time to discuss the work they had undertaken and the board adjourned to 10 o'clock this morning. The executive committee will meet at 9 o'clock.</p></div3></div2>

    <head type="sub">RUSHES THE BOND BILL ALONG.</head>
<head type="sub">House Roll No. 578 Meets no Delay in the Senate.</head>
<p>LINCOLN, April 8,&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;In the senate this forenoon house roll No. 578, to permit Douglas county to vote $100,000 to aid the exposition, was read the second time and by unanimous vote advanced to third reading. The bill will reach its final passage some time tomorrow. After advancing a large number of house bills to third reading the senate resumed consideration of the salary appropriation bill.</p>
<p>Wheeler of Furnas gave notice to the house this morning that he would ask for a reconsideration of the vote on senate file No. 2, Haller's bill to prevent insurance combines, which passed the house yesterday.</p>
<p>As an explanation of his vote on senate file No. 199 Yeiser of Douglas sent in a resolution making charges that boodle had been used during the session on other bills and asking the governor to appoint a commission to investigate. The resolution was ruled out of order and by vote of the house was not put on record. Senate files Nos. 144, 199, 318 and 330 were passed. Senate file No. 23 failed to pass.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="main">EXPOSITION WORK BEGINS</head>
<head type="sub">ENCLOSING THE GROUNDS IS UNDER WAY</head>
<head type="sub">Indications that There Will Be Numerous Bids for Grading and Excavating for the Lakes and Lagoons.</head>
    <div3>
<p>Great signs of activity are being shown in connection with the Transmississippi Exposition. The work of erecting the fence enclosing the grounds is in full blast and the contractors are preparing to submit proposals for grading the lakes and lagoons on the Kountze tract.</p>
<p>Out at the grounds some twenty-five men under the direction of John F. Daley, a contractor, are engaged in setting fence posts for the tight board fence, eight feet in height, which is to enclose the entire grounds. Some delay in the work has been caused by the failure of part of the lumber to arrive. Some of the lumber is southern pine and the floods and demoralized condition of affairs in the lower Mississippi country are chargeable with the delay. As soon as this difficulty is overcome, a large force of men will be put at work and the fence will be erected with great speed.</p>
<p>That section of the grounds known as the Kountze tract will be enclose first. The work was started by one gang, at the southeast corner of this tract, at Sixteenth and Pinkney streets, and the posts are set along the west side of Sherman avenue to the north line of the Kountze ground. At the same time another gang of men started on the west end of this tract, at Twenty-fourth and Pinkney streets, and the posts are set along the Twenty-fourth street side of the ground. A number of posts are also set along the north line of this tract. The lumber has been distributed along where it will be needed and the work of putting the boards up will be commenced at once.</p>

<pb n="152" xml:id="TMISB02-152"/>



    <p>Unless the city council, at its next meeting, passes the ordinance now in the hands of a committee, which provides for the closing of Twentieth street between Pinkney street and Ames avenue, the work of grading the lakes and lagoons will be seriously interfered with. The system of lakes is designed to extend from one end of the Kountze tract to the other, or from Sixteenth to Twenty-fourth street. A wide excavation is contemplated where the lagoon intersects Twentieth street. Up to this time no action has bent ken in the direction of passing the necessary ordinance to enable the exposition authorities to fence up the street so that this work may be prosecuted. The ordinance was introduced about a month ago, and was referred to a committee, where it has since remained. Councilman Christie said this morning, in response to a question, that he would call out the ordinance up at the next meeting of the council and endeavor to have it passed. He said there was one question but that the ordinance would pass without any opposition.</p>
    <p>Until similar action is taken in the case of the ordinance authorizing the exposition authorities to fence up a part of Pinkney street between Sixteenth and Twenty-fourth streets, nothing can be done toward erecting the fence along the south side of the Kountze tract. It is necessary to set the south fence will out into the street in order that operations on the large buildings which will be erected along the south side of the grounds may be persecuted advantageously. Some of the residents along this street have protested against having this fence so close to them and the city council has taken no action in the matter. All of these matters are very annoying to the exposition authorities and unless prompt action is taken the delay may prove very expensive to the exposition.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">MAKING A TROCHA HERE.</head>
    <p>The trocha which will connect the Kountze tract with the large tract to the north will be a rather sinuous path. It was the desire of the exposition authorities at the outset to make this connection a broad avenue which might be parked to advantage and be a shady retreat where the weary might find a few moments' repose enroute from one section of the grounds to another. Efforts were made to secure options on the property between Nineteenth and Twenty-first streets in order that this might all be enclosed by the fence, but some of the property owners conceived the idea that an opportunity was offered them to speculate on the necessities of the exposition company, and a few of them made very unreasonable demands. These demands were not complied with, however, and for that reason the proposed broad avenue will be considerably narrower than was contemplated, and will be winding, instead of straight. Some of the owners of property desired to be used have made most liberal offers tot he exposition authorities. As an instance, one man volunteered to vacate his house and give the exposition authorities full control of hi property, the only condition being that the property shall be returned to him after the exposition is over in as good condition as when he surrendered it. As a result of this self-sacrifice, this man when he receives his property again, will find his yard beautifully parked with shrubbery and roses in profusion, and the house embellished and finished in a manner necessary to make it suitable for the purposes of the exposition. Another man told the exposition authorities to take a part of his lot and leave him just enough room to get out of his house. He is a prominent city official who has just completed a new house. The people who have held out against the inducements offered them by the exposition officers will find an eight-foot fence confronting them until after the exposition is over.</p></div3>
    <div3>
    <head type="sub">PROSPECT OF MANY BIDS</head>
    <p>The office of Superintendent Geraldine of the Department of Buildings and Grounds is the mecca of grading contractors and the indications are that a large number of bids will be submitted for doing the grading of the lakes and lagoons on the Kountze tract. This is the first large piece of work to be let this season and all the contractors are after it. The job will require the moving of about 80,000 cubic yards of earth. The haul will be rather short, as all the earth is to be "wasted" on the ground adjoining the canal.</p>
    <p>For the convince of contractors the work is divided into two sections. Section No. 1 is that portion of the Kountze tract lying east of the center line of Twentieth street, and section No. 2 is the portion lying west of that line. Bidders may bid upon one or both of these sections, accompanying bids upon section 1 by a certified check for $300 and by a check for $200 for bids upon section 2. Bidders are instructed that work must be commenced within ten days from the acceptance of propositions.</p>
    <p>These bids will be received at the office of the Department of Buildings and Grounds until 10 a. m. Saturday of this week and will be opened at the meeting of the executive committee, to be held at noon Saturday.</p></div3>

    <head type="sub">ROBERTS' BOND BILL PASSES.</head>
                <p>The next bill taken up by the clerk was house roll No. 578, to authorize Douglas county to vote $100,000 bonds in aid of the exposition. The clerk had scarcely finished reading the title before Gaylord jumped to his feet, and excitedly demanded to know by what authority the clerk had changed the order of these bill. This, he declared, had been done.</p>
                <p>Wooster reiterated all that had been said, and produced as evidence a memorandum of the bill numbers as he had taken theme hen reported by the engrossing committee.</p>
                <p>Clark of Lancaster said he did not wish to accuse any clerk of tampering with the record, and did not believe any such thing had been done.  He asked that the journal be produced and business proceed according to such record. After some further discussion this was done, and house roll No. 578 was read. After the emergency clause had been stricken out the bill passed by the following vote:</p>

<head type="sub">Governor Cannot Take Part in Exposition Jubilee <choice><sic>Execises.</sic><corr>Exercises.</corr></choice></head>
<p>President Wattles of the Transmississippi Exposition, who has charge of the inauguration jubilee on Arbor day, has received a reply from Governor Holcomb to the invitation sent him to deliver an address on the occasion. The governor expresses his regrets that he will not be able to accept the invitation and says he has already made arrangements to be absent from the state for about ten days and will not be in Nebraska on Arbor day. The governor suggests that, if it is thought necessary to have the state represented on that occasion, he will join in an invitation to Lieutenant Governor Harris to represent Nebraska at that time.</p>
<p>A rate of one and one-third fare on all railroads into Omaha will be available for all persons desiring to visit Omaha during the inauguration ceremonies on Arbor day. This results from the fact that the Nebraska Association of Local Fire Insurance Agents will be held in Omaha April 20 and 21, and a special rate has been made for that occasion by the railroads. This may be taken advantage of by all persons desiring to visit Omaha at that time.</p>
<p>All that will be necessary will be for a person coming to Omaha to buy a regular ticket from the agent, taking a certificate therefor, and present the certificate, on arrival in Omaha, to B. L. Baldwin, room 411 First National bank building, for endorsement, which will entitle the holder to a return ticket at one-third of the regular fare. Transportation will be good for the return trip up to and including April 24.</p></div2>

                <p>The exposition authorities will purchase five and one-half acres of land in the portion of the exposition grounds, known as the Kountze tract, and donate it to the city after the exposition, to be used as a park in connection with a piece of the same size immediately adjoining it, the whole to be known as Kountze park. These two pieces of ground lie on either side of Twentieth street and constitute the middle portion of the Kountze tract. The price to be paid for the ground by the exposition company is $15,000, but Mr. Kountze agrees to donate $5,000 of this amount to the exposition in the way of stock subscription.</p>
                <p>In consideration of this action the park commission has already agreed to expend $30,000 of the park fund upon this park in aid of the exposition.</p>
                <p>This action of the exposition association was decided upon at a meeting of the board of directors held last night. The matter was decided by motion of General Manderson, who offered a resolution providing that the proposition of Mr. Kountze should be accepted, and the land purchased, to be presented to the city after the close of the exposition.</p>
                <p>The only other business transacted by the board was the adoption of a motion instructing the executive committee to take such steps as may be necessary to collect the assessments on stock subscriptions which have not been paid.</p></div2>

                <p>The mystery surrounding the mysterious airship, which has caused the veracity of many reputable citizens to be questioned, promises to be cleared up within a few days through the medium of the Transmississippi Exposition. Either this is the fact or a stupendous hoax is to be perpetrated on the exposition authorities.</p>
                <p>In the first mail yesterday Secretary Wakefield received a letter dated at Omaha and bearing the postmarked of this date. The letter was signed, "A. C. Clinton" and read as follows:</p>
                <p>To the Exposition Directors: My identity up to date has been unknown, but I will come to the front now, i. e., if you guarantee me 870,000 square feet of space. I am the famous airship constructor and will guarantee you positively of this fact in a week. The airship is my own invention and as I am an Omaha man, I wish it to be held as an Omaha invention. It will carry safely twenty people to a height of from 10,000 to 20,000 feet. I truly believe I have the greatest invention and discovery ever made. Will see you April 17, 1897, at the headquarters.</p>
                <p>This communication was written on a sheet of plain note paper, without printed matter of any kind which would throw any light upon the identity of the writer. He gave no address and his name does not appear in the last city directory.</p>
                <p>The amount of space asked for by the writer of this letter is nearly thirty-five acres. The exposition authorities will await his appearance with interest.</p></div2>

                <p>The executive committee of the Transmississippi Exposition held its regular weekly meeting at the Commercial club rooms yesterday afternoon. Those present were: Chairman Lindsey and Messrs. Rosewater, Hitchcock, Bruce and Reed. Architect Kimball of the firm of Walker &amp; Kimball, supervising architects, was also present and the principal details regarding the general plan of the main buildings were discussed rather informally by the committee and the architect, but nothing definite was decided upon.</p>
                <p>Bids for grading the lakes and lagoons on the Kountze tract were received from the following parties: W. F. Callahan, Samuel Katz &amp; Co., O.

These were referred to the secretary to tabulate and report them back tot he meeting of the committee to be held Monday noon.</p>
                <p>Manager Reed of the Department of Concessions reported that he had received forty-six bona fide applications for space, aggregating 195,000 square feet. He said that this was a remarkably favorable showing as compared with other expositions.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the exposition executive committee yesterday afternoon bids were opened are read for the excavating and grading on the exposition grounds. It will be a job of about 80,000 square yards. The bids were from W. F. Callahan, Samuel Katz &amp; Co., Van Court &amp; Winn, Daniel Hanna, Ford &amp; Huse, C. A. Jensen &amp; Co., O. Nelson and P. H. Mahoney &amp; Co. The secretary and Superintendent Geraldine were instructed to tabulate the bids and report at a meeting to be held Monday.</p>
<p>Manager Reed of the department of concessions reported that the department had up to this time received forty-six bona fide applications for space covering 197,000 square feet. It was considered that this was beating the record for expositions, considering the time yet to elapse before opening the gates.</p>
<p>Supervising Architect Kimball gave to the committee some very general ideas with regard to the main points in the construction of the court buildings, and recommended architects for the principal ones. He thought that the height to the main cornice should be between thirty and forty feet, and that the width of the buildings should be 130 feet; that they should all be a collection of unites so that if extensions were found necessary the could be made at both ends and so not interfere with the symmetry of the structure, and he thought that the cornice line should be extended into a tie line that should appear in all the buildings. Another tie line would be that marked by the top of the colonnades. The sculpture limit for the height of a man he suggested should be from ten to twelve feet. he favors flat domes for all but the government building.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">AGRICULTURAL BUILDING.</head>
<p>He intimated that the agricultural building should cover one and a half acres, more than three times the size of the agricultural hall on the state fair grounds and twice as large as the corresponding building at the Atlanta exposition. The mines and mining building to be of the same size.</p>
<p>He said that no idea whatever could be conceived of the art building until something more definite was known as to how large an exhibit there would be and especially until a director of the fine arts exhibit was appointed. He <choice><sic>threfore</sic><corr>therefore</corr></choice> recommended that the appointment be made as soon as possible.</p>
<p>For the agricultural, the mines and mining, the manufactures and the horticultural buildings and for the auditorium Mr. Kimball recommended architects. All of them, save for the auditorium, are firms outside of Omaha, and at his suggestion he was authorized to enter into preliminary correspondence with the firms named for the agricultural, the miens and mining and the manufactures buildings. Designs for the art building and for the kiosks and minor buildings will, according to the sentiment of the architect and the committee, be secured by competition. The committee agreed with the Mr. Kimball that there was now not time to let the general work by competition, but the feeling of the committee was that competent local architects should have a fair share of the work.</p>
<p>Further than indicated, no action was taken on Mr. Kimball's recommendations.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">POMPEIIAN CITY.</head>
<p>It was stated that it was the idea of Mr. Walker to make the exposition as to decoration, not a "white city," but a Pompeiian city, and that the colonnades, which are to be an important and conspicuous feature from an artistic standpoint, should be highly and brilliantly colored.</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchcock of the department of promotion stated that the militia mobilization or encampment idea was growing. It was now thought that not only the militia of the states might be brought here, but the regular army as well. A bill has been introduced appropriating $5,000,000 for the mobilization of the regular army of the United States, the exact time and the place not being designated, and Mr. Hitchcock said that an effort would be made to get the bill amended providing that Omaha should be the place, and the summer of next year the time.</p>
<p>He gave figures showing how large has been the correspondence with officers of the National guard on the subject, and described the enthusiasm as being received by them.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">REGULAR MONTHLY MEETING.</head>
<p>in the absence of President Wattles, who is in St. Louis, Mr. Wells presided over the regular monthly meeting of the board of directors of the Trans-Mississippi exposition last night.</p>
<p>Herman Kountze and members of the committee that conferred with him in regard to the donation by him of ground to the city in connection with the exposition, stated that an agreement had been reached, and the subject was referred to the executive committee, with power to act.</p>
<p>The agreement is, as has already been published, that Mr. Kountze gives five and one-half acres east of  Twentieth street, and the city has the option of buying the five and one-half acres west of Twentieth street. The plan is that the exposition association buy this and give it to the city. It can get the ground for $15,000, and $5,000 will be turned back to the exposition association. This will make it possible for the park commission to expend the $30,000 available, and the eleven acres will afterward be maintained as Kountze park.</p>
<p>On motion of General Manderson, it was expressed as the sense of the directory that the purchase be made.</p>
<p>The executive committee was instructed to take steps to collect past due assessments.</p></div3></div2>

<head type="sub">BELIEVES THAT IT WILL BE A GREAT SHOW</head>
<head type="sub">General Manager Doddridge of the Missouri Pacific Says that His Road Will Help in a Financial Way.</head>
<p>"I have just looked over the plot of ground selected by the directors for the Transmississippi Exposition and think that no better site could have been picked out. It is convenient for the people, is splendidly located with reference to the entire city, is level and is altogether a sightly piece of ground," said W. B. Doddridge, general manager of the Missouri Pacific and Iron Mountain railway lines to a Bee reporter this morning.</p>
<p>General Manager Doddridge is in the city with a party of officials of that system. They spent the morning in looking over the ground set apart for the exposition. Mr. Doddridge appeared greatly interested in the success of the exposition> he said: "The exposition will prove a good thing for Omaha and this entire country. I hope it will be a great success. The subscription of our road will come along pretty soon."</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="main">OVERCOME THE OBJECTIONS</head>
<head type="sub">WORK AT EXPOSITION SITE TO PROCEED</head>
<head type="sub">Managers of the Big Show Do Not Anticipate Any Further Delay in the Temporary Closing of the Streets.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The passage of the ordinance closing a number of streets in the northern part of the city for the use of the Transmississippi Exposition is likely to be accomplished at the meeting of the city council this evening. Councilman Stuht, to whose committee the ordinance was referred, stated this morning that he would report the ordinance for passage tonight and would recommend that it pass.</p>
<p>This ordinance provides for the temporary closing of all the streets within the grounds to be used for the exposition, and its passage will allow the fence enclosing the grounds to be erected at once. Twentieth street, from Ames avenue to Pinkney street, is included in this ordinance. This is the only street in the Kountze tract. The contract for grading the lakes and lagoons on this tract has been hung up pending the action of the council on this ordinance.</p>
<p>The closing of a portion of Pinkney street is another matter which is delaying the erection of the fence about the exposition grounds. The occupants of the nine houses fronting on Pinkney street, between Sixteenth and Twenty-fourth streets, have entered a protest against the closing of a part of this street, but it has developed that this position of the residents on that street is due almost entirely to a misunderstanding on their part of what the exposition company proposes in this connection.</p>
<p>Councilman Stuht stated this morning that he had just learned what the exposition authorities intended to do with this street, and he said he was sure the residents would not object when they learned what is proposed. He sad he had talked with a few of theses people and they had at once withdrawn all objections when they learned the plan.</p>
<p>The exposition authorities desire to place the fence enclosing the grounds on the south curb line of Pinkney street. This will leave a space eighteen feet in width between the property line and the fence. The reason this space is wanted by the exposition management is to afford a street at the rear of the large main buildings, so that supplies may be hauled to the buildings, debris removed and as a means of ingress and egress will be improved by macadam or some other paving material, and when the fence is removed, the residents will have before them a paved street, placed there without expense to the property owners.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">MAY LOOK OVER THE FENCE.</head>
<p>More than this, the fence between the main buildings will be constructed of wire, in order to afford ventilation for the grounds, so that the residents along the street will be afforded a constant view of the interior of the main portion of the grounds&#8212;the portion which will be beautified with all the resources of the landscape artists' skill. In front of these wire openings will be planted shrubbery and trees, forming a screen to shut out the interior of the grounds from a full view of the outside, but the occupants of the adjoining houses may rise above this screen by looking from their upper windows and may obtain a view of the grand court at all times of the day or night without let or hindrance.</p>
<p>As expressed by Councilman Stuht, it is thought that all objections on the part of residents and property owners will be removed when these details are learned. Acting on this theory, Mr. Stuht will recommend to the council tonight that the ordinance temporarily closing the streets lying north of Pinckney street be amended by inserting a section to provide that Pinckney street may be closed from the south curb line to the north line of the street.</p>
<p>The action of the executive committee yesterday in assigning to the women's board the work of securing exhibits of women's work and assuming charge of this branch of the exposition proved rather a surprise to some of the members of the board.</p>
<p>At a meeting of the Board of Managers last week the only matter considered and the only matter which seemed to occur to the women in connection with the exposition was the educational exhibit and the holding of congresses on various subjects. No mention was made of any connection with women's work in general or in any other line than in connection with education. Therefore, when some of the women learned of the action of the executive committee in approving of the recommendation of Manager Bruce, that the women be given charge of women's work, they were rather nonplussed.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">CONSIDER THE NEW WORK.</head>
<p>The executive committee of the women's board will probably be called together some time this week to consider this new phase of the work, and it will then be determined whether it will be necessary to call a meeting of the entire board to grapple with this subject, or whether the executive committee will dispose of the matter by arranging a plan for this portion of the work.</p>
<p>The action of the executive committee of the exposition was taken under section 10 of the plan or organization for the Board of Mangers. This section is somewhat ambiguous and is capable of wide difference in construction, but is clearly in compliance with the construction placed upon it by the executive committee. This section is as follows: "That in the work of the various departments and committees of the Transmississippi and International Exposition, where the services of women would be valuable, that they be asked to render such service."</p>
<p>In this case they have been "asked to render such service" and the members of the women's executive committee say that they will not be found wanting. They say the women will take hold of the new line of work with determination and will at once perfect their plans for pushing the work with all possible speeds. They only regret that so much time has been lost in grasping the full scope of what is expected of them. </p></div3></div2>

    <head type="main">DEPARTMENT OF EXHIBITS</head>
<head type="sub">MANAGER BRUCE PERFECTING HIS WORK</head>
<head type="sub">Bids for Grading the Grounds Are Opened, but Contract is Not Awarded Because of Delay by the City Council.</head>
    <div3>
<p>At the meeting of the executive committee of the Transmississippi Exposition yesterday afternoon the Department of Exhibits, which is to form one of the most important departments of the great show, commenced to take on definite form. Manager Bruce, in charge of this department, has been giving the details of his department the most careful consideration since his election as a member of the executive committee, and the result of his deliberations was partially revealed at the meeting of the committee yesterday by a number of recommendations made by Mr. Bruce in connection with the detail work.</p>
<p>His first recommendation was that the control of the bureau of fine arts be given into the hands of the Western Art association of this city, the art association to be empowered, when the proper time comes, to employ a general superintendent, subject to the approval of the executive committee. The suggestion met with favor at the hands of the committee and was adopted.</p>
<p>At the suggestion of Mr. Bruce the salary of Mrs. Frances M. Ford, secretary of the Lady Board of Managers, was fixed for the present at $1,000 per year, with a temporary arrangement that she should be paid only for half time in order that she may devote a portion of her time to her private business.</p>
<p>Mr. Bruce also suggested that at some later time a space to be later agreed upon should be assigned to the women in the liberal arts section.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">TWO HONORARY APPOINTMENTS.</head>
<p>On the recommendation of Mr. Bruce, Prof. Owens of the Nebraska university was appointed honorary commissioner for the electrical section of the Department of Exhibits and W. K. Boardman of Des Moines was appointed honorary dairy commissioner for Iowa for the stock and dairy bureau.</p>
<p>The offer of the geological survey of the government to take charge of the exhibit of mines and mining was, on recommendation of Mr. Bruce, laid over for future consideration.</p>
<p>President McKinney and J. H. Moss, a committee from Carpenters' union No. 427, appeared before the executive committee to protest against the employment of men in building the fence around the exposition grounds for twenty cents per hour. The delegation claimed that the work of building a fence was carpenter work and insisted that men employed on that work should be paid twenty-five cents per hour.</p>
<p>In reply to questions by members of the executive committee the delegation said that the men now employed are receiving twenty cents per hour and are working ten hours; they asked that the men be given twenty-five cents per hour, and employed only eight hours.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WORK IS DISTRIBUTED.</head>
<p>They were informed by the committee that General Superintendent Geraldine, acting under the direction of the committee, had employed men living in Omaha, those with families being given the preference, and that these men were employed for a week or ten days and then laid off in order to give employment to another lot of men so that the money expended will go as far as possible in giving work to the greatest number.</p>
<p>The delegation approved this plan, but insisted that if the men were paid five cents more per hour and made to work shorter hours there would be more money expended and more men would be given work.</p>
<p>After the delegation had retired the matter was discussed by the executive committee and was referred to Mr. Geraldine.</p>
<p>The tabulation of the grading bids opened at the last meeting was taken up and it was found that Van Court &amp; Winn were the lowest bidders. They bid on both districts. On district No. 1, lying east of Twentieth street, they bid 9.7 cents per yard for completing the work in forty days, and 9.5 cents for completing it in sixty days. On district No. 2, lying east of Twentieth street, they bid 6.7 cents for either sixty or forty days.</p>
<p>No action was taken forward awarding the contract for this grading on account of the failure of the city council to pass the ordinance closing Twentieth street from Pinkney street to Ames avenue. Until this street is closed no work can be done in the way of grading.</p>
<p>The committee adjourned until Wednesday of this week to await the action of the city council tomorrow night. If the ordinance closing Twentieth street is passed, the contract for the grading will be let at once, but if the ordinance is not pass the work will be delayed until the council acts. The committee was greatly annoyed by this failure of the council to act, as every delay may prove expensive to the exposition.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WORK ON THE INAUGURAL PARADE.</head>
<p>The committee in charge of the inaugural parade for the exposition is gradually completing its plans, and will be ready in a few days to announce the details of the pageant.</p>
<p>The following organizations have signified their intention of taking part in the festivities: The Advertising Men's club, Fire and Police commission, Park board, Elks, Commercial club, Board of Education, Board of Governors, Masonic bodies and the city council. Other organizations which expect to participate in the parade are requested to notify the committee at once.</p>
<p>The committee invites everybody to take part in the parade, with instructions to trim their vehicles in any manner compatible with their ideas of decoration. All bands which will donate their services are urged to communicate with the committee, and those who do not with to donate are requested to state what terms they will make for that date. The same request is made to liverymen who will donate carriages for use of visitors in the city that day.</p>
<p>Major Wilcox has appointed G. B. Scrambling of the Thurston Rifles as an orderly to officiate with the committee till the parade and celebration have been disposed of.</p></div3></div2>

    <head type="sub">CARPENTERS NOW MAKE DEMANDS.</head>
<head type="sub">Insist that Union Men Only Shall Work on the Exposition.</head>
<p>The second chapter on the demands of the Carpenters' union on the Transmississippi Exposition was developed at the meeting of the executive committee yesterday afternoon. A letter was received from the committee which waited upon the executive committee at its meeting Monday afternoon. This letter was short and very sharp. It scored the executive committee for sustaining General Superintendent Geraldine in his contention that the building of a rough fence was not carpenter work. The letter denounced Mr. Geraldine as an enemy of union labor and demanded that none but union labor be employed, and that carpenters be paid 25 cents per hour.</p>
<p>The letter was placed on file and Mr. Hitchcock introduced a resolution providing that in the employment of carpenters on the exposition work they should be paid at the rate of 25 cents per hour. This was laid on the table to await a time when all the members of the committee should be present to act upon it.</p>
<p>President Wattles was authorized to procure a number of trees to be planted on the exposition grounds Arbor day at the inauguration ceremonies.</p>
<p>Manager Reed was authorized to make arrangements to issue an official program of the exercises on Arbor day.</p>
<p>Manager Lindsey was authorized to employ one or two collectors to collect the outstanding assessments on stock subscriptions.</p></div2>

    <p>One of The Bee's editorial paragraphs commenting on the declination of Governor Holcomb of the invitation to participate in the inaugural ceremonies of the Transmississippi Exposition seems to have done the governor an injustice.  The governor's letter in full in response to the invitation was as follows:</p>
    <p>EXECUTIVE CHAMBER, LINCOLN, April 8, 1897.&#8212;Messrs. G. W. Wattles and A. C. Smith, Omaha.&#8212;Gentlemen:  I have your highly appreciated favor of the 6th inst. inviting me to participate in the inaugural ceremonies of the Transmississippi and International Exposition.  I should have been very much pleased to have been present on this occasion, but prior to the receipt of your letter of invitation I had made arrangements for a brief vacation, which will take me out of the state for a week or ten days following the 19th inst.</p>
    <p>If it is deemed advantageous to the success of these ceremonies that the state should be represented on this occasion, I will gladly join you in a request to Lieutenant Governor Harris and have no doubt of his willingness to participate.</p>
    <p>Trusting that you will have an auspicious opening for the great exposition and regretting that I will not have the pleasure of being present, I am, yours truly,</p>
    <ab>SILAS A. HOLCOMB.</ab>
    <p>Governor Holcomb's interest in and devotion to the exposition has never been questioned, nor has his readiness to do everything in his power to promote its success been wanting at any time.</p>

The first is for the exhibit of a complete Indian school at the Transmississippi Exposition, with a manual training department in full operation as at the World's fair.  The second proposition to be urged upon the government officials is the establishment of a permanent Indian school on the site of Fort Omaha after the close of the exposition.

<p>WASHINGTON, April 17.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Congressman Mercer is interesting himself in exposition matters to a remarkable degree, and is letting nothing escape that will tend to increase the popularity of that big Omaha undertaking. he had a long interview with General Miles today in regard to the scheme of mobilizing the National Guard of various states at Omaha in 1898. General Miles expressed himself as being decidedly favourable to the proposition and informed Mr. Mercer that he would look into the matter immediately and ascertain the amount of money it would take to carry the plan to successful completion; that he thought the object praiseworthy, provided the troops could be taken care of in the Gate City, and whether there was ground enough adjacent to the exposition grounds to accommodate so large a body of citizen soldiery as would be present should the scheme be decided upon. General Miles has written General Coppinger of the Department of the Platte making inquiry along this line, and after the sought-for information has been obtained General Miles agrees to do all in his power to bring about the result. Congressman Mercer also visited Major Powell of the commissioner of Indian affairs office in reference to securing representatives of the several Indian tribes of the United States and Alaska for the Omaha Exposition.

<p>East on Farnam street from Twentieth street to Thirteenth, thence to Douglas, thence to Sixteenth, thence to Corby, thence to the exposition grounds.</p>
<p>The corner stone laid will be that of the arch of the states, which will form the main and south entrance to the grounds at Twentieth and Pinkney streets. A movement is now on foot to make the arch a permanent feature. Supervising Architect Kimball is in correspondence with stone furnishers, and thinks the prospect is good that they will bear the greater part if not all the expense of the construction of the arch. If made permanent, it would be a constant and magnificent souvenir of the exposition and would be an imposing ornament for the park which it is expected it will mark the center of. It is the plan after the exposition to put on its sides the seals of the thirteen original states and of all the remaining states of the union. </p>

It recited that the laboring men of the city had contributed to the fund of the exposition believing that it was an enterprise that would afford employment to a large part of their number, but complaint was made that resident laborers were being ignored, as proved by the statement of many who had investigated, and a demand was made that hereafter bona fide resident and union laborers be recognized first.</p>

    <head type="main">LAYING THE CORNERSTONE</head>
<head type="sub">EPOCH IN HISTORY OF THE EXPOSITION</head>
<head type="sub">Extensive Preparations Being Made for the Work that Will be Performed Next Thursday&#8212;Marks the Arch of States.</head>
<p>Preparations for the inauguration ceremonies of the Transmississippi Exposition are nearly completed and there is every indication that the affair will be one of the greatest demonstrations ever see in this city. Responses continue to be received from various organization, giving notice that they will take part in the parade. The latest notice of this kind was that received from the Merchants' and Manufacturers' association of Council Bluffs, stating that that organization would be in line with a large representation and would probably be accompanied by a band. It is estimated that there will be about 10,000 men in the parade.</p>
<p>The work of laying the foundation of the Arch of the States, the cornerstone of which will be laid on Arbor day, next Thursday, was commenced this morning. It is the desire of the exposition management to make this arch a permanent structure, and with this idea in view, Architect Kimball has been in correspondence with various manufacturers of brick and with owners of stone quarries with a view to having them construct the arch. One plan suggested is to build the arch of cream colored brick. it has been urged that this would form a beautiful contrast with the decorated frieze and result in a landmark which would be a thing of beauty. The plan of the arch, as agreed upon, contemplates having the frieze decorated with the coats of arms of the states of the union, done in colors, the transmississippi states being represented on the north and south sides, the thirteen original states on the east face of the frieze and the remaining states on the west face. The arch will then be what its name indicates&#8212;the Arch of the States. It will span Twentieth street at the south entrance to what will be known after the exposition as Kountze park, and will form a most striking landmark, visible in every direction. The design for this structure shows an arch on the order of the famous triumphal arches of European countries. It is massive and imposing in appearance and is a most pleasing architectural conception. Eastern papers have commented extensively and favorably on this arch, some of them printing sketches of it.</p>
<p>The cornerstone of this arch will be laid Arbor day by Grand Master Phelps of the Free Masons of Nebraska, assisted by the officers of the grand lodge. The ceremony will take place after the parade has reached the exposition grounds.</p>
<p>Van Court &amp; Winn, the contractors who will do the grading of the lakes and lagoons on the exposition grounds, have commenced moving their grading outfit to the grounds and expect to commence work the first of next week.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">Will Make it a Holiday.</head>
<p>The members of the parade committee of the Transmississippi Exposition have requested the retail stores to close tomorrow afternoon. Most of the proprietors have agreed to comply with the request and join in the exercises at the grounds. The wholesale houses and most of the railroad offices will close during the afternoon.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">PROMISES TO BE A GREAT PARADE.</head>
<head type="sub">Laying of Exposition Cornerstone Next Thursday.</head>
<p>The arrangements for the inauguration parade on Arbor day are about completed and there is every indication that the affair will be most successful in every respect. The parade bids fair to be an immense turnout and the exercises at the grounds will be of an entertaining character. in the even that the weather of today should be duplicated on Thursday the exercises will be held in one of the halls or theaters down town and the laying of the cornerstone will be dispensed with.</p>
<p>Governor Drake of Iowa notified President Wattles this morning that he had been called away on important official business and would be unable to attend the inauguration exercises.</p>
<p>Nothing definite <choice><sic>reagrding</sic><corr>regarding</corr></choice> the presence of W. J. Bryan has yet been received. His secretary wrote that Mr. Bryan would probably return to Nebraska on March 19 (today) and in that event would be present at the inauguration ceremony.</p>
<p>The parade will start promptly on time and all organizations desiring to take part have been notified to be in line not later than 1 o'clock.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">EXPOSITION WORK TAKEN UP IN EARNEST</head>
<head type="sub">Executive Committee of the Board of Lady Managers Holds its First Formal Session and Selects Permanent Officers.</head>
<p>The executive committee of the Board of Lady Managers of the Transmississippi Exposition met at noon today for the first time in the rooms assigned for its use in 632 and 633 of the Paxton block. The rooms have been furnished with a handsome curtain top desk and directory table, both of antique oak, while Mrs. Frances Mumagh has volunteered to adorn the walls with paintings from her own brush. One large painting, representing a handsome bouquet of roses elegantly framed in heavy gold mouldings, was already in position on the east wall and others will be added as soon as possible. A handsome vase filled with cut flowers ornamented the large directory table in the center of the room. Comfortable chairs were supplied for the members and an air of cheerfulness pervaded the new rooms despite the heavy rain which beat incessantly against the windows.</p>
<p>All of the members of the committee elected at the general meeting on April 7 were present, the first meeting being fully attended. Those present were: Mrs. Sawyer of Lincoln, Mrs. Reed of Council Bluffs, Mrs. Kimball, Mrs. Keysor, Mrs. Harford and Miss Kate McHugh of Omaha. Mrs. Ford occupied the secretary's desk by virtue of her office. Mrs. Keysor, chairman of a committee appointed to prepare rules for the government of the executive committee, presented her report and the rules were adopted without material amendment. Under these rules the executive committee will be officered by a permanent chairman and vice chairman, the secretary of the board to officiate as clerk at all meetings. Meeting of the committee are to be held on the first and third Saturdays of each month, but special meetings may be called oftener by the chairman.</p>
<p>Nominations for the permanent officers were then called for. Mrs. Reed promptly nominated Mrs. Harford for permanent chairman and the nomination was seconded by Miss McHugh. Mrs. Harford stated that under the circumstances she would like to have other names presented, and therefore Mrs. Sawyer nominated Mrs. Reed. This nomination was also seconded. Then both candidates entered modest disclaimers of any ambition to occupy the chairmanship, and after a mutual exchange of compliments Mrs. Harford nominated Mrs. Kimball for the place. More mutual compliments followed and a ballot was taken. Mrs. Harford received four votes, Mrs. Reed two and Mrs. Kimball one. Mrs. Harford was declared elected by the secretary, who had canvassed the votes. Mrs. Harford thanked the committee in a  few well chosen words. No names were presented for the vice chairmanship, but by common consent a ballot was taken without the formality of nominations. The ballots counted out five for Mrs. Reed and two for Mrs. Keysor, and the former <unclear reason="cut off"></unclear></p>
<p>The remaining moments intervening between the election of the officers and the luncheon hour were filled with informal talk over the relations of the committee to the work of the exposition. The more serious part of the day's work was postponed until after luncheon, when Mr. Bruce, chief of the bureau of exhibits, was to be present for a preliminary conference. At 1 o'clock the committee repaired to the rooms of the Young Women's Christian Association in the Bee building, where luncheon was served.</p></div2>

<p>A. Hospe, jr., who was slated as marshal of the second division, telegraphed Major Wilcox this morning that he is detained in Carthage, O., at the bedside of his sick father and would not be in Omaha tomorrow. Dr. R. M. Stone was therefore appointed as marshal of the second division.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">BOARD OF LADY MANAGERS MEET.</head>
<head type="sub">Scope of the Bureau is Clearly Defined.</head>
<p>Yesterday afternoon's session of the Board of Lady Managers of the exposition was given up entirely to an informal discussion of the work before the committee, no definite details being worked out. Mr. Bruce, manager of the Department of Exhibits, was present for a while and was kept busy answering a running fire of questions, all pertinent. He explained that the department or division to be managed by the women was the first to be organized. It had been allotted one fourth of the space in the Liberal Arts building and would be expected to fill every inch <choice><sic>or</sic><corr>of</corr></choice> it. Not only were the educational exhibits to be turned over to the women but several additional features would be added to their department. It was not the purpose or the desire of the managers of the exposition, explained Mr. Bruce, to have a distinctively woman's exhibit. In all departments where the work of women came in competition with the work of men the two exhibits would stand side by side. For instance: Examples of ornamental wood carving executed by a woman would take its place beside similar work from the hands of a man, and the public would be required to compare the two. This feature gave general satisfaction to the members of the committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Bruce further explained that the managers of the exposition purposed to treat the women's board as the equal of other boards connected with the enterprise. The managers desired the women to feel that they were not acting merely in an auxiliary capacity, but that their assistance was desired on the grounds that their interest, their enthusiasm and their executive ability would contribute much to the success of the exposition.</p>
<p>After Mr. Bruce had retired the members of the committee express themselves as well pleased with the interview. They all agreed that they had a clearer idea of the work expected of them and by a unanimous vote they agreed to accept the extra work placed upon their department.</p>
<p>The chief clerk of the Bureau of Promotion, E. C. Hunt, was called on the carpet and asked a great many questions concerning the proposal to secure for the exposition a number of congresses intimately connected with educational work. He answered as many of the questions as he could, but added that the bureau with which he was connected had as yet given this branch of the work little thought. The Commercial club, he added, had entered actively upon the work of securing for Omaha the meetings of many national organizations and he suggested that the women's board consult Mr. Utt, secretary of that organization. Mrs. Secretary Ford was directed to communicate with Mr. Utt and secure his views as to the best course to proceed.</p>
<p>Several matters of correspondence were presented by the secretary and she was directed to answer the accumulated letters. All committees heretofore appointed were requested to present either verbal or written reports at the first meeting in May. The secretary was also requested to open up correspondence with the Federation of Women's Clubs in all the Transmississippi</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Inauguration of Preparations to Construct the Arch of States is Made a Gala Day in Omaha.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The inauguration ceremonies of the Transmississippi and International Exposition were held under the most favorable auspices and the whole affair, from start to finish, was marked by a smoothness and success which boded well for the success of the great event of which it formed the beginning.</p>
<p>The weather was all that could have been desired. The drenching rain of last night purified the atmosphere, while the penetrating rays of the bright sun dried up the mun and warmed the air with a balmy radiance which penetrated to the cockles of the most obdurate heart.</p>
<p>The brightness of the weather had a most exhilarating effect upon the citizens of Omaha and the surrounding country. The streets were filled with people at an early hour and the whole town took on a holiday appearance. A multitude of flags floated from the buildings in all parts of the city and bunting in the national colors was thrown to the air from business and residences. All of the railroad offices and wholesale houses and nearly all of the retail stores closed their doors at noon, the attaches improving the opportunity to join in the general jubilation which marked the entire day as being one of more than ordinary importance. The public schools were closed in honor of the occasion and the children added to the throng.</p>
<p>As though by preconcerted arrangement no attempt had been made to have any Arbor Day exercises anywhere but on the exposition grounds, and everybody seemed anxious to participate in the program which was to mark the actual beginning of the work on the exposition. The streets leading to the northern portion of the city were filled with people long before noon, all making their way to the place where the exercises were to be held. Men, women and children were decked in holiday colors and evidences of a gala day were visible everywhere.</p>
<p>At 1 o'clock the streets down town were filled with numerous organizations making their way to the rendezvous for the parade. Farnam street, between Sixteenth and Twentieth, presented a brilliant scene. The large number of bands marched and counter-marched, playing the while, the air being filled with the confusion of sweet sounds, and the military and civic societies moved to their places in the line.</p>
<p>The parade was a trifle late in starting, but the best of order was observed, and when Grand Marshal Wilcox gave the command to march the great procession moved off with imposing effect. As the rear of the first division passed the point where the second division was formed the latter fell in line, and when all had taken their places in the long line the procession was a most imposing one. The military and civic societies were intermingled in such a way as to take away the general stiffness which characterizes public parades and the flying banners of the soldiers and the numerous secret societies combined to produce a gala day appearance.</p>
<p>All along the line of march, from the business districts to the grounds, the streets were lined with people on foot, in carriages and on horseback, with bicyclists in large number.</p>
<p>The procession followed the line of march as previously announced, accompanied by enthusiasm and cheers of the onlookers.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">CORNERSTONE OF THE ARCH.</head>
<p>When the procession reached the exposition grounds the line was formed in open order and the Masonic grand lodge marched between the long lines to the platform where the exercises were to take place. The other Masonic bodies followed the grand lodge and then the crowd filled the space about the stand until the entire vicinity was packed with a surging mass of upturned faces.</p>

<p>Grand Master Phelps raised his hand for silence and briefly stated the purpose for which the gathering had assembled. The Twenty-second United States Infantry band played a selection and the grand chaplain invoked a divine blessing upon the exercises.</p>
<p>Grand Treasurer Hartman stepped forward with the sealed box which was to be deposited in the niche prepared for it in the cornerstone. He also produced a long list of the articles which had been deposited in the box before it had been sealed. The list contained a great variety of articles for the information of future generations and the reading of it occupied several minutes. The list was as follows:</p>
<p>Last proceedings of the grand lodge, grand chapter and grand commander of Nebraska; souvenir of Omaha issued by the Board of Trade; report of Board of Park Commissioners; list of officers of Western Union Telegraph company; report of Transmississippi and International exposition association, with list of officers and photographs of officers, including Board of Lady Managers; one copy of each of the daily papers o Omaha; a list of the present city officers and newly elected officers; photograph of Mrs. R. C. Clowry, one of Omaha's noblest daughters; report of county commissioners and county officers; copy of the plans and diagram of the exposition grounds; photographs of numerous buildings; street scenes in Omaha; photographs of Judge James W. Savage, General Experience Estabrook, Hon. A. J. Poppleton, John A. Creighton, Dr. George L. Miller, Hon. John M Thurston, Hugh G. Clark, T. L. Kimball, all the judges of the district court, General Superintendent Dion Geraldine, President McKinley, Vice President Hobart, W. J. Bryan, A. Sewall, Lininger's art gallery, Bee building, Young Men's Christian association building, Board of Trade building, Union Pacific bridge, South Omaha stock yards and packing houses, all the public schools; names of members of legislatures of transmississippi states; copy of exposition number of The Bee; copy of proceedings of Transmississippi congress at Omaha; official program of today's exercises; articles of incorporation of exposition, blank form of application for space, blank subscription form, records of proceedings of Tangier temple and photographs of officers.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">MASONIC EXERCISES HELD.</head>
<p>After reading the list the grand treasurer deposited the sealed copper box in the niche in the stone and the massive stone was lowered to its resting place. The inscription on the stone was in full view of the crowd and was as follows: "Laid by the Masonic Fraternity, April 22, 1897, M. W., Charles J. Phelps, G. M."</p>
<p>When the stone had been lowered the grand master handed to Deputy Grand Master J. B. Dinsmore the square, to Grand Senior Warden F. H. Young the <choice><sic>lvel</sic><corr>level</corr></choice> and the grand junior warden the plumb. These officers applied their instruments to the stone, and each in turn reported to the grand master that the stone was found to be properly cut and laid.</p>
<p>The deputy grand master then took a golden vessel containing corn from Egypt, procured especially for this purpose, and scattered the corn liberally over the stone, explaining that this corn was emblematic of plenty.</p>
<p>The grand senior warden poured from a silver vessel wine brought from Jerusalem by Hon. G. W. Lininger, proclaiming it an emblem of joy and gladness.</p>
<p>The grand junior warden poured over the stone oil from Jerusalem, emblematic of peace.</p>
<p>The grand master delivered a short but feeling invocation asking the divine blessing upon the building to be reared upon this foundation. The grand master struck the stone three times with the gavel and the grand honors were given by the surrounding brethren, after which the grand master delivered to Supervising Architect T. R. Kimball the implements of his profession, exhorting him to supervise the construction of the building.</p>
<p>The grand master then publicly announced that the stone had been laid in due form.</p>
<p>Following these exercises the speakers were introduced by President G. W. Wattles of the exposition association, the first one being Mayor Broatch. He spoke as follows:</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">THE MAYOR TALKS.</head>
<p>Perhaps the pleasantest duty which the mayor is called upon to perform is the welcoming to our city those who honor us with a visit. It gives me pleasure upon this auspicious occasion to extend to you the heartiest greeting of the city of Omaha, a city beautifully situated in the midst of fertile valleys and bordered on every side by rich, rolling prairies; watered by the Missouri and its <choice><sic>tributatries</sic><corr>tributaries</corr></choice>&#8212;a stream which perpetually flows and is supplied by the melting snows of the Rocky mountains, thus furnishing a constant supply of that pure elixir which is among God's best gifts.</p>
<p>Omaha is a city of great expectations&#8212;expectations based upon something substantial, expectations which e confidently assert are reasonable and will be realized. With the great agricultural resources at our command and the undeveloped manufacturers which may be said to be indigenous to the soil, we have the elements which, if happily employed, will give employment to thousand and support a dense population. In common with our sister cities, and, indeed, the whole country, we have experienced a period of privation and distress, from which we are now emerging. We have been taught many lessons in frugality; we have eaten the bread of poverty, but we are still alive and endowed with those God-given facilities which, properly applied, will enable us to eclipse our fondest dreams.</p>
<p>The essentials of success are energy, industry and wisdom, and these our people possess. When the present enterprise was first conceived it was regarded doubtfully, and the magnitude of the undertaking appalled them; but with a clear understanding and the example of the confidence and courage of President Wattles and his associates, nothing seemed too great or too good for Omaha. Our people responded to the call for subscriptions, and nearly $500,000 was soon guaranteed, an exhibition of their confidence in the project. Tho those of our fellow citizens who had the genius to conceive and the ability to plan this enterprise we owe more than we can well repay. They have devoted many days unselfishly and gratuitously to the public interest; they have brought to bear rich experience of many years of a successful business life; they have given of their means as well. When the time comes let the public show its appreciation and let it not be said, as it is too often the case, that it is ungrateful and fails to acknowledge the services of a faithful public servant.</p>
<p>It is proposed to make this exposition attractive to people of all climes and nationalities; it is intended to make it a school of instruction, as well as  a place for amusement; it is intended to enlighten our friends upon the eastern shores of this continent as to our education, our refinement, our capabilities and our resources, in the not vain hope that many of them may find it to their interest to leave their congested cities and seek a home in our beautiful and productive Nebraska. I thank you for your attention and to you who are visitors to our city I acknowledge the courtesy of your presence and pray you to come again, and again bespeaking for you the kind and considerate attention of our people.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">SPEAKS FOR NEBRASKA.</head>
<p>Lieutenant Governor Harris of Nebraska, after being introduced, spoke as follows:</p>
<p>In the absence from the state of the beloved chief executive, Governor Holcomb, the duty of representing the state in the inauguration exercises of the Transmississippi Exposition has been assigned to me. The feeling of regret felt by the managers of the exposition is shared in by him who represents him, as well as by the people of the whole state.</p>
<p>His words of encouragement, his wise council, will be missed in your exercises today. The exposition will mean much to the people Nebraska, much to the people in the transmississippi states. Our people in the west are not known, not understood, by the people of the east. To them we are in the "wild and woolly west," our manners uncouth, our garments are supposed to be of the cowboy pattern, our artificial light the dim candles of our grandmothers, our schools few, our teachers incompetent, our state devoid of substantial improvements the home of the jack rabbit, the coyote and a semi-civilized people. Such are the conceptions of many good people who will visit the exposition.</p>
<p>And what will they find when they come? The richest soil in the world, a veritable garden spot, where God has given in great abundance the conditions of the soil, climate and moisture to feed and bless its people. They will find a sunny land, with as many beautiful days throughout the year as any country on earth. Her citizens provided with every modern improvements, electric lights, street railways as good as the best, churches, schools, theaters, libraries, challenging comparison with the cities of any state or nation.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">STORY OF ENERGY.</head>
<p>They will find the prairies dotted over with comfortable farm houses, orchards and groves. The fields of grain, the herds of cattle and swine, feeding on the succulent grasses, the vast areas in alfalfa and other tame grasses, more eloquently then words tell the story of the energy, thrift and progressive spirit of the Nebraska farmer.</p>
<p>They will find the lowest per cent of illiteracy of any state of our great nation of states. The liberties of a nation depend not on a high standard of intelligence for the few, but the intelligence of the many. Judged by this standard Nebraska may well hold up her head proudly in the sisterhood of states.</p>
<p>They will find a magnificent system of schools supported by the state. The State university, with a faculty of 150 professors and instructors, some of whom have a world-wide reputation in their chosen fields of work, opening its doors free to the world in all its various departments, training and fitting our young men and women for professional life or any station where cultured minds and hearts are needed. The State Normal fully equipped to prepare the teacher for his work; the common schools&#8212;the bulwark of liberty&#8212;the hope and pride of the nation, the citizen's college, where more than elsewhere, save in the home, the principles of morality, of citizenship, of love of country, are taught.</p>
<p>God bless our common schools, the safeguards of liberty, and their faithful teachers standing as watchmen at the portals of liberty, silently, perhaps unconsciously, guarding and guiding the forces of a nation's power. These educational forces are supplemented by our High school system and more than thirty private schools and colleges.</p>
<p>They will find our people with that quickened sense of sympathy and responsibility&#8212;the birthright of our civilization&#8212;have made ample and generous provisions for the afflicted and suffering, the old soldier who fought for the flag, the deaf, the blind, the insane have homes provided by the state.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">VALUE OF EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>When the gates of the exposition are open for visitors the people of Nebraska will extend the hand of welcome and good fellowship to their brothers and sister of other states. Cheap transportation will enable our friends to gaze upon our broad fields of waving grains, our beautiful inland cities, our public buildings and to get acquainted with our people.</p>
<p>Industry, integrity, a high standard of moral obligations, are not only essential to success in the business world, but will ever be the essential standard by which a state or nation is judged. Measured by this standard, Nebraska will challenge comparison with her sister states in her willingness and her ability to make good her pledges.</p>
<p>To our own state the exposition will be valuable. Incentives are needed, that the best results may be attained. We can only judge by comparisons. If Nebraska can produce the best it can only be known when its products are placed beside the products from other states. The effort to produce the best will repay our cost in the exposition. The best seed to be found will be planted and the best cultivation possible will be given. The results will be far-reaching in the future. The Nebraska farmer will raise the standard of farming and increase the value of his farm, too. The same will be true in the workshop, the factory, the school, and in every branch of industry. The standard of excellence will be raised in every calling, in every business. An era of <choice><sic>incention</sic><corr>invention</corr></choice> probably follows or precedes all the great expositions. Human ingenuity is taxed and stimulated, the mind calls out it latent powers and the world reaps the benefits. Nebraska produces a surplus which must be sold. The quality of a given product is one condition in fixing the price. If we can produce the best we add to the market value of our products. The very best we can produce should be exhibited, if we profit as we should, in the exhibits.</p>
<p>It will advertise us. Nebraska must be known to be appreciated. In the councils of party statesmanship she furnishes the presiding officers to the political parties. In presidential candidates she is in the majority and will probably be yet heard from. In the galaxy of statesmen she points with pride to her sons in congress and in the United States senate. No start placed on our banner shines with more splendor than hers.</p>
<p>The wisdom of the managers of the Trans-mississippi Exposition will see that her luster is not paled. Speaking for the whole states we congratulate the managers for the work begun, the purposes in view, and confidently entrust the work to their hands, believing that Nebraska's sons can carry the work to success.</p></div3>

<head type="sub">WORK OF THE PIONEERS.</head> 
        <note type="citation">Special Day</note>
<p>Hon. J. Sterling Morton, ex-secretary of agriculture, upon being introduced, said:</p>
<p>In the wisdom of His creative majesty the great Mysteriarch of the Universe surrounded man with mysteries. Without such environment there would have been no incentive to thought, no inducement to investigation. The life and growth of a blade of grass, the development of a rose, or the evolution of a great oak from an acorn alike suggest the unknown, the miraculous and the unsolved.</p>
<p>In 1854 the pioneers of Nebraska made the first lodgment of modern civilization upon the vast, undulating ocean of fertile lands which stretched in solitude from the west bank of the Missouri river toward the Rocky mountains.</p>
<p>At the point of the plow they have compelled the prairies of Nebraska to deliver up, during the last forty-one years, thirty-six abundant crops, some of them almost miraculous in yield. During that period of time, in remote frontier portions of the commonwealth, there have been some failures, or partial failures, of crops from drouth and from grasshoppers. But in the eastern section of Nebraska there may be found hundreds of farms which since 1855 have never once failed to remunerate intelligent tillage with substantial rewards. The men who legitimately, steadfastly and discreetly have trusted tot he plow and intelligent farming nit he first settled sections of Nebraska since 1885 are, as at rule, successful men, not mortgaged nor in financial straits. There is no part of the United States which can exhibit from its first cultivation a crop record equal in annual yield to that which eastern Nebraska is proud to exhibit from the day when agriculture first put its autograph on the prairie with the point of the plow, down to the autumn of 1896, when the sun shone and the winds played among the cornfields in this commonwealth, which produced more than 200,000,000 of bushels. Nebraska is prepared with statistics, figures and facts to prove that during the last forty years no state in the union has surpassed it in the regularity and abundance of its crops. Thus far, however, we have only demonstrated that the elements of plant life and growth, which were primarily absorbed by the wild grasses and flowers, are now appropriated and utilized by corn, oats, barley, rye, wheat and a variety of root and other food crops. The summer and autumn sunlight which formerly only bronzed prairie grass now gilds the grain fields, burnishes ripening fruit and matures ample rewards in varied products for intelligent toil.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">HISTORY OF ARBOR DAY.</head>
<p>But after the demonstration of the plow as to the fertility of Nebraska another problem demanded solution. The home builders in this new country desired the embellishment of the plains by woodlands and forests, and the question as to how it should be accomplished and as to whether forests would thrive in these soils compelled earnest and analytical investigation. Consequently, after much experimentation, much of individual exhortation and effort, there was evolved out of the shadeless plains and from the utter desolation of treelessness, a plan for unanimous tree planting on a given day by all the people in all the counties of all of the commonwealth. And the plan took root like a strong and valuable tree. Its growth today reaches out into all of the states of the American republic. It has been grafted upon the school system of the entire country. It has been transported to European countries, which are carefully cherishing it. in Mexico, Australia and in some of the far-away islands of the oceans and seas it is permanently established as an anniversary and everywhere it is recognized and welcomed as a child of Nebraska.</p>
<p>In all of the timbered states of the east, and in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, in fact in each of the heavily wooded section of the United States, vast areas of trees were unnecessarily cut down and the logs, even of valuable oaks, walnuts and other cabinet woods, thoughtlessly, uselessly transmuted

<pb n="160" xml:id="TMISB02-160"/>



to smoke and ashes. How few of the ax-men, the tree slayers, who kindled those disastrous conflagrations realized that the flames which they evolved were merely stolen sunlight set free, enfranchised. The mystery of the life of a great and aged tree is a majesty compared to which that of human royalty is tame, puerile and insignificant. From our earliest childhood we are taught that fire and water will not mix, but in the tree they mingle as friends and co-laborers. With its foliage, which are its lungs, the tree breathes in the rain and the light. Every sunbeam which it inhales is imprisoned only to be freed again by combustion. The water and the fire are married and dwell inter-dependently in all the vegetable kingdom.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">DESTRUCTION OF FORESTS.</head>
<p>Like vast, disciplined armies the forests of the American continent stood guard over the fertility of the lands and the health and lives of all the animal creation which they protected. With their foliage of emerald and the whispering winds, those great stretches of wooded land lured the light of the sun, the moisture of the clouds to their hearts and made them hostages, pledges against flood, drouth and the disease which those calamities create. But man's wanton wastefulness of the superb woods of the United States has dried up thousands of springs of delicious drinking water, parched out beautiful brooks and useful mill streams, destroyed the plaint and absorbing leaf-mould of the forest, which was the arrester and custodian of torrential rainfalls and the mother of rills and streams.</p>
<p>It is possible that each stratum of rocks and minerals is a grave, a great tomb, wherein myriads of centuries ago were buried the remnants of animal and vegetable kind? When woodlands, forest trees shall have all been destroyed, together with subsidiary vegetation, every living thing will have perished from the face of the earth. Has this globe at some time in the unknowable, pre-historic past subsisted a race which destroyed its forest and then, as a penalty, perished? Is the present tenantry of this earth destined to destroy all its forests and trees and thus commit universal suicide? The intermission of the foliage, flower, and fruit of a single summer would bring upon every human being, upon all animals organisms, an overwhelming avalanche of death. This is a stupendous truth. It admonishes mankind that their physical and sanitary protection is in the trees and forests, which conserve the rainfall, mitigate the heat of the sun and make possible the continuation of animal life and the perpetuation of that civilization which exalts and ennobles the human race. </p>
<p>A truth and a tree outlive generations of men. That this admirably planned Transmississippi Exposition may plant truths as to the economic and material resources of its vast and <choice><sic>oppulent</sic><corr>opulent</corr></choice> empire in the minds of the tens of thousands of intelligent visitors and sojourners who may attend it, with as cheerful a certainty and a serene a satisfaction as we experience in planting these trees in the never deceiving, never-disappointing soil of the fertile Nebraska, is my earnest hope and my sincere and intense desire.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">WORKING AT EXPOSITION GROUNDS.</head>
<head type="sub">Contractor Promises to Begin Grading Tomorrow Morning.</head>
<p>Van Court &amp; Winn, the contractors for the grading of the lagoon on the Kountze tract, have been delayed in commencing grading operations, but expect to get started tomorrow morning. They have moved their grading outfit to the exposition grounds and their men are busy putting up the stables and other buildings which constitute a graders' camp. One of their grading machines is on the ground and the rest of the material will be in place by this evening. The ground has been staked for grading and the work is ready to move with a rush.</p>
<p>The exposition ground is the mecca for large numbers of laboring men and mechanics and the men who are at work are the center of the envious eyes of dozens of men who are waiting for a chance to go to work. The camp of the graders and the gangs of men building fence form the centers of these groups. The grading contractor and the foremen of the other gangs are besieged every morning by eager applicants for work. As yet but a small number of men are employed, as the nature of the work does not require a large force, but the time is close at hand when the necessity for haste will require the employment of large numbers of men in all lines of work.</p>
<p>As the work of erecting the fence surrounding the grounds progresses the large limits of the grounds goes <choice><sic>,dsfpt........</sic></choice> extent of territory enclosed within the increased force. The Kountze tract and the large tract lying to the north of it, including the old fair grounds and Oak Chatham addition, are half a mile in length from east to west. The tract lying east of Sherman avenue is about half a mile in length from north to south. Five miles of fence are required to enclose the grounds and the task of walking over the whole is no small one.</p>
<p>The old sheds which have disfigured the fair grounds for many years are being torn down. They will all be removed, including the grand stand, to make way for the palatial buildings in which will be housed the diversified exhibits of the exposition. This north tract will be devoted to the agricultural exhibits, the live stock and irrigation displays and a portion of the ground will be set apart for athletic sports of all kinds. Here will be irrigated farms on a small scale, and the lovers of live stock will be afford ample opportunity to gratify their taste.  This portion of the ground extends as far north as Ames avenue.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">DEMANDS OF PROPERTY OWNERS.</head>
<head type="sub">Plan to Secure Passes from Exposition Management.</head>
<p>A slight difficulty has been encountered with the people living along the west side of Twentieth street, between the Kountze tract and Oak Chatham addition. A few of the people living along the west side of the street refused to consider any kind of a reasonable proposition from the exposition management for the use of their property for exposition purposes.</p>
<p>When Twentieth street was closed by action of the city authorities this action vacated the street between the lot lines on either side. The exposition management, however, not desiring to fence the people in, decided to place the fence along the curb line, thus giving the residents along the street plenty of room for pedestrians. This did not suit them and they at once employed a lawyer, who notified the exposition authorities that if the fence was erected along the curb line his clients would at once tear it down. He was reminded that the exposition management had full authority to place the fence on the property line if they so desired. He reiterated his threat and said his clients would not consent to the fence being erected unless each of them was furnished with a pass into the exposition grounds for his whole family from now until the exposition is over, and were also given the privilege of crossing the exposition grounds at all times in order to reach Sherman avenue. Up to date this very modest proposition has not been accepted. The exposition authorities offered to grade the alley back of these lots and arrange suitable exits for the residents, but they declared that their ultimatum had gone forth. For the present the matter is in statu quo.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">POSITION OF THE NORTH SIDERS.</head>
<head type="sub">Twentieth Street Lot Owners Not Asking for Passes to Exposition.</head>
<p>George Eddy, one of the residents on North Twentieth street in the vicinity of the exposition grounds, said this morning that he had no objection to having the fence along the curb line and thought the other residents felt the same way regarding the matter. He said he would object to having a high fence along his property line and thought such a move would be orally wrong. But he ridiculed the idea that any of the people along that street wanted to take any undue advantages of the exposition management be asking for passes to the show. He said that some of the people living along that street who work in the Missouri Pacific round house would be required to go a long distance around the grounds unless they were allowed to cross them while the work of construction is in progress, and this was the only request they had to make.</p>
<p>Another complication has arisen in connection with the erection of the fence along Twentieth street. When the surveyors employed by the exposition authorities run their liens along Twentieth street it was discovered that the lot lines of the property abutting on the west side of the street were six feet over the street line, the error having been made in the original platting of this addition. Some of the residents have moved their fences back to the proper line, but otherwise nothing has been done in the matter.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">Paying Exposition Assessments.</head>
<p>Two collectors, D. G. Rhoads and W. W. Copeland, have been employed by Manager Lindsey of the Department of ways and Means to collect assessments on stock subscriptions. They are making preparations to call upon subscribers who have not paid the four assessments of 5 per cent each which have been levied upon all stock. The exposition management desires tat subscribers be prepared to make payments to the collectors when they call, as there are so many subscribers that it will be difficult for the collectors to call more than once. Remittances continue to be received by mail, and the amount of these remittances and of the collections so far made by the collectors has been very gratifying to the officials.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">WORK STARTS ON EXPOSITION GROUNDS</head>
<head type="sub">Large Force of Men Now Employed in Excavating for the Lakes and Planting Trees and Foliage.</head>
<p>The work of grading the lakes and lagoons on the Kountze tract of the exposition grounds was started in earnest this afternoon. A small showing at grading was made Tuesday afternoon, but the rain of yesterday interfered with the continuation of the work at that time. This afternoon a grading machine and six wagons were started at work and another machine will be put on the work within a day or two, also several more wagons.</p>
<p>The work was started on the lower portion of the Kountze tract lying west of Twentieth street and the earth is being "wasted" on the depressions around the sides of this part of the grounds. All of the earth removed in the making of these excavations will be used on the ground to bring the entire tract to a uniform level and avoid having the buildings placed in depressions.</p>
<p>A number of people witnessed the beginning of active work on the grounds, among them being several prominent citizens, and the scene was one of considerable activity. This contract covers the removal of about 80,000 yards of earth, and the contractor is under bonds to complete the work within forty days.</p>
<p>Besides the men employed by the grading contractor a number of men are employed on the ground sin setting out the trees which are being placed along the fence. These trees will surround the entire section known as the Kountze tract, being placed as near the fence as may be. Among them are Lombardy poplars about twenty feet in height. All are young and healthy trees and present a handsome appearances. on the tract lying east of Sherman <choice><sic>anvenue</sic><corr>avenue</corr></choice> cedars and other ornamental trees, as well as a large number of shrubs, are being planted, in preparation for the parking of this portion of the ground. The time for planting trees is nearly over, and the work is being pushed with all possible speed in order to insure a sure growth.</p>
<p>In addition to the men already mentioned, several gangs are still working on the fence surrounding the grounds, and, altogether, the grounds present a very animated appearance.</p></div2>

He investigated especially the western party of the city and was apparently well satisfied with the outlook, but Council Bluffs is willing to do something more than merely granting permission for camp grounds in the bottom lands. The magnificent hills east of Fairmont park, densely wooded and grass-covered, with an abundance of water and possibilities for perfect sanitary conditions, will be placed at their disposal. A dozen camps, each affording remarkable facilities for military operations, can be selected.</p></div2>

<p>The Department of Buildings and Grounds of the Transmississippi Exposition was authorized, at the regular meeting of the executive committee this afternoon to employ architects and secure plans for six of the main buildings of the exposition, to let contracts for these buildings and to push the work with all possible speed.</p>
<p>Manager Kirkendall reported that he had been in correspondence with a number of the most celebrated architects in the United States on exposition work, and was prepared to close contracts with them. He was authorized to so do at once, and announced that the following architects be employed by telegraph and urged to commence work on the plans of the buildings at once: S. S. Beman and Dwight H. Perkins, Chicago; Cass Gilbert, St. Paul, Minn.; John J. Humphreps, Denver; Eames &amp; young, St. Louis, Mo., and Fisher &amp; Lawrie, Omaha. The assignment of the buildings to the various architects has not yet been made, but this will be done at once and it is thought that contracts for the erection of the buildings will be let within thirty days.</p>
<p>Manager Reed of the Department of Concessions was authorized to make contracts with com missionaries and enter into all necessary negotiations in connection with pushing work in his department.</p>
<p>W. L. May, member of the Nebraska State Fisheries' commission, was appointed honorary commissioner of the fisheries section of the Department of Exhibits.</p>
<p>The matter of furnishing camp ground and water for the encampment of the militia in the mobilization scheme was considered and the executive authorized to make the assurance that the necessary ground and water for the encampment would be supplied to the government without charge.</p></div2>

    <div3>
<p>The investigation of the officers of the Department of the Platte into the conditions attending a mobilization of the national guards of the several states at Omaha in 1898 are nearly completed and a report will probably be made to the secretary of war within a few days. The information called for by the War department from General Coppinger, commanding the Department of the Platte, includes information regarding the availability of the land surrounding Omaha for such an encampment, also the cost of the maintenance of a large body of troops at this point and the probable cost of transporting these troops to and from the encampment.</p>
<p>Investigations have been made of the country immediately adjacent to Omaha and a number of locations have been found which are suitable for an encampment such as is proposed. Two locations in particular have been viewed with especial favor. Both are entirely suitable and it is thought that both are obtainable with little or no expense. One of these is the country in the vicinity of Miller park and old Fort Omaha, together with the rolling land to the north and west, making a tract about 600 or 800 acres in extend. The other site which is regarded very favorably is in the vicinity of Council Bluffs. The land lies near the Union Pacific transfer rounds in Council Bluffs. It is on what engineers would designate as the "second bench" above the river. It lies west of the transfer and includes about 700 acres.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">MATTERS FOR CONSIDERATION.</head>
<p>The most important consideration in selecting ground for camping is to secure good drainage and plenty of water. The two locations mentioned meet these requirements fully. Both may be plentifully supplied with water from the pumping stations of Omaha and Council Bluffs. An average water supply of five gallons per day per man is said by General Coppinger to be necessary. This does not include the amount which will be required for mounted troops or batteries of light artillery, both of which require large numbers of horses. These will probably require fifteen gallons per day for each man and horse.</p>
<p>The matter of securing the land in the vicinity of Fort Omaha for this encampment will be brought before the executive committee of the exposition, and the securing of the land on the Council Bluffs side of the river has been placed in the hands of Director Lucius Wells and George F. Wright of Council Bluffs. They will lay the matter before the Merchants' and Manufacturers' association of Council Bluffs at its next meeting and effort will be made to secure the necessary amount of land.</p>
<p>If both these tracts can be secured the encampment will probably be divided into two divisions, one division being located on each of these tracts. This will allow of opportunities for maneuvering of the two corps as opposing armies.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">TWO GREAT ARMIES.</head>
<p>With an appropriation by the general government it is safe to estimate that at least 100,000 of the 130,000 members of the militia will be present, and this will allow of two corps of 50,000 men each, aside from the large detachments of regular troops which will be encamped here at the same time. This number of men will form two armies of no mean proportions and the movements of troops will be on a scale not equaled in this country since the days of the strife between the north and the south. The amount of ground referred to in the two tracts in contemplation will give ample room for the formation of the troops, but the general movement will be over a large extent of territory surrounding the three cities of Omaha, Council Bluffs and South Omaha.</p>
<p>The importance of this movement to Omaha can scarcely be estimated. In the matter of supplies for the commissary department of such a vast body of troops the figures are surprising. Taking as a basis for computation the regulation army ration, the following figures represent the amount of supplies which will be required each day to feed 100,000 men:</p>

<p>In addition to the articles mentioned the troops would consume a vast amount of fresh vegetables and other supplies. The supplies heretofore enumerated aggregate 274,250 pounds, or about seven carloads per day.</p>
<p>In addition to the advantage derived from the purchase of this large amount of material from the merchants of this section, as well as the gardeners, experience shows that it may be safely estimated that each member of this large force of troops will spend at least $10 during his stay in camp and <note type="citation">many will spend much more.</note></p></div3></div2>

Among the persons and corporations called on were: George Gould, president of the Missouri Pacific; General Eckert, president of the Western Union; President Chandler of the Postal Telegraph; George M. Pullman of the Pullman Palace Car company, President Green of the Barber Asphalt company, President William H. James of the Lincoln National bank, the Wagner Palace Car company, Francis and Ben Smith, New England Loan and Trust company and others.</p>
<p>Saturday was taken up by a canvass of Philadelphians, including Mr. Shipley, president of the Provident Life and Trust company; ex-governor Pattison of the Security Life and Trust company, Francis C. Grable of the Edgemont Improvement company. They also interviewed Eward C. Cramp and Mr. Gibb of the Marsden Cellulose company, with a view to an extensive exhibit of cornstalk fabrics and food products. On this point most encouraging assurances were given, with the promise of a large plant located in or near Omaha within the next year. The delegation visited the United States mint and was cordially received by the superintendent, who expressed a willingness to extend all facilities at his disposal for the exposition, and assured the committee that he would detail a first-class artist for preparing designs and dies for medals and convey one of the largest coin presses to Omaha, where medals will be struck on the ground as rapidly as wanted.</p>
<p>The committee feels encouraged by the deep interest manifested, and assurances of liberal subscriptions from nearly all who were called on.</p>
<p>This afternoon the delegation was entered at the Union League club house by Clayton McMichael, proprietor of the Philadelphia North American.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">WORKING UNDER HIGH PRESSURE.</head>
<head type="sub">Department of Buildings and Grounds of the Exposition is Busy.</head>
<p>The Department o Buildings and Grounds of the exposition is in operation, and from this time until the gates are opened, in June, 1898, this department will work under high pressure in order to make up for the time that has been lost through unavoidable delays.</p>
<p>Appointments of the architects announced Friday were mailed yesterday, together with instructions to each architect to come to Omaha at once and look over the ground, consult with the supervising architects, and get the general scheme of the grounds in order to be prepared to turn out the plans in the shortest possible time. The outside architects are expected to be in Omaha some time during the coming week for this purpose.</p>

<pb n="162" xml:id="TMISB02-162"/>

<p>The general dimensions of the main buildings have been decided upon by the department about as follows: Agriculture, and Mines and Mining, each, 140x400 feet; Manufactures and Liberal Arts and Electricity and Machinery, each, 140x300 feet; Spectatorium, 130x160 feet, with a seating capacity of 3,500. The dimensions of the Art building have not been definitely fixed. The assignment of the buildings tot he several architects will be announced early next week.</p>
<p>A project is now on foot to sink one or more artesian wells on the exposition grounds to supply water for the lakes and lagoons. The Omaha Brewing association has just completed a well on its premises on Sherman avenue not very far from the exposition grounds, which is very successful. A flow of 100 gallons per minute was struck at a depth of 600 feet, the water being clear and limpid and having a temperature of 58 degrees. It is thought that a well 1,000 feet deep on the exposition grounds would give all the water necessary for the lakes and would be much cheaper than buying water from the Omaha Water company. the park board has the matter under consideration and may put in a well on that portion of the ground to be hereafter known as Kountze park.</p>
<p>Applications for concessions continue to multiply and it appears to be highly probable that additional ground will have to be set aside for the large number of really meritorious attractions which are sending in their applications for space. Among the latest applications is one for a street of Cairo. Application for this concession is made by Mohammed Pasha, a loyal subject of the Ottoman empire. He promises to produce an entertainment of the highest grade if allowed space on the grounds. Another applicant wants to reproduce a southern plantation, showing life in the sunny southland "'foh de wah."</p>
<p>The executive committee of the Board of Lady Managers was called to meet yesterday morning, but an adjournment was taken owing to the fact that there was not a quorum of the members present.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Acting Supervising Architect Praises the Exposition Ensemble.</head>
<p>WASHINGTON, May 1.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;In conversation with Mr. Kemper, acting supervising architect of the Treasury department, as to the grouping of buildings at the Transmississippi and International Exposition, to be held at Omaha next year, photographs of the ensemble having been shown him by the correspondent of The Bee, the acting supervising architect, in the absence of Mr. Aiken, said: "I am more than pleased with the general outlook for the exposition. Everything seem to have been chosen with excellent judgment. The site has been selected with care and the general position of the grounds leads me to think that the arrangement will have a most artistic appearance. The buildings have been apportioned and located in harmony, and with a practical judgment, so that the sightseer may, with little trouble, view the features of the exposition. I have made quite a careful examination of the possibility of transportation, and I cannot compliment the management and architects-in-chief, Messrs Walker and Kimball, enough for their ability in this very important feature. Its value to the public convenience cannot be overestimated. In the usual plans laid out for expositions, it has been my observation that only artistic effects are <choice><sic>stroven</sic><corr>striven</corr></choice> for, and the comforts of the visitors are overlooked. The Chicago exposition was the first to give attention to this subject, and an analysis of the plans for the Omaha Exposition shows that a great deal of care has been given tot he comfort of the visitor, so that he may, without inconvenience, view the artistic, as well as the educational features without losing the effect in its entirety.  The exposition in hand for Omaha is on generous lines and I cannot help but think that from an educational standpoint, as well as from the standpoint of beauty and perfect grouping, it will be next to the Chicago exposition, the best we have had since the celebration of the 400th anniversary of the landing of Columbus.</p>
<p>"An empire lies west of the Mississippi river. History has been made rapidly in that section of the country, and I cannot but look upon this exposition as being far-reaching in its character, and to the thousands of eastern people who will journey thither, the vastness of the territory bounded by the name, the Transmississippi country, the ingenuity of its people, their courage in the midst of adversity, cannot help but make for good for that section of the United States which but a very short time ago was included in what was then known as the "Great American Desert."</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Plan to Bore for Water at Exposition Grounds.</head>
<p>The Department of Buildings and Grounds of the exposition will sink an artesian well on the portion of the grounds to b used after the exposition as a public park. It is anticipated that this well, with one or more additional weeks to be sunk hereafter, will supply all the water required for the lakes and lagoons, and also all other water required on the exposition grounds. This action was authorized at a special meeting of the executive committee held at the Commercial club rooms at noon today, Manager Kirkendall being instructed to enter into a contract for the sinking of one well at <unclear reason="torn"></unclear></p>
<p>It has been demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt, by a well just completed <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> the property of the Omaha Brewing association just south of the exposition grounds, that there is a plentiful supply of water in that portion of the city, and it is also shown that the water is of exceptional purity. It is estimated that two or three of these wells, with the flow which can undoubtedly be secured, will supply the lakes and lagoons with clear, sparking water. This water will also be of such a character that it will undoubtedly be sought after for drinking purposes.</p>

    <div3>
<p>WASHINGTON, May 6.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The Transmississippi and International Exposition will be $75,000 richer should the sundry civil bill, as passed by the senate late this afternoon, become a law. the sundry civil bill for two days has been the subject of discussion, amendment after amendment being attached. The Pettigrew amendment to abrogate the forest reservation order of President Cleveland brought out the west against the east, and the amendment was attached by the close vote of 25 to 23. Following this Senator Thurston moved an amendment increasing the appropriation for the Omaha Exposition $75,000. He followed the motion by a short speech, and the amendment was incorporated as a part of the bill. Senator Thurston also asked that the amount be made instantly available, stating that the exposition was well under way and that plans for the government building had not yet been begun. This amendment to make available at once the whole appropriation was carried without division.</p>
<p>Senator Thurston also secured an amendment making an appropriation of $5,000 to continue the beet sugar investigation. The sundry civil bill now goes to the conference committee.</p></div3>

<p>Owing to Senator Pettigrew's amendment to the sundry civil bill regarding forest reservations, it was impossible to hold a conference on the Indian appropriation bill this afternoon. House members were present, but Cockrell and Pettigrew of the senate committee were anxious to go upon record upon the question of abrogating Cleveland's order setting aside millions of acres of forest lands of public domain. This interfered with the conference and it was decided that a meeting should be held tomorrow at 10:30 o'clock.</p>
<p>Senators and representatives from Nebraska are receiving telegraphic communications almost hourly from all sections of the state, urging the importance of supporting their local interests as outlined in the tariff bill.

<head type="sub">ACTIVITY AT THE EXPOSITION GROUNDS</head>
<head type="sub">Small Army of Men Employed in the Preliminary Work Necessary to the Holding of the Great Transmississippi Show.</head>
    <div3>
<p>One of the most exhilarating places in town is the exposition grounds in the northern party of the city. Here may be seen large gangs of men hard at work making preparations for the erection of the magic city which is to spring up on the now vacant land and present an appearance of architectural splendor which will excite the admiration of the most critical traveler. The eight-foot fence which is to enclose the entire grounds is completed, with the exception of the several openings which have been left to accommodate the travel in that section. These will not be closed until it becomes necessary to do so in order to prevent interference with the work. The grading of the lakes and lagoons is proceeding with great rapidity and the whole appearance of the surface of the ground east of Twentieth street is being changed. Many men and teams are engaged in this work and a great showing has been made east of Twentieth street. The small army of men employed in grading is the center of the envious eyes of a large crowd of onlookers who loiter about the grounds from morning until night. The contractor for the artesian well has his material on the ground and the huge derrick has been erected over the spot where the well will be started. The engine and boiler are being placed in position and the other parts of the machinery are being arranged as fast as possible The contractor expects to be ready to start his drill early during the coming week. The drilling of the well of the Omaha Brewing association occupied three weeks and it is expected that the drilling of the well on the exposition grounds will not consume any longer time unless a boulder or some other obstruction is struck, necessitating the starting of a new hole.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">SOLUTION OF A PROBLEM</head>
<p>For several days a small gang of men have been busily engaged in digging a hole ten feet square and about fifteen feet deep just south of the lagoon and east of Twentieth street, directly north of the location of the towering derrick of the well driver. This hole has excited the curiosity of the inhabitants in the vicinity of the exposition grounds and visitors to the grounds have vainly asked the men making it what the hole was for. The men have been unable to throw any light on the matter and this only excited the curiosity still further. For the information of all interested parties it may be stated that this hole was made for the purpose of testing the capacity of the soil t hold water in order to determine whether it will be necessary to cement the bottom of the lagoons in order to prevent water from escaping through the bottom of the lagoons that the clay subs <unclear reason="torn"></unclear></p>

<pb n="163" xml:id="TMISB02-163"/>

<p>It is the purpose of the exposition authorities to raise the grade of Twentieth street through the Kountze tract to Manderson street, in order to overcome the slight depression in this part of the street. The earth from the lagoons will be used for this purpose as seen as the necessary legal preliminaries in the ways of ordinances have been enacted by the city authorities. The grade of the lots abutting on Twentieth street between the north line of the Kountze tract and Manderson street will also be raised in the same way in order to avoid having a depression at this point.</p>
<p>Supervising Architect Kimball will go to Chicago tomorrow night to confer with Architects Beman and Perkins of that city regarding the buildings which have been assigned to these men. Mr. Beman will design the Manufacturers and Liberal Arts building and Mr. Perkins the Electricity and Machinery building. These buildings will be "twins" in the sense that they will be located at opposite points on the axis of the grounds, and Mr. Kimball will confer with the architects with a view of securing unity of action in preparing the designs for these buildings.</p>
<p>The first application for space in the group of music, musical instruments and theater in the bureau of liberal arts was received yesterday, it being the application of the W. W. Kimball company of Chicago for 400 square feet of space for an exhibit of pianos and organs. It is understood that it is the intention of this company to put in this space, among other things, a grand pipe organ to be used in giving recitals and for furnishing music as it may be desired during the exposition. For this purpose it will send to Omaha an artist of wide reputation to preside over the instrument on such occasions.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">MONEY FOR THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">Stock Subscriptions Are Being Paid in Quite Promptly.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The monthly meeting of the board of directors of the Transmississippi Exposition yesterday afternoon was one of the most enthusiastic, as well as one of the briefest, meetings in the history of the exposition. The most important business transacted was the levying of an assessment of 25 per cent on all stock, payable June 1, in order to expedite the construction of the main buildings.</p>
<p>Governor Holcomb as present at the meeting and while they twenty-four faithful directors were waiting until the secretary could reach two other members in order to make a quorum, President Wattles introduced the governor to the meeting. The governor made a short talk, saying he had come to Omaha for the purpose of familiarizing himself with the exact situation regarding the exposition, and he expressed the greatest satisfaction at the healthy condition in which he had found everything in connection with the matter. He expressed himself very strongly in the matter of the change which had been made in the site of the grounds, saying that the situation had been greatly improved by the change. The governor assured the directors of his heart co-operation in all matters connected with the exposition with which he would have anything to do. The address of the governor was listened to with the closest attention by the directors present, and as hes at down he was liberally applauded.</p>
<p>President Wattles took occasion to score the directors who are absent from meetings of the board with great regularity and intimated very broadly that it was anything but fair for men who had been honored by being elected as directors to shirk the ordeal of attending the meetings of the board an thereby hindering those who did attend from transacting business.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">DELEGATES TO SALT LAKE.</head>
<p>While they were still waiting for a quorum the president called attention tot he fact that the meeting of the Transmississippi congress would be held in Salt Lake City July 14, and said the mayor had asked the board to recommend ten delegates from Omaha who would attend. He called for volunteers, but responses were not particularly numerous, several directors stating that they would take the matter under advisement and would go if possible.</p>
<p>Vice President Saunders spoke of his recent visit to Texas and said he had found considerable enthusiasm there regarding the exposition. He said he had addressed several meetings of the business organizations of Galveston and other cities and they had pledged co-operation in return for the assistance of Nebraska in their deep water projects. The speaker urged that a delegation be sent from Nebraska to attend their convention, which will be called soon.</p>
<p>A quorum having been secured by this time, the business of the meeting was taken up.</p>
<p>Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds submitted a lengthy report, showing the progress that has been made to date in his department. He reminded the directors that the necessity for pushing work also involved the necessity for further funds and he urged an assessment at once to increase the funds on hand. He assured the board that unless his department is hampered by outside influences the building and grounds will be ready for opening the exposition June 1, 1898.</p>
<p>The report was greeted with applause and John C. Wharton moved that an assessment of 25 per cent be levied, payable June 1.</p>
<p>In response to questions the information was elicited that of the 20 per cent heretofore levied about one-half has been paid, the amount collected being about $41,000. It was also shown that the payments made up to date are largely subscribers having just commenced to pay their assessments.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">BURLINGTON'S BIG PAYMENT.</head>
<p>Secretary Wakefield explained that nearly all of the larger subscribers had notified him that they would pay their assessments whenever called upon to do so. He said that they had been notified within the last three days that their money was needed and he stated that responses had been made promptly. He exhibited a check from the Burlington railroad for $4,500 which he had just received, being payment in full of all assessment of 5 per cent on their subscription of $30,000 having been paid some time ago. Mr. Wakefield stated that he was convinced that nearly all of the money called for by the assessment of 20 per cent heretofore levied would be paid within the next few days.</p>
<p>Attention was also called to the fact that it will be necessary to collect $200,000 in cash before July 9 in order to make the state appropriation of $100,000 available at the time when the State commission will be appointed by the governor in order that the work of the commission may not be hampered.</p>
<p>The encouraging nature of the situation as shown by these reports aroused the greatest enthusiasm among the directors and the motion to levy a 25 per cent assessment was carried without a dissenting voice, after which the meeting adjourned and the directors stood around in groups and discussed the situation with the greatest satisfaction.</p>
<p>Manager Kirkendall was the recipient of many congratulations for the manner in which the work of his department had been handled and he assured all hands that there would be no delay so far as his department is concerned if the money is forthcoming with which to keep the ball rolling and the work in full blast.</p></div3></div2>

<p>It is the purpose of the exposition authorities to raise the grade of Twentieth street through the Kountze tract to Manderson street, in order to overcome the slight depression in this part of the street. The earth from the lagoons will be used for this purpose as soon as the necessary legal preliminaries in the way of ordinances have been enacted by the city authorities. The grade of the lots abutting on Twentieth street between the north line of the Kountze tract and Manderson street will also be raised in the same way in order to avoid having a depression at this point.</p>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">INTEREST IN THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">Eastern Capitalists Promise Subscriptions to the Capital Stock.</head>
<p>Manager Edward Rosewater of the Department of Publicity of the exposition returned yesterday morning from an extended trip to New York and other large eastern cities in the interest of the exposition. Mr. Rosewater was accompanied on this trip by Manager Lindsey of the Department of Ways and Means, who has not yet returned to Omaha.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosewater reports very considerable success in the business which carried the members of the committee east. They had numerous conferences with heads of the large railway corporations, as reported in the telegraphic columns of The Bee at the time, and were given every assurance of substantial interest on the part of the railroads in the exposition in the way of liberal stock subscriptions. George M. Pullman, president of the Pullman car company, also promised to aid the exposition with a liberal subscription, and the same success was met with from the Western Union Telegraph company. Francis C. Grable, a former resident of Omaha, subscribed $500 for the Edgemont company of Edgemont, S. D., and promised a further subscription when he had opportunity to lay the matter before the directors. Altogether, Mr. Rosewater said he felt that the trip had been a most successful one, and that the result would be shown in a substantial increase in the stock subscription list.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosewater also stated that when the proper time comes he intends to make an effort to have the members of the International Postal Congress, now in session in Washington, of which congress Mr. Rosewater is one of the vice presidents, visit Omaha. It is the intention of the government to show the delegates as much of the United States as possible, by giving them a trip through the principal parts of the country, after the business of the congress is completed. Chicago has already invited the members of the congress to visit that city, and it is practically decided that the city will be visited. Mr. Rosewater said he intended to attempt to interest the delegates in the Transmississippi Exposition and would, if possible, endeavor to have the route extended so as to include Omaha. These delegates represent fifty-five nations of the earth, and are men of prominence in their several countries, and their endorsement of the exposition would have great weight with their governments.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Preliminary Steps Toward Organization Taken Last Night.</head>
<p>A meeting attended by a number of the business men of Omaha and South Omaha was held at the Commercial club rooms last night, to organize a cavalry brigade for escort duty during the exposition. It was organized by electing John L. Webster chairman, and G. W. Sues secretary. The business of the occasion was taken up without any delay and it was decided to form an independent cavalry organization with the following officers: One brigadier general, commanding; two colonels; two lieutenant colonels; four majors; five staff officers with the rank of colonel as follows: chaplain, surgeon, assistant surgeon, quartermaster and commissary; eight captains and sixteen lieutenants.</p>
<p>This contemplated the immediate organization of at least eight troops, and it was agreed that the number of privates in each troop should be in the neighborhood of fifty, making a total membership, on this basis, about 450.</p>
<p>It was decided that a portion of the general officers should be elected at once and the election proceeded, with the following result: John L. Webster was elected to be brigadier general; J. L. Paxton of South Omaha, colonel; Dudley Smith, lieutenant colonel; E. M. Bartlett and Dan Farrell, jr., majors; Dr. E. W. Lee, surgeon; and G. W. Sues, quartermaster. The filling of the remaining offices was deferred until a subsequent meeting.</p>
<p>It was decided to leave the matter of a name, uniform and further details of organizing the brigade to a committee of five, of which the brigadier general should be the chairman, with G. W. Sues, Dudley Smith, Dan Farrell, jr., and F. B. Millar.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned at a late hour and the chairman was authorized to call another meeting when the special committee is ready to report. The special committee will meet tomorrow afternoon at the office of Mr. Webster for the consideration of the matters referred to it.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Arrangement of the General Plan is Conceded by Competent Judges to Be the Most Artistic Result Possible to Be Attained.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The work of getting the exposition grounds and buildings in readiness for opening the gates to visitors June 1, 1898, is progressing with most commendable rapidity. A most prodigious amount of work has been done in the short time since the actual work of the Department of Buildings and Grounds was commenced. The supervising architects, Messrs. Walker and Kimball, were not appointed until the latter part of March, but since that time the general plan of the grounds has been arranged, the dredging of the lakes and lagoons is well under way, and the detailed ground plan for the grand court has been made. The architects are felicitating themselves over the fact that the point in the work which has thus been reached in a little over a month was not reached n the case of the World's fair for over a year from the time when the actual work in connection with the plans of the grounds were commenced.</p>
<p>The arranging of the details of the ground plan of the main court is in itself a task of no mean proportions. Before the architects of the buildings could commence their work of designing the huge structures which are to grace the main court, it was necessary to determine the exact elevation of every part of the base lines of the several buildings; to determine the grouping of the buildings, the size of each, the relation of each building to the general ensemble and numberless other details which appear very small but which require a considerable amount of calculating and study, for these steps are the necessary prerequisites to a harmonious general result.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">GENERAL PLAN ARTISTIC.</head>
<p>All this preliminary work is now complete and the plans of the architects show that the main court of the exposition, upon which the greatest amount of work and money will be concentrated, will be an architectural gem which will compare most favorably with any exposition the world has ever seen. The arrangement of the grounds has been conceded by qualified judges of such matters to be the most artistic disposition of the ground at the service of the exposition authorities which could possibly have been made. While no portion will be neglected and the <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> the fence will be beautified in the most pleasing manner, the architectural beauty of the ground will be largely concentrated on the main court, and visitors will be greeted by a sight which will make, at the outset, a favorable impression.</p>
<p>Reference has already been made to the grand entrance arch which will hold the attention of the visitor approaching the grounds by way of Twentieth street, from the south. Spanning Twentieth street, over the main gateway, this grand triumphal arch, the Arch of the States, grand and impressive in its magnificent proportions and striking in the color effect produced by the superimposed arches forming the frieze, in each of which will appear the coat of arms of one of the states, this towering structure will at once impress the visitor and prepare him for the beautiful ensemble which will attract his gaze after passing beneath it. The main court is so arranged that the impression of immense distance is created by means of constant reflection from the placid surface of the water in the lagoons. This effect is heightened by the liberal use of colonnades and balustrades, forming an architectural picture of great beauty and impressiveness.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">USE OF ARCHITECTURAL EFFECTS.</head>
<p>Each of the buildings on the main court will stand 100 feet from the bank of the lagoon. The buildings will be elevated considerable above the level of the surface of the water, and this will give excellent opportunities for the liberal use of balustrades or huge columns immediately in front of the buildings, with beautiful approaches by means of grand staircases with their attendant ornamentation. The main promenade in front of the buildings will be on a level intermediate between the level of the water surface and the base lines of the buildings. At intervals broad and easy steps will lead down to the water level, along which will be a pretty railing of classic design.</p>
<p>The grouping of the buildings on the main court has been changed slightly from the arrangement first announced. At the extreme eastern end of the main court the Machinery and Electricity building and the Manufactures and Liberal Arts building will be on opposite sides of the lagoon, the first named facing south and the latter facing north, directly opposite. Each of these buildings to be 140x300 feet in size, and the general design <choice><sic>wil lharmonize</sic><corr>will harmonize</corr></choice> with the other.</p>
<p>On the north side of the lagoon, next west of the Machinery building, will be the Mines and Mining building. This will be 140x400 feet in size.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">TWIN BUILDING FOR ART.</head>
<p>Opposite the Mines and Mining building will be the Fine Arts building. The latter will be most unique in design and the architectural possibilities are almost unlimited. It has been decided to make this a composite or twin building, consisting of two buildings with a cloistered court between. The front of the building will have the appearance of one large building, with a colonnade extending across the entire front. The court between the buildings will be elaborately embellished with classic groups of statuary, marble fountains and rare plants, making it a beautiful spot. The ground at either ed of the Art building will be parked after the severe Italian style, the idea being to make the Art building the very exemplification of ideal art.</p>
<p>Twentieth street, the middle of the grounds, will intersect the main court immediately west of the Mines and Mining and Art buildings. This street will be spanned on the south side of the main court by the Arch of the States and on the north side of the court by the Administration Arch.</p>
<p>West of Twentieth street, on the north side of the main court,w ill be the Agriculture building, 140x400 feet in size, and opposite to this, on the south side of the lagoon, will be the spectatorium.</p>
<p>At the extreme western end of the main court, facing the east, will be the federal government building. Between it and the other main buildings on the west portion of the main court the lagoon will broaden into a pool whose placid surface will reflect the beautiful outlines of the stately building to be erected by the government. Between the government building and the edge of the water will be a broad plaza, giving opportunity for embellishment in the way of obelisks and statuary, which will form a most imposing effect.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">APPROACH TO VIADUCT.</head>
<p>At the extreme eastern end of the main court will be a grand circular staircase, giving approach to the handsome and artistic viaduct which will span Sherman avenue at this point. The free use of balustrades and columns in connection with this approach will round out the architectural effect of this very prominent feature of the main court.</p>
<p>All of the buildings in the main court will be linked together by means of covered colonnades, greatly enhancing the architectural effect of the whole and adding immeasurably to the classic ensemble of the picture, besides serving as a means of avoiding the warm rays of the sun during the summer months. The spaces between the buildings will be parked in the most artistic manner and will be supplied with shady nooks, in which the visitors may rest and enjoy the beauties of nature.</p>
<p>Extending entirely around the main court, at the rear of the buildings, will be a paved roadway for use in conveying supplies to and from the buildings out of sight from the inner court, besides affording a passageway for the fire department apparatus in case of necessity.</p>
<p>The main buildings will be constructed of stucco, but the dazzling white, which has characterized many former expositions, will be avoided, and the stucco will be give a harmonious color, which will rest the eyes and produce a pleasing effect. The exact color to be used has not been determined, but it is likely that the general tone will be a soft creamy tint, heightened by contrasting colors, laid on with artistic effect.</p>
<p><unclear reason="torn"></unclear>buildings on the main court has<unclear reason="torn"></unclear> expects to secure a breadth of treatment in these large buildings which will add very greatly to the artistic effect of the whole. The architects selected are among the most prominent in their profession in the country, and almost without exception, they have had extended experience in exposition work, thereby qualifying them to secure the best results in the shortest possible time. These men, and the buildings they will design, are as follows: Agriculture building, Cass Gilbert, St. Paul, Minn.; Art building, Eames &amp; Young, St. Louis, Mo.; Electricity and Machinery building, Dwight Perkins, Chicago; Mines and Mining building, J. J. Humphrey of Denver, Colo.; Manufactures building, S. S. Beman, Chicago; Spectatorium, Fisher &amp; Lawrie, Omaha. The Arch of States, the Administration arch and the viaduct spanning Sherman avenue, together with the approach to this viaduct, will be in direct charge of the supervising architects, Walker &amp; Kimball, who will design and erect them.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">BLACK HILLS FEELS AN INTEREST.</head>
<head type="sub">Will Be on Hand at the Exposition.</head>
<p>The Department of Exhibits of the exposition has received notice from J. P. Hymer of Deadwood, S. D., commissioner for the Black hills, that a great interest has been aroused in that section in the matter of making a large exhibit of the resources of the Black Hills at the exposition.</p>
<p>The Black Hills Times of May 6 contains a column account of a meeting held in Deadwood on May 5 for the purpose of discussing this subject. According to this account the liveliest interest was manifested in the matter and the most influential citizens of that section participated in the discussion. After a long discussion it was decided to apply for at least 3,000 square feet of space in which to display the resources of the Black Hills region, and a petition was prepared for circulation asking the county commissioners to make an appropriation to pay for the space, and a resolution was adopted asking other counties in the state to co-operate with Lawrence county in making displays of the resources of the entire state.</p>
<p>A resolution was also adopted calling upon the communities in all parts of Lawrence county to appoint committees to meet in Deadwood June 8 to arrange for a creditable exhibit from that county.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">Contracts for Stationery.</head>
<p>Contracts were let this morning for 100,000 application blanks to Klopp, Bartlett &amp; Co. for $588, and to the Rees Printing company for 100,000 No. 14 envelopes for $125 for the exposition. Both of these figures are somewhat lower than the contracts for the first lot of these supplies.</p></div2>
    
<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">An Agent for New Zealand.</head>
<p>At the next meeting of the executive committee Manager Bruce of the Department of Exhibits will recommend that a special agent be sent to New Zealand for the purpose of securing exhibits and concessions from that country.</p></div2>

<p>WASHINGTON, May 11.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The senate today concurred in the report of the conference committee on the Indian supply depot for Omaha. Senator Cullom of Illinois was inclined to oppose the motion to concur, but he was pulled off before any serious damage had been done to the amendment. Representative Sherman of New York, chairman of the house committee on Indian affairs, said to The Bee correspondent today that he would present the conference report on the bill Thursday, but he thought the Omaha amendment would be defeated. Mr. Sherman is representing large New York interest in his fight on the amendment and is being helped by Chicago, both cities seeing in the establishment of a depot at Omaha a menace to their monopoly, which they have enjoyed for years. Chicago representatives are saying tonight that the house will not concur in the Omaha amendments, and that the house conferees will be instructed to hold out for its defeat, come what may.</p>
<p>W. H. Michael, who has been appointed chief clerk of the State department, will assume the duties of the office next Saturday, his difficulties with the civil service commission having been adjusted.

<ab>Printers:</ab>
<p>The management of the Trans-Mississippi &amp; International Exposition, has succeeded in securing the manufacture of a good white business envelope size 6 1/2 bearing the official design of the Exposition upon its face, a sample of which will be found printed hereon, and on the envelope in which this letter is enclosed. This envelope can be secured through any paper or stationary supply house in the state at very little additional expense over the cost of the plain envelope. These envelopes are not gotten up for the purpose of a money making venture as there is no profit accruing to the manufacturer or those who handle them beyond their customary profit on the plain envelope of the same quality, and the Exposition management has secured their co-operation in the matter of this character of advertisement wholly through the desire of these people to be of any benefit possible in the promotion of our Exposition.</p>
<p>As you are the one who comes in contact with the consumer you are urged to use your every effort with your customer to use and order of you envelopes bearing the official design of the Exposition. Through your efforts and others in the same branch of business we shall be able to secure the desired result, viz: that every business house in the west will use envelopes advertising the Exposition.</p>
<p>We do not believe argument is necessary in this case to secure your assistance as no doubt you are heartily in sympathy and accord with the objects and aims of this enterprise, therefore, we shall expect that within a short space of time our efforts in this line will bear fruit.</p>

<head type="sub">EXPOSITION BUILDINGS TO BE DISCUSSED</head>
<head type="sub">Meeting to Be Held in This City, at Which the Details of All Exposition Structures Will Be Considered.</head>
<p>T. R. Kimball of the firm of Walker &amp; Kimball, supervising architects of the exposition, has returned to the city after a trip to Chicago to confer with the architects of two of the main buildings of the exposition. Mr. Kimball was accompanied on his return by Charles H. Walker, the other member of the firm. While in Chicago Messrs. Walker and Kimball had several conferences with S. S. Beman, <choice><sic>arcitect</sic><corr>architect</corr></choice> of the Manufacturers' and Liberal Arts buildings, and Dwight Perkins, architect of the Machinery and Electricity building, regarding the general plans of those buildings.</p>
<p>The architects of the six main buildings will meet in Omaha the latter part of next week for the purpose of conferring regarding the several buildings and securing a general harmonious result. Besides the two Chicago architects heretofore mentioned, there will be present Eames &amp; Young of St. Louis, architects of the Art building; Cass Gilbert of St. Paul, architect of the Agriculture building; J. H. Humphreys of Denver, architect of the Mines and Mining building, and Fisher &amp; Laurie of Omaha, architects of the Spectatorium.</p>
<p>At this meeting the several architects will be expected to present preliminary sketches of their respective buildings and these will then be discussed in a general way and the sketches will be made to harmonize. After this important preliminary step the several architects will return home and will at once commence the work of making the detail drawings for these main buildings.</p>
<p>The supervising architects have decided that the height of the cornice on the Manufactures and the Machinery buildings shall be thirty-five feet, and the cornice line of the Agriculture and Mines building shall be forty feet. The differences in the elevations of the base lines of these buildings will bring the cornices of all of them on the same line. It has also been decided that the module to be used in all the buildings shall be sixteen feet, this being done in order to insure uniformity in the units.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">AN EXHIBIT FOR THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">Managers Seeking to Secure Old DeWitt Clinton Engine.</head>
<p>The Department of Exhibits of the exposition has opened negotiations with the management of the New York Central &amp; Hudson River railroad to secure the old DeWitt Clinton engine and train, the first passenger train ever operated in this country. This relic formed a striking exhibit at the World's fair and efforts will be made to have it exhibited at the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
<p>One of the five passengers carried by this historic train on its trip is a resident of Bancroft, Neb. His name is Giles P. Ransom and he is 84 years of age. He is a hale and hearty specimen from the hills of Vermont and is one of the most prominent citizens of the flourishing Nebraska town where he resides. Mr. Ransom was a prominent figure at the World's fair, where he formed a part of thee exhibit of the first passenger train, and he has written the Department of Exhibits of the Transmississippi Exposition that he will be pleased to perform the same duty in connection with the exhibit here.</p>
<p>This historic old relic made its first trip from Albany to Schenectady August 9, 1831, and Mr. Ransom, who at that time was about 18 years old, was one of the five passengers. At that time the railroad was known as the Mohawk &amp; Hudson River road, but is now a part of the great New York Central system.</p>
<p>If this engine and train can be secured it will make a fit companion piece for the car which was used to convey the remains of the martyred Lincoln from Washington to Springfield. This old car is now the property of the Union Pacific and the officials of that road have agreed that it shall form a feature of the transportation exhibit.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">Notes of the Exposition.</head>
<p>A row of piling is being driven at the extreme eastern portion of the Kountze tract to allow of the filling in of the approach to the viaduct over Sherman avenue.</p>
<p>Work on the sinking of the artesian well on the exposition grounds was commenced last night. The work is progressing rapidly and unless a rock is struck it is expected that the well will be completed in about three weeks.</p>
<p>The Board of Park Commissioners will meet tomorrow afternoon. The question of improvements on the Kountze property which is expected to be turned over to the board for a park in connection with the exposition will be raised and an effort will be made to bring the matter to a focus one way or the other.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">REDUCED LICENSE FOR THE SHOW.</head>
<head type="sub">Making it Easier for the Exposition Attractions.</head>
<p>City Attorney Connell is preparing an ordinance to amend the present license ordinance, so that it will afford easier terms to museums and other attractions which are expected to visit the city immediately before and during the exposition. Under the present regulations every side show of this character would be compelled to pay a fee of $2 a day. A number of city officials are of the opinion that the shows that come and remain during the exposition should be given a license for a longer time at a somewhat reduced rate. It is urged that there is a distinction between these affairs and the freak shows that come to the city for a day or two and take away what they obtain.</p>
<p>It is expected that many attractions will be located here for several months during the exposition and a large proportion of their receipts will be from visitors. These will be largely expended in this city and it is contended that it will be a better policy to offer them some encouragement in the way of more favorable regulation.</p></div2>

<p>The announcement of the liberal subscription of $20,000 of the Rock Island railroad system to the Transmississippi Exposition, making the total contributions of the railroads centering in Omaha mount will up to the $100,000 mark, is pleasing evidence that these great corporations are doing the right thing by Omaha and its gigantic enterprise. President Cable of the Rock Island road and his associates on the directory will deserve in return for their good will the thanks of the community and their road a continuance of the patronage and traffic it has built up in this part of the country.</p>
<p>As another example for the railroads and other corporate interests that are not yet represented on the exposition stock books this new addition should prove a valuable help. With ample funds behind it the exposition will surpass the most sanguine expectations as to its success, and the growing stock subscription list is the beset proof of its financial soundness and stability.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">PLANS OF ADMINISTRATION ARCH.</head>
<head type="sub">Structure to Grace Main Court of Exposition Grounds.</head>
<p>The preliminary sketch showing the elevation and general design of the administration arch which will grace the main court of the exposition grounds opposite the stately Arch of States has been completed by Architect Walker, this being one of the structures which will be "done" by the architect-in-chief. The sketch shows a striking tower after the French renaissance style, 150 feet in height and 50x50 feet on the ground. The four corners each terminate in a spire, surmounted by a flagstaff, while the central spire towers many feet above them, its summit rising above all of the other buildings which form the main court. The design is most pleasing, the general effect being one of elegance, characteristic of this school of architecture.</p>
<p>The arch will span Twentieth street directly opposite the Arch of States on the north side of the main court. These two arches will form the axis of the main court, the visitor entering the main gate to the grounds by passing beneath the Arch of States, and reaching the north tract by passing beneath the Administration arch. This arch will be about thirty feet in height and broad enough to allow a large number of persons to pass through it at one time.</p>
<p>The offices of the clerical force and executive officers necessary to be one the grounds <choice><sic>wil</sic><corr>will</corr></choice> be in this building. The office rooms will be above the arch end and will be commodious and handsome.</p>

<head type="sub">Prepared to Submit Plans of the Buildings Assigned.</head>
<p>Architects of the main buildings of the exposition arrived in Omaha this morning for a consultation with the supervising architects, Walker &amp; Kimball. The only architect who was not present was Cass Gilbert of St. Paul, the architect of the Agricultures building. Mr. Gilbert was detained by a lawsuit in which he is a witness and will not be here until tomorrow.</p>
<p>The architects in the city are Thomas Youngs of the firm of Eames &amp; Youngs, St. Louis architect of the Art building; J. J. Humphreys, Denver, who will design the Mines and Mining building; Dwight Perkins, Chicago, who has been assigned the Machinery and Electricity building; S. S. Beman, Chicago, architect of the Manufactures and Liberal Arts building, and Fisher &amp; Lawrie, Omaha, architects of the spectatorium.</p>
<p>Each man came prepared with a preliminary sketch of the building assigned to him and all of these will be subjected to the crucial test of a conference of all the architects and will be altered as may be necessary to produce a harmonious effect. The architects,accompanied by Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds and General Superintendent Dion Geraldine, went out to the grounds this morning. The visiting architects were delighted with <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>eral plan of the grounds as arranged by the supervising architects, and were especially enthusiastic over the architectural possibilities of the Kountze tract, on which the main court will be located.</p>
<p>The afternoon was devoted to a conference on the designs of the several building. Some of the architects will leave for home tonight and others will remain in the city until tomorrow.</p>
<p>An application for a concession for a company of dancing girls has been received by the Department of Concessions from a man connected with a New york paper. He applies for 1,800 feet of space.</p>

    <head type="main">ARCHITECTS IN CONFERENCE</head>
<head type="sub">SKETCHES OF EXPOSITION BUILDINGS</head>
<head type="sub">Design of Structures Along Renaissance Lines and Harmonious, Comparing Favorably with Buildings at Other Expositions.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The first conference of the architects of the main buildings of the Transmississippi Exposition, which was held yesterday, was a most pleasing surprise to those concerned. It had been anticipated that when the preliminary sketches of the buildings on the main court were presented many changes would be required in order to produce a harmonious result, as none of the architects had any opportunity to learn what the others would produce, but when the sketches were shown it was found that scarcely any changes would be necessary. The general designs of all the buildings were found to be entirely harmonious and congratulations were freely exchanged. This condition was most gratifying to all of the architects and the supervising architects were especially pleased, as the work was expedited very much thereby. If many changes had been necessary two or three weeks would have been required to make them and the completion of the work would have been delayed just that much longer.</p>
<p>The sketches in question were not expected to be complete in the details of ornamentation, etc., but were simply intended to be suggestive. By a curious coincidence, all of the buildings were designed along the renaissance style. This style will allow of the greatest latitude in the way or ornamentation and the treatment of columns, capitals, etc., will be broad and pleasing. The architecture will be strictly classic, but along lines which will comprehend the best effects. Some of the buildings will have flat domes, but the majority will have pinnacles, as well as of the general details of ornamentation, is a matter for future consideration at the hands or each architect. As soon as the finished drawings of the buildings are received by the supervising architects they will be given the widest publicity.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">PLEASED WITH THE OUTLOOK.</head>
<p>All of the architects were greatly pleased with the outlook for an attractive architectural effect, and the opinion was freely expressed that the Transmississippi Exposition would compare most favorably, from an architectural standpoint, with any former exposition. One of the points emphasized was that none of the buildings would suggest in any way any of the buildings at the World's fair.</p>
<p>All of the architects except Cass Gilbert of St. Paul, who did not arrive until this morning, were entertained at dinner at the Millard hotel last night by the four members of the executive committee who were in the city, Messrs. Kirkendall, Bruce, Reed and Babcock, and President Wattles and General Superintendent Geraldine. The sketches of the buildings brought by the architects were placed around the room in the relative position the buildings themselves will occupy on the exposition grounds. The exposition officials were greatly pleased with the effect. It was the unanimous opinion that these buildings, heightened by the connecting link formed by the colonnades, will form a picture of classic architecture which will be most pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>Cass Gilbert of St. Paul, architect of the Agricultures building, arrived in the city this morning, having been detained by business. He visited the exposition grounds in company with the supervising architects and  Messrs. Perkins and Humphreys, architects of the Electricity and Mines buildings respectively. Like the others, Mr. Gilbert was most favorably impressed by the arrangement of the grounds and his sketch required as little alteration as those of the other architects.</p>
<p>All of the architects will at once begin work on the drawings for the main buildings and it is expected that the completed drawings will be in the hands of the supervising architects within the next three weeks.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WORK ON GOVERNMENT BUILDING.</head>
<p>H. A. Fuller, superintendent of government buildings west of the Mississippi river, has been instructed by the State department to assume charge of the preliminary work on the government building on the exposition grounds. Mr. Fuller is at present in Denver. he has also been instructed to take charge of the work on the postoffice building in Chicago. He is expected in Omaha shortly to confer with the authorities on exposition matters. </p>
<p>It is expected that bids for constructing the Administration building will be asked for about June 1. The drawings are almost completed and bids for its construction will be asked as soon as possible, as the building will be used as headquarters on the grounds as soon as it is completed.</p>
<p>Manager Reed of the Department of Concessions says he will soon be ready to let contracts for concessions. There are a large number of applicants for some of the concessions and some very satisfactory terms have been offered by bidders. For the Chinese concession there are four applicants, two of whom have been very active in pushing their claims. H. Sling, who had charge of the Chinese concession at the World's fair, has been in the city for several days in consultation with Mr. Reed and is very anxious to close the bargain. One of the other applicants for this concession has been in the city recently, urging that he be given the concession, and the competition in several of the lines has developed considerable warmth.</p>
<p>The artesian well contractor has removed his derrick and machinery a few feet south of the first hole and started another descent into the earth.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">TROOPERS FOR THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">Brigade Organization is to Be Completed Tomorrow Night.</head>
<p>A meeting of the Transmississippi Troopers will be held at the Commercial club rooms at 8 o'clock Saturday evening to complete the organization of the brigade. There has been considerable interest manifested in this movement among the horsemen about town and the indications for the organization of a crack cavalry brigade are regarded as most favorable. </p>
<p>The purpose of the originators of this movement was the organization of a mounted command to act as escort for the distinguished visitors to the city during exposition year, and also to take part in parades and other events where the appearance of a large number of mounted men in an attractive uniform would add greatly to the general effect.</p>
<p>That the movement has met with general favor is completely demonstrated by the large number and excellent character of the applications which have been received by the recruiting committee. The uniform which has been suggested by the committee having the matter in charge has met with general approval. The colors will be black and white, in simple, but tasty design and free from gaudiness or tinsel. The troopers will be armed with light cavalry sabers.</p>
<p>Among the members of the organization are many men with experience in military matters, and it is expected that the appearance of the entire brigade, from a military standpoint, will be most pleasing and effective.</p>
<p>All men in the city who are interested in the organization are invited to attend the meeting tomorrow night.</p></div2>

Cass Gilbert of St. Paul, who is to design the agricultural building, is the only one absent. He will be here today, but it was necessary for some of his confreres to leave last evening.</p>

<pb n="168" xml:id="TMISB02-168"/>

<p>John J. Humphreys of Denver, who has in his charge the mines and mining building, arrived Wednesday. Thomas Young of Eames &amp; Young, St. Louis, art building; Dwight H. Perkins, Chicago, machinery building, and S. S. Beman, Chicago, manufactures' building, arrived yesterday morning and these, with Fisher &amp; Lawrie, who are to make the drawings for the auditorium, are comparing notes and inspecting sketches.</p>
<p>Shortly after 11 o'clock yesterday the whole company, under the escort of Manager Kirkendall of the department of buildings and grounds, and Superintendent of Construction Geraldine, were taken for a drive over the grounds.</p>
<p>The visiting architects concurred unanimously in the opinion of the supervising architects, given some time ago, that the grounds, though somewhat irregular as to boundary, are susceptible of a unique and impressive treatment, and that the Kountze tract, where the principal architectural effect will be attempted, is particularly will adapted for carrying out the grand design.</p>
<p>It was believed that by bringing all the architects together here for a common inspection of the grounds and mouth-to-mouth discussion of the plans relating thereto a more harmonious ensemble could be secured. The visitors already say that this result is plain.</p>
<p>The supervising architects are not willing today to give any specific information as to the sketches that have been submitted or the suggestions that are being offered, but say that it is likely that a good idea of what the architects have in their heads can be described tomorrow. It is stated that some very fine preliminary work has been brought, and that the project is being entered into with enthusiasm by every man who has been engaged to give his attention to it..</p>
<p>As was stated a few days ago, work on the construction drawings will begin at once, and it is thought that in a few weeks contracts may be called for.</p>
<p>Mr. Beman and Mr. Young returned home last night. The other architects remained to still further talk over the plans today, when Mr. Gilbert of St. Paul will be here.</p>
<p>It is expected that another meeting of all the architects will be held in two weeks.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">COMMISSIONERS FOR IOWA</head>
<head type="sub">GUARDIANS OF THE HAWKEYE EXHIBIT</head>
<head type="sub">Governor Drake Will Summon the Members to Meet at Des Moines Next Week&#8212;Mostly Men of Exposition Experience.</head>
<p>DES MOINES, May 21.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The state executive council today appointed the Iowa commission to take charge of the state's interest at the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha. The commission is as follows:</p>
<p>First District&#8212;John H. Wallbank, Mount Pleasant; democrat.</p>
<p>Second District&#8212;S. D. Cook, Davenport; republican.</p>
<p>Third District&#8212;F. N. Chase, Cedar Falls; republican.</p>
<p>Fourth District&#8212;J. E. E. Markley, Mason City; democrat.</p>
<p>Fifth District&#8212;S. B. Packard, Marshalltown; republican</p>
<p>Sixth District&#8212;R. M. Moore, Ottumwa; democrat.</p>
<p>Seventh District&#8212;Allan Dawson, Des Moines; democrat.</p>
<p>Eight District&#8212;S. H. Mallory, Chariton; democrat.</p>
<p>Ninth District&#8212;George W. McCord, Logan; republican.</p>
<p>Tenth District&#8212;Owen Lovejoy, Jefferson; republican.</p>
<p>Eleventh District&#8212;A. W. Erwin, Sioux City, republican.</p>
<p>Most of the members have had special experience that qualifies them. Mr. Chase was secretary of the Iowa Columbian commission, secretary of the committee that handled Iowa's interests at the New Orleans Cotton Centennial, and connected with the Iowa Centennial commission. Ex-Governor Packard of Louisiana is known as one of the leading live stock men of the country, and will doubtless look after this important interest for Iowa. Mr. Mallory was vice president of the Iowa Columbian commission. Mr. Moore has been a director of the Ottumwa Coal Palace association, and Mr. Erwin has been president of the Sioux City Corn Palace association.</p>
<p>The members of the commission will have charge, under the general direction of the state executive council, of the expenditure of the state appropriation to secure proper representation at the Transmississippi Exposition. The act of the first session of the Twenty-sixth general assembly provided an appropriation of $10,000 for the beginning of the work, the expectation being that the amount would be increased by $25,000 or more by the Twenty-seventh general assembly.</p>
<p>The Iowa interest in the exposition has had a hard fight in various ways. When the last session of the legislature opened there was a strong disposition to repeal the appropriation made by the former session and it was only prevented by hard work. Before the end of the <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> appropriation ought not to be interfered with, and that the state was entitled to a first-class representation at the exposition. The feeling was very favorable to adding to the appropriation next winter.</p>
<p>J. S. Browning of this city, who was chief clerk of the Columbian exposition bureau of awards, has been selected as chief of the bureau of exhibits. Mr. Browning has been here all winter, looking after the legislature and elsewhere, and it was largely due to his efforts that the matter came out so well, from the standpoint of the exposition, as it did.</p>
<p>Governor Drake has announced that he will call the commission together in this city next Thursday for organization.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="main">SKETCH OF FEDERAL BUILDING</head>
<head type="sub">PREPARED BY EXPOSITION ARCHITECTS</head>
<head type="sub">Will Be Designed Along Lines Which Will Be in Harmony with Other Structures on the Main Court.</head>
<p>The supervising architects of the exposition, Walker &amp; Kimball, in order to expedite the work on the building to be erected by the United States for the housing of the government exhibit, are preparing a sketch of a building which will be offered to the federal authorities as a suggestion for a building which will be suitable for a government structure and will be designed along lines which will be in harmony with the other buildings on the main court.</p>
<p>The government building will stand at the west end of the main court, in the most commanding position on the grounds. The architects regard it as highly important that this building should present an imposing appearance and harmonize with the other buildings. For that reason, and also for the reason that there is no government supervising architect at the present time, the exposition architects have decided to do all in their power to obviate the delay that would ensue is no action were taken until a supervising architect is appointed.</p>
<p>The design now being prepared by Walker &amp; Kimball calls for a building 120x120 feet on the ground. It shows a structure, the most prominent feature being a well proportioned octagonal dome rising to a height of 112 feet from the ground to the lantern. The central portion of the building is about 120 square feet, with this dome rising fro the center. On each of the four corners of this central portion will be a smaller octagonal dome, and wings <choice><sic>wil</sic><corr>will</corr></choice> extend on either side of the main portion. Underneath the central dome a rotunda is suggested with a columned corridor, and the north and south ends will be halls about 50x100 feet. The front of the building will be ornamented by a portico with columns. The style will be classic, inclined toward the Roman. </p>
<p>The supervising architects are of the opinion that the government will adopt their suggestions in order to save time and in the event this is done the construction of this building may be commenced within a short time.</p>
<p>Walker &amp; Kimball feel greatly elated at the good feeling which was manifested by the architects of the main buildings during their first visit to consult regarding plans. All of the architects were enthusiastic and interested in the successful outcome of the exposition from an architectural standpoint, and all of them expressed their complete satisfaction with the manner in which the grounds had been laid out. Cass Gilbert of St. Paul, who is regarded as competent authority in architectural circles, said that the arrangement of the grounds was, without any exception, the best plan devised for any exposition. He said that the possibilities of the present arrangement are almost unlimited.</p>
<p>It is expected that the plans of the main buildings will be in the hands of the supervising architects with the next ten days.</p></div2>

<p>Manager Kirkendall announced the appointment of Harry Weatherwax of Chicago as chief draughtsman in the Department of Buildings and Grounds. The appointment was confirmed.</p>
<p>Mr. Kirkendall also announced the appointment of Andrew Rosewater as sanitary engineer of the exposition grounds at a salary of $350 covering the entire period of the exposition.</p>
<p>Manager Kirkendall also informed the committee that John Mack, a colored man living on Twentieth street just below the north tract of the exposition grounds, had torn down the fence erected in front of his house by the exposition people. Mr. Kirkendall said efforts had been made to make an amicable arrangement with the man, but they had been unsuccessful. Suggestions were <unclear reason="torn"></unclear></p>
<p>The duties and powers of the Women's Board of Managers were brought up by a letter from the secretary, Mrs. F. M.

<p>A general discussion was had on the subject matter of this communication and action was taken which will enable the women to take definite steps to secure the conventions of such organizations as have direct bearing upon the subjects coming under the jurisdiction of the women's board.</p>
<p>The Department of Promotion was authorized to make provision for furnishing a hall for the meeting of conventions, etc., during the exposition.</p>
<p>Manager Reed announced that David Henderson of Chicago, one of the most prominent exponents of the spectacular in state productions, was negotiating for a theatrical privilege on the grounds.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Transmississippi Troopers Working to Increase Membership.</head>
<p>The recruiting committee of the Transmississippi troopers, consisting of Clement Chase, H. T. Lemist and Dudley Smith, is sending out circulars to prospective members of the organization from which the following extracts are taken:</p>
<p>"The organization of a cavalry brigade for the purpose of escort duty to distinguished visitors during the exposition year has been completed. It is proposed to have a showing of mounted men, handsomely but not expensively uninformed, which will do credit to the town and be the subject of favorable remark from the thousands of strangers who will be within our gates during 1898. The brigade will be composed of troops from Omaha, under command of C. F. Weller, colonel; South Omaha, under command of James L. Paxton, colonel, and Council Bluffs, under command of Ed. W. Hart, major; the brigade being commanded by John L. Webster, brigadier general.</p>
<p>"A suitable uniform will be provided at a cost to each member of about $15, and members will also be expected to provide their own mounts. There will probably be no other expense, except an enrollment charge of $1 to cover incidentals of organization."</p>
<p>These circulars are accompanied by application blanks and the latter are coming back to the committee in a most encouraging manner.</p>

<head type="sub">Exposition Cavalry Proves Very Popular with Horsemen.</head>
<p>The third meeting of the Transmississippi Troopers, held last night at the Commercial club rooms, was one of the most representative gatherings of business men that has been seen in this city for a long time.

    <head type="main">WHAT UNCLE SAME EXHIBITS</head>
<head type="sub">DISPLAY MADE AT NASHVILLE CENTENNIAL</head>
<head type="sub">Appropriation for the Transmississippi Exposition Larger Than that for Nashville, and Government Show Correspondingly Better.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The exhibit made by the federal government at the Nashville Centennial exposition is attracting great attention and persons who have seen all the exhibits made by the government at expositions during recent years are of opinion that the Nashville exhibit is the most complete which has been made. People in the transmississippi region are especially interested in this exhibit for the reason that it will form the nucleus of the collection which will be shown at the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
<p>For the Nashville exposition the government of the United States made an appropriation of $130,000, which amount covered the expense of erecting the building and installing the exhibit. For the Transmississippi Exposition the government has appropriated $200,000.</p>
<p>The Nashville exhibit is divided into twelve sections, as follows: The executive mansion, the Department of State, Treasury department, War department, Navy department, Postoffice department, Department of the Interior, Department of Justice, Department of Agriculture, Smithsonian Institutions, National Museum and Fish Commission.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">PORTRAITS OF PRESIDENTS.</head>
<p>The exhibit made by the executive mansion is small and for convenience is made part of the exhibit of the Department of State. It contains a portrait of the president and vice president, steel engravings of all the presidents of the United States conveniently arranged, and a photograph of the executive mansion. The official working of the president's office is summarily shown by a blank form of nomination to the senate, omissions issued for different offices, samples of stationary, the official seal, a warrant directing the secretary of state to place the seal of the United States upon an executive instrument, and forms of letters used.</p>
<p>The Department of State has on exhibition one volume of the "Washington Papers" containing manuscript letters of George Washington, including that of December 29, 1783, resigning his commission as general of the army. This collection comprises 313 volumes. These is one volume each of the following <choice><sic>colections</sic><corr>collections</corr></choice>: The Madison papers, in seventy-five volumes; the Jefferson papers, in 131 volumes; the Hamilton papers, in sixty-five volumes, and the Franklin papers, in thirty-four volumes. The department has in its custody the original Declaration of Independence, but this precious document is so faded that it became necessary to protect it from the light. A fac-simile is exhibited with thirty-eight portraits of the signers. An artotype reproduction of the original constitution of the United States, with thirty-six portraits of the signers, makes an interesting exhibit.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">HANDWRITING OF ROYALTY</head>
<p>There is a fine collection of autograph letters from foreign officials and celebrities to the president of the United states, among them being Robespierre, Barere, Carnot, Louis, king of France, Napoleon I, Jerome Bonaparte, Queen Victoria, Alexander I of Russia; William I, emperor of Germany; President Diaz of Mexico; Ranavalmonicao, queen of Madagascar; Chulalongkorn, king of Siam. The autographs of the presidents are shown in original proclamations on various subjects, the only signature lacking being that of President William Henry Harrison, who died before signing a proclamation.</p>
<p>The workings of the various bureaus of the department are carefully outlined, particularly in the passport division, which is of great interest to those contemplating a trip abroad. It shows the forms of passports used by the department, the forms of application for a passport, those to be used by a native citizen, by a naturalized citizen, and by persons claiming citizenship through the naturalization of their husband or parent; instructions governing the issuance of passports and a pamphlet (for free distribution) showing the passport regulations of foreign countries.</p>
<p>The administrative functions of the Treasury department may be divided into three branches&#8212;the accounting, the financial and commercial. The first of these, being purely clerical, cannot be illustrated by an exhibit.</p>
<p>The financial branch of the department is illustrated by a complete set of all the currency issued by the government, from a 10-cent shin-plaster to a ten-thousand-dollar gold note. The process of coining the money of the government is shown by operating a coin press, which has been in constant use in the Philadelphia mint for fifty-two years. It has a capacity of $90,000 per hour, and in coining a silver dollar strikes a blow equal to the weight of 100 tons.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing will exhibit a plate printing press in operation, illustrating the manner in which United States notes are printed.</p>
<p>The Light House establishment exhibit consists in part of one large second-order bivalve lens, weighing over eight tons; one third-order lens, flashing red and white lights alternately, and one fourth-order lens.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">NATIONAL QUARANTINE SERVICE.</head>
<p>The Marine Hospital service's exhibit will be illustrative of the functions of the government in preventing the introduction and spread of epidemic diseases by the establishment of quarantine stations, where all vessels and passengers are examined by trained surgeons, and by the erection of government hospitals for the care and treatment of American and foreign seamen.</p>
<p>The War department exhibit represents four branches of the army, viz.: The quartermaster's, engineer's, ordnance and signal corps departments.</p>
<p>The quartermaster's department exhibits lazy figures, mounted and dismounted, showing the uniforms of officers and men from 1776 to the present date, and that of a Puritan solder of 1620; silken colors or regiments, battalions, armies, corps, divisions and brigades, and a silken guidon of the Seventh cavalry of Custer fame.</p>
<p>The engineer's department exhibits models of the Harlem river improvement, St. Mary's falls canal lock, pontoon bridge apparatus, mortar battery Hell Gate, block house and lift gun battery.</p>
<p>The ordnance department displays a light battery field gun, with carriage and limber complete; Gatling gun, with carriage and limber complete; field mortar and carriage; gun rack, with large collection of ancient and modern guns and revolvers, including those now in use in the army; samples of the different swords, sabers and scabbards used in the army; cavalry and infantryman's complete equipments; armor-piercing shot for eight, ten and twelve-inch rifles; shells for seven-inch Howitzer and five-inch siege guns; sample boards of fuses and ammunition, both reloading and non-reloading.</p>
<p>The signal corps exhibit includes the various apparatus used for day and night signaling.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">MODELS OF ARMORED VESSELS.</head>
<p>The exhibit of the United States Navy department is assembles especially to show the present status of the navy. There is a full-sized model of the military mast of the gunboat Helena. This mast carries two military tops, in each of which are mounted two one-pound rapid-firing guns. On the platform, between the tops, a 30,000-candle power searchlight is mounted.</p>
<p>Leaving the mast, the first exhibit in the Navy department space is a full-sized model of a battleship's anchor, weight 14,000 pounds, attached to which is a short section of two and one-half inch chain cable, with club link and shackle.</p>
<p>Following the ship models will be found a Howell and a Whitehead torpedo, and a main deck torpedo gun, used in firing Whitehead torpedoes. Adjacent to the torpedo gun is placed a full-sized half section model of a thirteen-inch rifle. On line with bore of gun is a rough painting illustrating the penetration of a thirteen-inch projectile, fired with an initial velocity of 2,400 feet per second, at a target consisting of steel, wood, granite and brick.</p>
<p>A nickel model of the Hichborn turret divides the heavier ordnance from machine guns and small arms. These consist of a Gatling gun and its successor, the Colt automatic gun, the latest and most approved adaptation of the navy. This gun fired the same cartridges (caliber six millimeters, about .236 inch) as the new navy rifle, one of which is mounted on a tripod, from which sections of boiler plates showing penetration and efficacy are suspended. In front of this case is displayed a Franklin life buoy suspended from a section of a ship's side.</p>
<p>Following these are seen a propeller blade of the United States steamship Maine and a section of crank shaft of the same vessel; a steam launch engine and its propeller.</p>
<p>A diving suit, with complete equipment of air pump, piping, telephone, etc., stands prominently against the rear wall of this exhibit.</p>
<p>The other seven departments of the government exhibit at Nashville also contain most interesting displays illustrating their several functions.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">WORK FOR THE STATE DIRECTORS.</head>
<p>Only the unregenerate opponents of the Transmississippi Exposition who still cherish hopes of blocking its progress and marring its success, are taking exception to the action of Governor Holcomb in designating his intended appointments to the state exposition directorships before the exposition law has gone into full force and effect. On the other hand, every one who has an interest in the exposition and is anxious that Nebraska shall be creditably represented beside the other states will approve the governor's policy. While it was certainly a shame and an outrage that the exposition bill should have been passed without the emergency clause when ti had more than the necessary two-thirds vote in each house of the legislature, under existing circumstances and in view of the extreme urgency of the case by reason of the limited time available for preliminary work, the governor was fully justified in anticipating the duty imposed on him by law in order to have the objects of the law more effectually secured.</p>
<p>The new state exposition directors have work before them that will keep them busy during their entire terms of office. To accomplish what is expected it will be necessary for them to work in harmony and in conjunction with the directors of the exposition association, and it is gratifying to know that this is their disposition. While the state appropriation will not be available for some months yet there is nothing in the law to prevent the new state directors from organizing at once and agreeing upon a plan of operations. What the people want is the best possible results from the money that has been voted for the state exhibit, and it will be the duty of the state directors to see that good returns are obtained from every dollar spent.</p></div2></div1>

<head type="sub">Members of Woman's Board of Managers Act with Department of Exhibits and Prepare a Classification.</head>
<p>The Women's Board of Managers of the exposition, in conjunction with the Department of Exhibits, has prepared a classification of educational exhibits which within a short time will be sent out to educational centers.</p>
<p>Exhibits will be divided in two classes: General or collective and specific and individual. Under the first class are placed eight groups, as follows: I, public and private schools; 2, education for defective classes; 3, technical schools; 4, special schools; 5, art schools; 6, music; 7, diffusive; 8, miscellaneous.</p>
<p>Under the first group are two sub-divisions consisting of kindergarten work, each of the eight grades of the graded schools, rural schools, high schools, academies, normal schools, colleges and universities.</p>
<p>The second group covers four sub-divisions, viz.: Deaf and dumb, blind, feeble-minded, correction and charities.</p>
<p>Under the third group are five subdivisions as follows: Technological, industrial, manual training, Sloyd work and business colleges.</p>
<p>Group 4, Special schools, covers Indian and parochial schools.</p>
<p>Group 5, Art schools, includes four subdivisions, viz.: Drawing in two classes, form and color; modelling and wood carving.</p>
<p>Group 6, Music, covers everything coming under that classification.</p>
<p>Group 7, Diffusive, includes three subdivisions, viz: Libraries, Chautauqua work and women's clubs.</p>
<p>Under Group 8, Miscellaneous, is placed the comprehensive class, child study.</p>
<p>In order to stimulate interest in the matter of preparing exhibits, the Women's board will institute a prize competition, which will be held about two months before the time for the exposition to open. A large number of prizes will be offered in this competition and any child may compete.</p>
<p>A premium list will be prepared and made public about August 1, and for each subject named in this list there will be on gold medal, twenty silver medals and fifty bronze medals distributed, according to merit. All exhibits winning prizes in this competition will be given space in the educational exhibit at the exposition, so that a double incentive will thus be offered to all competitors. </p>
<p>An entry fee of 25 cents will be charged for each exhibit, but no other charges will be made. A certificate will be attached to each exhibit showing the name, age and residence of the exhibitor and the name of the instructor.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">FORESTRY RESERVATIONS HIS BANE</head>
<head type="sub">Bound to Abrogate the Order of President Cleveland, but Privately Admits His Impotency in This Direction.</head>
    <div3>
<p>WASHINGTON, May 25.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The conference report on the sundry civil bill, carrying $200,000 for the Transmississippi Exposition, was reported to the senate by Senator Allison late this afternoon, the senator giving notice that he would call up the bill tomorrow, or as soon thereafter as possible. Senator Pettigrew, who is greatly incensed against the compromise effected on the forest reservation amendment, giving the president discretionary power to set aside a certain part of the reservations included in President Cleveland's order, intimated that he would oppose the bill and if necessary attempt to defeat the measure if the compromise agreement was insisted upon.</p>
<p>Senator Pettigrew could not be reconciled to the action of the conference committee on the part of the house and senate. He made a strong fight to abrogate the order of President Cleveland so far as the forest reservations are concerned and his aggressive action was largely responsible for the amendment wiping out the whole of the ex-president's sweeping order being inserted in the bill. Now that his work is largely come to naught, he is hot and says he will pursue guerrilla warfare if necessary to have the conference agreement defeated. His peppery manner in asking Senator Allison when he expected to call up the bill showed hos determined Pettigrew is in behalf of certain interests in his state. After the senate adjourned the senior senator from South Dakota admitted that the bill would pass, but not before he had shown up existing conditions.</p></div3>

<head type="sub">HELPS THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<p>Mr. Rosewater, between his attendance upon committee meetings and general conferences of the Postal congress, has found time to put in a good word for the Transmississippi Exposition. Learning that Hon. Thomas Needles of Illinois was holding up the senate bill in the Illinois legislature, appropriating $50,000 for the exposition, he at once began work on Senators Cullom and Mason to induce them to pull Needles off. As a result of his efforts the following telegram went to Needles today:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, May 25.&#8212;Hon. Thomas Needles. Springfield, Ill.: We believe it to be to the interest of Illinois to participate in the Transmississippi Exposition. If you can see your way clear to favor the bill passed by the senate we hope you will make a prompt favorable report and work for its passage.</p>
<ab>W. E. MASON.</ab>
<ab>S. M. CULLOM.</ab>
<p>As Needles is a candidate for a place on the Dawes Indian commission and is being pressed for the place by Mason and Cullom, it is thought this telegram may not be without effect.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="main">WORKING FOR THE EXHIBITS</head>
<head type="sub">EXPOSITION FORCES ARE ORGANIZING</head>
<head type="sub">Agents Appointed in Many Foreign Countries to Urge Representation at Omaha in 1898 at the Transmississippi Show.</head>
<p>The Department of Exhibits of the Transmississippi Exposition is making rapid progress in the matter of organizing its forces of agents who will secure exhibits for the occasion. This is especially true in the case of foreign countries, to which especial attention has been directed. With a very few exceptions, every civilized country from which it is expected to secure exhibits has been assigned to an experienced agent, who is under special instructions to secure extensive exhibits and concessions. The countries for which agents have not yet been secured will be supplied within a short time and attention will then be turned to the states of this country.</p>
<p>The terms on which agents have been secured are regarded as most favorable. All agreements are on a strictly commercial basis and do not contain any provisions for the payment by the exposition of traveling expenses, salary, etc.</p>
<p>Manager Bruce is congratulating himself that he has been able to secure the services of men experienced in exposition work and that the prospect for securing a most desirable class of exhibits through the ability of these agents is most flattering.</p>
<p>Prof. J. H. Gore, the commissioner in charge of the exhibit to be made by the United States government at the Brussels exposition, has been appointed a commissioner of the department by Manager Bruce, and it is expected that he will be of most valuable assistance to the department in securing exhibits. The professor will also visit Stockholm during the exposition there this summer, and will work in the interest of the Transmississippi Exposition. Prof. Gore's wife is a native of Sweden, and has appeared at court, and by reason of this fact, he expects to be of very material assistance in official circles of Stockholm. He has also been authorized to designate agents at Stockholm and Brussels.</p>
<p>Louis Moreau, an experience exposition man, has been engaged as commissioner for France and Belgium, outside of Brussels.</p>
<p>Colonel Murphy, the former agent of the Agricultural department, who achieved fame in connection with American corn, and who is better known as "Corn Meal Murphy," has been appointed commissioner for Sweden, Norway and Denmark.</p>
<p>David Cole of Omaha, who has a number of relatives who are prominent in Ireland, has been appointed commissioner for England, Ireland and Scotland. He will sail for his post within a few days and will open offices in London, Liverpool, Manchester and Dublin for the securing of exhibits and concessions.</p>
<p>For New Zealand and Honolulu J. T. Lowe of this city, an old resident of those countries, has been appointed and will leave for those countries within a few days.</p>
<p>Rev. Powell, a missionary, who has been in Mexico for several years, is the commissioner for that country, and A. W. Cockerton has been appointed commissioner for the Latin countries on the American continents.</p>
<p>Commissioners for Germany and Austria and also for Russia, Finland and other Slavonic countries of southern Europe remain to be appointed, but the department is negotiating with several parties for those positions, and their appointment will probably be announced within a short time. The foreign section will then be well organized and ready for active work, after which attention will be directed to the several states of the United States.</p>
<p>Some of the states are already taking hold of the work, and the matter of promoting interest in the exposition is being actively pushed under the direction of the Department of Exhibits. The next stop will be to appoint agents in each of the states where this has not already been done, and push the work of securing exhibits from these states.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">COMING TO THE EXPOSITION</head>
<head type="sub">SOUTHERNERS APPLYING FOR SPACE</head>
<head type="sub">Alabama is Preparing to Exhibit the Many Products of Its Rich Mines and Its Vast Forests.</head>
<p>The Department of Exhibits of the exposition has received a most flattering application for space in the Mines and Mining and the Forestry buildings from an unexpected source. The state of Alabama is evidently in the field, and the indications are that the western mining states are to be crowded very vigorously by the mining and forestry industries of the south. A letter was received by the department this morning from a special committee appointed by the Alabama Industrial and Scientific society asking for the maximum amount of space in the Mines and Mining and Forestry buildings for an exhibit of the mineral and forestry resources of Alabama. The letter quotes a resolution which was adopted at a recent meeting of the society providing for the appointment of a special committee to consult with Governor Johnston, State Geologist Eugene A. Smith and Agricultural Commissioner Culver in reference to placing a display of the resources of the state at the Transmississippi Exposition. The resolution referred to cites the fact that the state of Alabama did not take the fullest advantage of the opportunities offered by the expositions held at Atlanta and Nashville to display the many industries of the state, and resolving to make amends by making a large exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
<p>The special committee appointed in accordance with this resolution writes that the state will make a liberal exhibit and asks how much space can be allowed them under the rules of the department, and for other data in connection with exhibits. It is stated that the exhibit to be made by the state will consist of coal, coke, red and brown iron ores, bauxite, granite, sandstone, dolomite, limestone, iron pyrites, copper and gold ores, kaolin, roofing slate and a full geological and forestry exhibit.</p>
<p>Another evidence of the interest which the southern states are taking in the Transmississippi Exposition was received this morning by the Department of Exhibits in the shape of a letter from a prominent merchant of New Orleans, who writes that the exposition is the subject of a great deal of favorable comment in that section and he asks a number of pertinent questions regarding the making of exhibits, etc.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">SEWERS FOR EXPOSITION GROUNDS.</head>
<head type="sub">Bids on Material Will Be Invited at Once.</head>
<p>The next step to be taken on the exposition grounds will be the construction of a system of sanitary sewerage. A sewer will be laid in Pinkney street on the south, and a similar sewer on the north side of the Kountze tract. These sewers will be of a temporary nature unless the owners of property abutting upon the exposition grounds will agree to bear a part of the expense, in which case the sewers will be of such a size and elevation as will allow of their being used by the abutting property. They will be sanitary sewers only, and will not be calculated to act as storm water sewers.</p>
<p>Both of these sewers will be connected with the 36-inch main sewer now in Twenty-fourth street. The connecting sewer will be twenty-four inches in diameter, and this portion will be constructed at once for the purpose of draining the lagoon now being dredged. The lagoon has got to the point where it becomes an immense pond whenever it rains, and several days delay i caused by reason of the fact that the water cannot escape. The 24-inch sewer will be constructed as soon as possible for the purpose of obviating this difficulty. This portion of the sewer will be built by the Department of Buildings and Grounds in order

<pb n="171" xml:id="TMISB02-171"/>



to avoid the delay required by advertising for bids. The sewer will extend from Twenty-fourth street to the west end of the lagoon, being but a few hundred feet. Bids for material will be called for at once, and the work of construction will be pushed as fast as possible.</p>
<p>The 24-inch sewer will also be used to empty lagoons whenever this becomes necessary in order to draw off stagnant water and keep the lagoons purified.</p>
<p>The construction of the remainder of the sanitary sewer system will be done by contract. Bids for this work will be called for early in June. Unless the abutting property owners join in the expense of constructing this portion of the sewerage, the pipe will be placed in a shallow trench and will be removed after the exposition is over.</p>
<p>It is expected that the lagoon will take care of the storm water which falls on the exposition grounds and the drainage will be arranged accordingly.</p>
<p>The system of water supply for the exposition grounds and buildings will not be finally determined until the artesian well is completed. It is confidently expected that this well and, possibly, others will supply the lagoon with all the water that will be needed, but it is the present intention to supply the buildings, etc., with water taken from the supply pipes of the Omaha Water company. If the artesian well should prove to be a failure it will be necessary to have large supply pipes from the mains of the water company and this matter will, therefore, be allowed to rest until the result of the well driver's work is known.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">DENIAL OF A STREET RUMOR.</head>
<head type="sub">No Truth in the Report that Employment Agencies Furnish Men.</head>
<p>The <choice><sic>ovoer-</sic><corr>over-</corr></choice>supply in the labor market has caused a large number of the wildest kind of rumors regarding the employment of labor on the exposition. The latest report is to the effect that no laborers are being employed expect through a local employment agency and that all applicants for work are told to go to this agency and make application.</p>
<p>At exposition headquarters this story was met with a flat and positive denial. Superintendent of Construction Geraldine states very positively that there was not a word of truth in the report. He said the exposition had only twelve men employed on the grounds and these men were employed after a careful investigation to establish the fact that they were residents of Omaha, married men with families and in need of work. He said no man had been employed through a labor agency and that no such means will be used in employing men for the exposition authorities.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">ENTHUSIASTIC OVER EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">Judge Groff of California Consults with the Directory.</head>
<p>Judge L. A. Groff of Los Angeles, Cal., is in the city for a few days, the guest of C. S. Montgomery. He is here on a professional errand, to look after some private property and to consult with the exposition directory regarding the exhibit of southern California. He is enthusiastic over the prospects of the exposition and is willing to do all in his power to promote its success.</p>
<p>Judge Groff was a district judge here, sitting on the bench with Judges Wakeley, Doane and Hopewell. For eight years, 1879-1887, he was the law partner of Mr. Montgomery. In the spring of 1887 Governor Thayer appointed him to the bench. He served out the term for which he was appointed and then was selected by the people to the same position. He was appointed by ex-President Harrison to be commissioner of the government's general land office. He discharged the duties of this office with great credit, but resigned shortly before the close of the Harrison administration. Instead of returning to Omaha from Washington he went to Los Angeles, where he has since resided.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles Judge Groff occupies a prominent position. He is one of the leading lawyers there and he is a director of the Commercial club. Concerning his interest in the exposition the following was published in a Los Angeles newspaper just before his departure:</p>
<p>Judge L. A. Groff, who starts for Omaha this evening on matters pertaining to his own business affairs, is incidentally going to care for the interests of the Chamber of Commerce while in that city. Judge Groff is an old resident of Omaha and acquainted with most of the officers concerned in the Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898, all of which puts him in a position to gain important concessions for southern California as to space in the coming exposition. It is perhaps worth mentioning that the chamber formulated a bill which was presented to the last legislature asking that the state of California make appropriation for an exhibit at this exposition. Although this bill, along with all others from the same source, was tabled, there is no law forbidding southern California to have an exhibit in the Transmississippi Exposition which shall be all her own, and this she intends to do.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">Exposition Stock Certificates.</head>
<p>The special committee, composed of Messrs. Wattles, Lindsey and Wakefield, appointed at the meeting of the executive committee yesterday afternoon to look after the preparing of stock certificates to be issued to subscribers of exposition stock, has taken this matter up for consideration and is prepared to receive suggestions from everybody regarding the general form and design of such certificates. It is desired to make these certificates a souvenir of the exposition and thing to be preserved among the family archives and for that reason the committee desires to learn the general sentiment as to the design of the certificate. There are bout 7,000 stockholders in the exposition association and each of these will be entitled to a certificate upon the payment of the full amount of his subscription.</p></div2>

<p>Representative Mercer and Mr. Rosewater will call at the State department in the morning in reference to extending to representatives of the United States in foreign countries invitations to be transmitted to the several governments to which they are accredited to participate in the Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha next year. Up to this time these invitations have not been received at the State department. There has been considerable wonderment on the part of the officials that the president and secretary of the Exposition company should have failed to present these invitations along the lines laid down by the Atlanta and Nashville expositions, which must necessarily be a precedent so far as form and manner of transmission are concerned. Mr. Rosewater, it is understood is authorized on the part of the Exposition company and as chairman of the Bureau of Publicity, to represent these letters for transmission to ambassadors, ministers, consuls and diplomatic officers generally throughout the world to induce foreign countries to exhibit at Omaha next year.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Formal Invitations to Take Part in the Transmississippi and International Exposition Sent Out at Last.</head>
    <div3>
<p>WASHINGTON, May 27.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Congressman Mercer and Mr. Rosewater had an interview with the State department and formally presented for transmission to American representatives in foreign countries invitations to be presented to the rulers of nations, inviting them to participate in the Transmississippi and International Exposition. Third Assistant Secretary of State Thomas W. Cridler, recently promoted from the position of chief clerk of the diplomatic bureau, who has had charge of all diplomatic matters growing out of the expositions at Chicago, Atlanta and Nashville, will have a like connection with the Transmississippi Exposition. Secretary Cridler said to the representatives from Omaha that they would go farther in calling the attention of American officials abroad to the Transmississippi Exposition than he did either for Atlanta or Nashville, the law empowering the government to make an exhibit at Omaha being much more explicit than in the other cases mentioned. </p>
<p>The letter of invitation to foreign rulers is general in character, setting forth the vastness of the area covered by the Transmississippi section and places the population at 16,000,000. Invitations are directed to the rulers of <choice><sic>Corea</sic><corr>Korea</corr></choice>, Greece, Persia, Netherlands, <choice><sic>Roumania</sic><corr>Romania</corr></choice>, Portugal, Austria, <choice><sic>Servia</sic><corr>Serbia</corr></choice>, Belgium, Italy, Great Britain, Germany, Japan, Denmark, China, Siam, Turkey, Spain, Switzerland, France, Sweden and Norway, countries in which the government of the United States maintains diplomatic officers. These invitations are signed by President Wattles of the exposition corporation, and are written upon official paper of the association. They will be accompanied by the rules adopted by the Treasury department for the admission of goods for exhibition purposes duty free, and also by copies of the act on the part of congress, appropriating $200,000 for purposes of the government exhibit. These, together with the announcement of the State department, will make a formidable package for delivery to potentates and rules of the world. Assistant Secretary Cridler says that he would probably have his instructions to diplomatic officers ready for signature by Secretary Sherman tomorrow or next day, and that the whole matter would be ready to go out by the next steamer. </p></div3>

General Grosvenor's statement, largely circulated during the past few days, that the senate amendment was directly in favor of the Sugar trust, was emphatically denied today by Chairman Aldrich to the editor of The Bee. Senator Aldrich stated that neither Havemeyer nor Searles had anything to do with the making of the sugar schedule as reported, and that no member of the Sugar trust ever appeared before the committee as to the ad valorem duty embodied in the amendment, he defended it strongly, stating that it was the only thing that could be done to properly take care of some of the lower grades.</p>

<p>State Senator Shurtleff of Utah, vice president for his state and one of the commissioners, is in the city, on his return home from the east, and has been in conference with the exposition managers. He says that as soon as he reaches home the commission will be organized. The exhibit from Utah, he says, will be chiefly mineral, although the fruit industry will not be neglected, and pains will also be taken to open the eyes of the people as to the amount of manufacturing that is going on in that state. The mineral exhibit made at the World's fair is still intact and on permanent display at the State university. The whole of it, Senator Shurtleff says, will be available, but it will be vastly improved before being again sent eastward. Don McGuire, who collected it in the first place, is already at work promoting the exhibit for the Trans-Mississippi exposition, and Mr. Benyon is giving his time to the horticultural feature. The appropriation made by the state, in amount $8,000, does not represent the whole amount that will be spent on the Utah display. it is certain that it will be supplemented by county appropriations and by the contributions of companies and private parties.</p>

<head type="sub">MR. KIMBALL RETURNS.</head>
<p>Thomas R. Kimball of the firm of Walker &amp; Kimball, supervising architects, returned yesterday from Nashville, where he and his partner went to inspect the Tennessee Centennial exposition.</p>
<p>Mr. Walker went on after spending a day there to Boston, stopping at Washington to confer with the government supervising architect's office with regard to the government building at the Trans-Mississippi exposition. Mr. Walker took with him a sketch of the government building which he had prepared, and a telegram states that he had a very satisfactory interview.</p>
<p>At Nashville Mr. Kimball was received most cordially by the officers of the exposition, who extended every courtesy to him, and he was met with like cordiality by the architects of the city, and especially by Colonel W. C. Smith, who had made himself famous by reproducing on the grounds the parthenon of Athens. Mr. Kimball says he was very much impressed with this work, which he regards as one of the most eminent architectural achievements of the last decade. The building is an exact copy in every particular, even to the old marble tinge. This latter was an interesting point to Mr. Kimball, who says that the experiment shows that a tint can be imparted to staff. All the buildings of the Trans-Mississippi exposition will have this same old marble tint.</p>
<p>"I got," said Mr. Kimball, "many valuable suggestions as to details of construction, and have learned where we can economize in the building very much. I was well pleased with the architecture of all the buildings at Nashville, and was most favorably impressed with the exposition as a whole. It is surpassing what the visitors expected, and the expressions of approval that come from all sides are, of course, very gratifying to the management. It is a great show, which everybody ought to see. In the line of Vanity Fair attractions, the gigantic see-saw is the greatest success, and is exceedingly popular. Another fine feature is the interior decoration of the agricultural building in agricultural products. Much of the work is splendidly executed and makes magnificent impression."</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">WALLACE'S VISIT.</head>
<p>The Nashville American, in speaking about the visit of Commissioner Wallace of this city to the Centennial exposition, says: "George G. Wallace of Omaha is in the city in the double capacity of a commissioner to the Tennessee Centennial from Omaha and as a representative of the Trans-Mississippi exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898.</p>
<p>"The Omaha and Nebraska people generally are much interested in the centennial, as it comes so near in character and time to their enterprise of like nature. They hope to profit by the experience of the centennial directory, and it is part of Mr. Wallace's errand here to gather all he can that will aid the management of the big western show next year.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wallace is enthusiastic in praise of the centennial, and deems it remarkable that one state should accomplish so much as has been done in the exhibition now in progress. He believes that the people of the north and west would be amply repaid by a visit to the centennial, not only in what they would learn of the south's resources, but for the opportunity that would be afforded them to get acquainted with the people of the south, and learn experimentally that they are 'bone of their bone and flesh of their flesh.' Mr. Wallace sees much in the historical setting which gives the Tennessee centennial added interest, and believes that this halo of history has not been brought to the attention of northern people as much as it should be to make them interested in and desirous of seeing the exposition.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wallace is, of course, full of the great enterprise which will make Omaha a name in every mouth during 1898&#8212;the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition. Twenty-four states and territories, including all that board empire west of the Mississippi river, will be brought under tribute to this vast exhibition of western resources. The project was started two years ago at a meeting oft he Trans-Mississippi congress, an association of business men, farmers and other interests, with representatives from the various states and territories beyond the Father of Waters, and which meets annually to further the interests of that region. Hon. William J. Bryan was one of the most active promoters of the enterprise.</p>
<p>"If Mr. Wallace could bring it about he would see an exchange of visits of those interested in these two great expositions&#8212;the Tennessee centennial and the Trans-Mississippi exposition&#8212;and proposes to do what he can to secure the visit to Nashville this year of the people of Omaha and the west, hoping that these courtesies will be more than reciprocated next year by the people of Tennessee."</p></div3></div2>

<head type="sub">A Word to the Exposition Executive Committee.</head>
<ab>[The Bee refused to print this letter.]</ab>
<p>MR. EDITOR.&#8212;The question of funds seems to be worrying the directors of the exposition, from the fact that, with their last notice of assessment, issued a few days ago, they especially urge the "prompt payment of assessments as the only way the success of the exposition can be assured."</p>
<p>Did it ever occur to that honorable executive board that they have brought about the "delay" in paying assessments by their display of executive ability in ignoring the interests of the very men whom they are calling upon for funds to promote the exposition project, by persistently employing outside laborers, mechanics, clerks and <choice><sic>artizans</sic><corr>artisans</corr></choice>? Did not our citizens subscribe $400,000 or more, with the expectation that they would reap at least a share of the benefits? Were not the laboring men, wage-earners and those with meager salaries, urged to subscribe by the leading papers and the subscription solicitors, forsooth, because work would be more plentiful, and that every idle man in Omaha would be employed in building up the exposition? and with these inducements did not a large proportion of our citizens subscribe, that "times with them might be improved?" How is it, then, what when additional help is employed by the executive committee he has to come from some other place than Omaha, to secure the situation? No wonder the subscribers, seeing that they have no use for Omaha talent, feel that they can get along without Omaha money and fail to pay their assessments as promptly as desired.</p>
<p>Let that honorable body, if they want "the success of the exposition assured," show a disposition to treat those who have subscribed, or even Omaha citizens, with some degree of respect, and I warrant the assessments will be more promptly paid. The board of directors, or rather the executive board, for many of the directors are not in sympathy with them, will find that their actions are more in the way of the "success of the exposition" than the non-payment of assessments. We subscribers to an enterprise like this, however small our subscriptions, want to see something done that will

benefit our citizens, then we will pay our subscriptions, and that promptly, but when positions are given to men who are not peers to any we have in the city, do you blame us for delaying the payment of our subscriptions?</p>
<p>I remember that both papers of our city urged the small subscriptions first, on the plea that "if the laboring men, mechanics and <choice><sic>artizans</sic><corr>artisans</corr></choice> were not willing to help themselves by helping the exposition, we could not expect men of capital and large subscribers to take an interest." Is it possible that this was done to get the capital, and the capitalists and larger subscribers form a close corporation and freeze out the smaller? If this is the case you will find that the small subscribers will not pay their hard-earned money to see it go to outside parties and reap no benefit themselves, and the exposition cannot succeed without the small subscriptions.</p>
<p>Let the exposition directors, who are thus despising the small subscribers, also remember that Douglas county will not issue bodes for $100,000 to help them keep their Chicago employees and other outside idle men in employment, while our own citizens are left to rustle hard for a living and to raise money to pay off the bonds.</p>
<p>Change your course, gentlemen. Let your high salaried men go back where they belong, and place in their stead Omaha men, many of whom are more capable, an the "success of the exposition is assured."</p>
<p>There are many things making up the past record of the executive board that are doing more to retard the raising of funds for the "great show" than the failure to pay assessments that I will not mention at this writing. "A word to the wise is sufficient." I am not giving utterance in the foregoing to my personal feelings along, for I know I voice the sentiment of many subscribers to the Trans-Mississippi Exposition.</p>

<p>Will you please tell your readers why Gov. Holcomb appointed a republican "capitalist" as state director of the Transmississippi exposition? Was it because all the other directors in <choice><sic>D ouglas</sic><corr>Douglas</corr></choice> county were gold-bug republican wheel-horses and the governor desired to make it unanimous by appointing a director of state funds in harmony with and of the same political faith as the original directory?</p>

<p>[Our correspondent should ask us something easy. The governor has done some strange things, among the rest the appointment of Martin Dunham. Perhaps the governor wishes to assist in the republican recovery of the state. If that is the purpose he has done very well, indeed. if this reason is not satisfactory to our correspondent, he had better "ask Maret," the governor's secretary.

    <div3>
<p>One of the first things discussed at the meeting of the executive committee of the exposition yesterday afternoon was the importance of having plenty of money in the treasury to back up the contracts which are soon to be let for the construction of the main buildings. It was decided to issue the following address:</p>
<p>To Patriots: The time has now arrived when contracts for the main buildings on the exposition grounds must be let, and the advantage of having money enough on hand to meet all obligations is apparent.</p>
<p>There are thousands upon thousands of people in Omaha, Council Bluffs and South Omaha who can afford to subscribe liberally to the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition who have not subscribed at all.</p>
<p>The time of the members of the board of directors is valuable and such time as they can spare is taken up with important and pressing matters relating to the exposition. All are pulling to the one end, viz: Success. If you are not a subscriber, please notify Secretary John A. Wakefield how much stock you will take or donation you will make.</p>
<p>If you are a subscriber, kindly increase your subscription as much as you think you ought to subscribe.</p>
<p>A gigantic enterprise has been understand in very depressed times; the idea is to call attention to western resources and bring more people and money to the west.</p>
<p>People who are familiar with the conditions of the exposition at this time are astonished at the progress made. It is going to be a great success and it is going to open June 1, 1898, and run till November. The public spirit of the people in this vicinity is taking hold of every man, woman and child and all are going to help in every way they can and in no way can they help more than to forward subscriptions now, be cause many architects are at work on plans for the buildings, and very soon contracts will be called for, and then we must have vast sums of money.</p>
<p>Don't call it an exposition gotten up to benefit the executive committee, board of managers or board of directors, because they are all giving their time without one cent of compensation. They are good business men and intend to successfully build an exposition that will be strictly first-class in every department, one that will be memorable and that can be pointed to with pride.</p>
<p>Each putting a shoulder to the wheel and a willingness to push will make the whole immense load move so easily that no one will feel it now, and later on will be rewarded by setting the old-time prosperity renewed, which will have been brought about by a push and a pull of all together. Talk and work for the exposition. Bury all prejudice, narrow ideas and jealousy. The days of small things have passed, but the days of great possibilities are upon us. Only the broad-gauged can see them, but they are here and the exposition is a forerunner.</p>
<p>The great its success the more numerous and great will be the other added plants, packing houses manufactories, wholesale houses, mills, railroads, etc.</p>
<p>Are you all ready? If so, push.</p>

<head type="sub">DR. LEE APPOINTED.</head>
<p>Manager Kirkendall of the department of buildings and grounds brought up the question of the appointment of a medical director for the exposition, and submitted a petition signed by Drs. Crummer, Wilson, Jonas, Somers, Stone, Chadwick, Towne, Peabody, Denise, Aiken, Edmiston, Bridges and several other physicians asking that Dr. E. W. Lee be assigned to the position. The request was granted, the motion providing that Dr. Lee shall report an organization subject to approval and modification by the executive committee. There was but one other application for the place. This was Dr. Lord, who appeared in the course of the afternoon and announced his withdrawal in favor of Lee. Dr. Lee's duties will begin as soon as he returns from the jubilee of the American Medical association at Philadelphia.</p>
<p>On the recommendation of Manager Bruce of the department of exhibits Prof. W. W. Taylor of the state university and superintendent of the farmers' institute of Nebraska, who made superintendent of the combined bureau of agriculture, horticulture, forestry and irrigation. The professor has had extensive experience in this line of work, and in the prosecution of it has attended expositions in various parts of the globe.</p>
<p>In pursuance of the action of the directory in giving the committee authority to purchase five and a half acres of land on the Kountze tract to go with another five and a half acres donated by Herman Kountze to be maintained as a park by the city, the secretary and the manager of the department of buildings and grounds were instructed to secure a deed for the land as soon as the city council should have accepted the proffer by Mr. Kountze and by the exposition association of the land. Mr. Kountze is to receive $15,000 for the land, and he has agreed to turn back to the exposition as a donation $5,000 of it.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">BID FOR CALIFORNIA.</head>
<p>Judge Lewis A. Groff of Los Angeles appeared before the committee on behalf of the chamber of commerce of Los Angeles and of counties and private parties in Southern California to describe what part this section proposed to take in the exposition, and to ask for the most favorable terms possible on space. He said that the proposed exhibit would require several thousand square feet,and would be chiefly of fruits, the material being necessarily renewed perhaps every thirty days. He said that the people whom he represented had taken hold of the exposition in earnest, were anxious to come and would come with a display that would surprise the country.</p>
<p>Chaplain Dr. Butler and Treasurer Fisher of the Thurston Rifles had an audience with the committee to secure co-operation if possible in raising funds with which to send the Rifles to the international drill at San Antonio July 17 to 25, at which place and time the Rifles have been challenged to defend the Galveston cup which the company won at Memphis two years ago.</p>
<p>Dr. Butler made a strong plea. He said that either the company must respond to the challenge or else the trophy so gloriously won must be boxed up and expressed to San Antonio, surrendered by the company whose possession of it indicated that it was the crack military company of the United States. This was a humiliation not to be though of. Dr. Butler urged the co-operation of the exposition management on the ground that the appearance of the company at San Antonio under the circumstances would be a great advertisement of the exposition and would perhaps more than any other one thing create enthusiastic interest in the proposed mobilization of the militia of the United States at Omaha during the exposition year.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">NEEDS THREE THOUSAND.</head>
<p>It was shown that $3,000 would be necessary to take the boys there, and this amount it is proposed to raise by subscription.</p>
<p>What the Rifles desired was that the committee should name a committee to act in conjunction with a committees already appointed by the Commercial club in promoting the raising of the money. The Commercial club committee consists of Messrs. Utt, Chase, Palmer, George and Poppleton. In response to Dr. Butler's appeal Chairman Lindsey named Messrs. Manderson, Lee and Hussie of the directory as the committee asked for.</p>
<p>With regard to securing the meeting next year of the National Educational association it was resolved that the exposition should furnish all the preliminary literature necessary to this end. Taking action on the request made by the Omaha Elks a few days ago that the exposition select a committee of five to go to Minneapolis to labor in conjunction with the delegation

to the grand lodge of Elks in an effort to bring the next meeting of the body to this city in 1898, that it agree to furnish to the local Elks 20,000 admission tickets at reduced rates and that a day be set apart to be known as Elks day at the exposition, the request was granted save with respect to the tickets. it was the sense of the committee that it was inadvisable at this time to agree to furnish under any considerations tickets at reduced rates.</p>
<p>Manager Reed of the department of concessions was authorized to offer a prize of $10 for the person who shall suggest the best name for the midway plaisance of the exposition.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">BARRY ENTHUSIASTIC.</head>
<head type="sub">Heartily in Favor of the Mobilization of Troops at Exposition.</head>
<ab>Special Dispatch to the World-Herald.</ab>
<p>Lincoln, Neb., May 28.&#8212;The discussion of the plan for the mobilization of the militia at Omaha during the progress of the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition next summer is being carried on in army circles to such an extent that special efforts are being made to arrive at the opinions of all the representative men in command of the National guard of the several states. Recently the editor of the Military Gazette wrote to Adjutant General Barry and requested him to give his opinion as to the matter. General Barry has sent the following in reply:</p>
<p>Headquarters Nebraska National Guard, Adjutant General's Office, Lincoln, Neb., May 28.&#8212;Editor Military Gazette, Chicago, Ill.&#8212;Sir: Referring to your letter of April 26 relative to the mobilization of the National guard at Omaha during the exposition, and requesting an expression of my opinion on the matter, I will say that not only myself, but all of the officers of the National guard of this state with whom I have consulted are heartily in favor of the idea, believing that the concentration of the guard of the several states of our great country in a camp of instruction, can, as a matter of course, but result for the very best interests of our citizen soldiers.</p>
<p>The policy of our government has not in the past, nor will it in the future, admit of the keeping of a standing army sufficient to meet a sudden declaration of war. Consequently we must rely upon the organized militia to meet emergencies.</p>
<p>To this end, it is of vast importance that the National guard should receive sufficient support, and instruction in order that it may at all times be ready for mobilization at threatened points. The gathering together if the troops of the different states in camps or instruction carries more with it than the mere routine of drill, guard duty and ceremonies.</p>
<p>The principles of minor tactics can be better exemplified, strategical problems on a large scale can be demonstrated and worked out. Officers learn to know each other, observing the methods of administration, etc., possibly detecting errors, or it may be seeing in the systems of their comrades of other states better methods.</p>
<p>In fact, one might go on and enlarge on this subject until he had matter enough to make a good-sized pamphlet.</p>
<p>While I have expressed myself in favor of the mobilization of the National guard of the United States at Omaha, I must also express the opinion that in order to insure the best results from such joint encampments the present militia law of the United States should be changed so as to give to the general commanding and all subordinate officers full military control, equal to that now exercised by officers of the regular army, and officers of the National guard over their commands within the boundaries of their own states.</p>
<p>The commanding officer of the joint encampment could only command by voluntary agreement, he having no authority by law to issue an order and enforce obedience thereto. The passage of the militia bill prepared at the war department and introduced at the last session of congress would obviate this difficulty. It seems to me there should be not rouble to get such a bill passed by the congress now in session. to bring about an enactment of such a law only required the united efforts of the adjutant generals of the several states, who should call the attention of their congressional delegations to such a measure and urge them to support the same.</p>
<p>I am assured by each member of the Nebraska delegation that such a measure will receive their cordial support. I am very truly yours.</p>

<head type="sub">Nonsubscribers Are Urged to Come Into the Fold, While Others are Asked to Increase Their Subscriptions.</head>
    <div3>
<p>The executive committee of the exposition held its regular meeting yesterday afternoon. The meeting was one of the most protracted which has been held during the progress of the exposition and a large amount of business, largely routine, was disposed of.</p>
<p>One of the principal matters which engaged the attention of the committee was the urgent necessity for accumulating a cash surplus in the treasury in order to be prepared to meet all obligations on building contracts promptly. It was stated during the discussion which ensued upon this matter that the knowledge that the management was in position to pay estimates promptly would have a most important bearing upon the figures made by contractors in making up their bids on the buildings, etc. It also developed that the assessments levied up to this time have been responded to in a fairly reasonable manner, but that the amount paid in and the rate at which payments are being made is not sufficient to meet the obligations which will accrue when the active operation of building commences.</p>
<p>It was therefore decided to issue a letter to the pubic, and the following was produced by Chairman Lindsey and was approved by the committee:</p>
    <p>To Patriots: The time has now arrived when contracts for the main buildings on the exposition grounds must be let, and the advantage of having money enough on hand to meet all obligations is apparent.</p>

<head type="sub">CALIFORNIA TO BE HERE.</head>
<p>Judge Groff, a former resident of Omaha, and how a resident of Los Angeles, Cal., appeared before the committee in the interest of southern California. The judge said the failure of the legislature to make an appropriation for an exhibit by the state had made it necessary for the various counties in the state to take up the matter. He said the Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles ha taken hold of the subject and would enlist the assistance of neighboring counties and communities and would have an exhibit that would be a credit to southern California. He said this exhibit would consist of citrous fruits, raisins, walnuts and the thousands of other products of that fertile section, including minerals, etc. All that the people of that section wanted, the judge said, was a reasonable concession in the way of space, and arrangements regarding transportation that would enable them to change their exhibits as often as the perishable nature of portions of it required.</p>
<p>The committee gave Judge Groff assurance that the people of southern California would be given every consideration and would be welcomed to the exposition.</p>
<p>Rev. S. Wright Butler, chaplain of the Thurston Rifles, and W. L. Fisher, treasurer of the organization, appeared before the committee to ask its assistance in the placing of subscription papers designed to raise funds to send the Rifles to San Antonio, Tex., to defend the championship cup won by the Rifles at Memphis. Rev. Mr. Butler presented the matter to the committee, explaining that it was necessary for the Rifles to appear at the San Antonio drill and defend the cup against all comers or sent the cup there by express and thus acknowledge either that the company was lacking in military spirit or that the citizens of Omaha did not take enough interest in the company to assist it to attend the drill. The speaker said it would cost about $3,000 to defray the expenses of the trip and provide the company with badly needed dress uniforms. He said the only thing asked of the exposition management wast he moral support of the movement to solicit subscriptions and its assistance in placing these papers in offices, stores, etc. In return for this he said the company would advertise the exposition by distributing printed matter, and in other ways.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">TO HELP THURSTON RIFLES.</head>
<p>A committee of three was appointed in accordance with this request to co-operate with a like committee appointed by the Commercial club. The chair appointed General Manderson, Dr. E. W. Lee and J. H. Hussie as this committee.</p>
<p>The matter if assisting in securing the annual convention of the National Educational association for 1898 was then taken up and the Department of Promotion was authorized to co-operate by furnishing literature, etc.</p>
<p>The annual convention of the Elks was also taken up for action and it was decided to send a committee to Minneapolis to assist in securing the convention for Omaha next year. It was also decided to set apart a day during the meeting in Omaha as an "Elks' day."</p>
<p>Managers Reed and Kirkendall were authorized to close up the purchase of the five and one-half acres of land in the Kountze tract and the donation of a similar tract by Mr. Kountze, these two pieces to constitute a public park to be known as Kountze park. The committee was also authorized to pay Mr. Kountze the purchase price of this land, $15,000, and to accept from him the donation of $5,000 to the exposition. Messrs. Reed and Kirkendall will endeavor to hasten the action of the city council on the resolution authorizing the park board to accept this land as a public ark, and thereby expedite the work of the park board on the improvement of this park.</p>
<p>A long petition was received from a number of the physicians of Omaha asking the appointment of Dr. E. W. Lee as medical directors of the exposition. There were a large number of signatures to the petition, and while it was being considered the only other candidate for the position, Dr. Lord, notified the committee that he would withdraw his application.</p>
<p>Dr. Lee was thereupon appointed, and it was further provided that he should report to the committee a plan of organization for a medical staff for the exposition, which was to be approved by the committee.</p>
<p>Manager Bruce of the Department of Exhibits announced the appointment of Prof. F. W. Taylor, superintendent of the Farmer' institute at the Nebraska State University.</p></div3></div2>

    <head type="main">RETURNS FROM NASHVILLE</head>
<head type="sub">KIMBALL ON THE TENNESSEE EXPOSITION</head>
<p>Pleased with the Style and Architecture of the Buildings&#8212;Walker Confers with Government Authorities on Federal Building.</p>
<p>the supervising architects of the Transmississippi Exposition, Walker &amp; Kimball, spent four days of last week in Nashville, visiting the Tennessee Centennial exposition and acquiring information in the line of their work. Mr. Kimball has returned to Omaha. Mr. Walker went east from Nashville, via Washington. Mr. Kimball stated this morning that Mr. Walker took with him to Washington the suggestions of a design which he intended offering to the supervising architect as a means of expediting the work of planning the federal building. A telegram from Mr. Walker this morning contained the information that his interview with the government authorities had been entirely satisfactory. </p>

<pb n="175" xml:id="TMISB02-175"/>



<p>Mr. Kimball is very enthusiastic over the display made by the Nashville exposition. He says the promoters have accomplished wonders and have secured an enormous result for the money they have expended. Mr. Kimball was especially delighted with the Parthenon, the art building of the Nashville exposition being modeled exactly on the lines of the celebrated temple of Athens on the Acropolis at Athens, even the marble of which the original was built being reproduced in staff. The charming tint of the old marble, resembling the rich hue of old ivory, has been produced in staff and an exact facsimile of the finest example of the pure Doric order of architecture the world has ever seen stands on a slight elevation, forming, as Mr. Kimball says, a study in architecture which inspires every admirer of the beautiful in art and for which the architect, Colonel W. C. Smith of Nashville, deserves a monument.</p>
<p>The Parthenon shelters the art exhibit of the Tennessee exposition and the interior cella is constructed of brick, making the structure fireproof. The practical feature of this building, from Mr. Kimball's point of view, is the fact that it is a proof that staff may be given a tint.</p>
<p>It has been the intention of the architects of the Transmississippi Exposition to avoid having the staff white, and thereby having a city of dazzling whiteness, disagreeable to the eyes in more than on way, but just how to accomplish this has been a mooted question. The Chicago people expended thousands of dollars in unsuccessful attempts to stain the staff and experts pronounced it an impossible feat. Painting it was found to be very expensive, but the result attained in the Parthenon solves the whole difficulty. By the use of yellow ochre and brown in the mixing of the staff and old marble tint was imparted, giving the whole a rich, creamy tint, which, Mr. Kimball says, is very pleasing to the eye and artistic in the general result.</p>
<p>As a result of this discovery the staff covered buildings of the Transmississippi Exposition will be given a creamy tin which will add greatly tot he richness of the general effect and soften the outlines of the architecture.</p>
<p>The skylights of the exposition buildings will be made of a newly invented translucent fabric, which admits a soft amber light and is very much cheaper than glass, while not being subject to breakage from the settling of any part of the building or from hail or stones. This fabric is in use at the Nashville exposition and Architect Kimball says it is pronounced very satisfactory by the architects there.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">ARCHITECTS SEND ON SKETCHES.</head>
<head type="sub">Drawings of the Manufacturers' Building Are Received.</head>
<p>The sketches of the Manufactures building have been received by the supervising architects. The architect of this building is S. S. Beman of Chicago, and his drawings are the first to be received. HE sends a front elevation, showing the north side of the building, the side facing the lagoon, the elevation of the ends, and a plan showing the interior arrangement and construction. These drawings will not be made public until after the drawings of the Machinery and Electricity buildings are received from Dwight Perkins of Chicago, these two buildings being twins and the supervising architects desiring to make sure that they are n harmony before giving them out to the public. The drawings for the manufactures building show a stately structure of imposing appearance, with a wide colonnade extending along the entire front.</p></div2>

<p>David R.

    <div3>
<p>NASHVILLE, Tenn., May 24.&#8212;(Special Correspondence of The Bee.)&#8212;"What do yo' all think of ouah big show?" is the question I have had to answer repeatedly since my arrival on the grounds of the Tennessee Centennial exposition, a few days ago. I am pleased to say that I can give a reply that is in every respect satisfactory to the questioner. The "Centennial," as it is termed here for short, is a remarkable evidence, not only of the resources of the south, but of the determined perseverance, against almost overwhelming obstacles, of the people of Tennessee, and particularly of Nashville, in bringing this enterprise to a successful accomplishment. Some account of what our southern neighbors have done in bringing about this exposition will certainly help stimulate the people of the great transmississippi region in bringing to a successful issue their great exposition in 1898. In fact, no affair of this kind ever held offers to us so many suggestions and so much of experience by which we may profit as does this Tennessee centennial. The World's fair, gigantic, supplied with vast sums of money, commemorating an event of world-wide interest, was shortly followed by the Atlanta exposition, which profited in a measure by the experiences of its big predecessor. The Tennessee people have even more profited by the great Chicago show, and have also made use of the Atlanta affair. Now our Transmississippi Exposition should, and will, gain much from a study of the methods used in all three, but especially in the plans adopted by this last one, held only a year prior to our own.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">ONE HUNDRED YEARS A STATE.</head>
<p>The purpose of the Tennessee centennial, as its name indicates, is to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the admission of the state of Tennessee to the union. As a matter of fact the date of President Washington's proclamation declaring Tennessee a state&#8212;the sixteenth&#8212;was June 1, 1796, and it was intended at first to have the exposition opened upon that date. But the plans grew, needing more time to materialize them, and the date of opening was postponed until September 1, 1896, and the thought was to hold it but 100 days. then it was found that it was impossible to get in readiness to great an enterprise in so short a time, and it was not until May 1, 1897, that the formal opening exercises were held, with, I am told, 4,000 men still at work upon the grounds, and the time of its continuance extended to six months. Even yet, after being open to the public twenty days, there is much undone, and many workmen still busily engaged in getting exhibits and grounds in order.</p>
<p>To carry on this magnificent affair, the people of Nashville have subscribed, and paid in, $530,000, including only two large subscriptions&#8212;railroad&#8212;of $25,000 each. Everybody subscribed; business men willingly bent their backs to the burden; clerks, bookkeepers, laborers, cheerfully contributed from their small incomes. All this was done in the two years just past when Nashville was suffering as severely from the hard times as Omaha or any other city of the country. I am credibly informed that in the past five years something like $15,000,000 have dropped out of sight in this city in the failure of banks and other financial institutions. All banks but two were forced to close their doors during the panic, although a number have since been reopened. In addition to all this, it should be remembered that Nashville does not claim over 100,000 population, probably has not over 85,000, and of these fully one-third are colored people from whom little was expected or received. </p>
<p>In view of all these circumstances it must be admitted that Nashville has not only made a remarkable showing, but has set a worthy example to Omaha to do much better than she has yet done. In addition to the money raised by the city of Nashville, the United States congress appropriated $130,000, and the legislature of Tennessee $50,000. Comparatively little was received from other cities and counties of the state, and that was contributed for special purposes, as county or city buildings, or exhibits, and none was given by other states. The total resources did not reach $750,000. One cannot but be impressed with the fact that this amount of money must have been used with remarkable shrewdness and economy, as the result of its expenditure gradually unfolds itself before the eyes in the great buildings and beautiful grounds.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">GENTLE SLOPES AND FOREST TREES.</head>
<p>The location is attractive&#8212;the most so of any exposition since the Philadelphia Centennial, which had about it the landscape of beautiful Fairmount park. A well known and skillful writer, in making a few comparison between the World's fair and Tennessee Centennial, says: "Chicago, on sunny days, was a study in blue and white and gold; Nashville is a study in green and white and gold." What the World's fair lacked in grass and trees and terraces, it made up in vast stretches of water, of plazas and endless buildings; what the Tennessee Centennial lacks in these, it makes up in 200 acres of gentle slopes, with splendid forest trees, long reaches of terraces. And the diversity of sweeping hillside and pretty valleys. While not so large, nor so numerous, of course, as the buildings at the Chicago fair, the Nashville buildings constructed after the same manner, are more artistic, and leave, with their beautiful surroundings, a delightful picture upon the mind of the visitor. The site is a natural park, about two miles from the center of the city, reached by three electric and one steam car line, the electric lines carrying the visitor through the most attractive residence district.</p>
<p>But a feature of the Tennessee Centennial, which give it an especial interest over any of its predecessors, unless it should be the Philadelphia Centennial, is its historical setting. Of this, the World's fair was of necessity barren. It was of the earth, earthy. Held in a city whose god is Mammon, the uppermost thought was to display that which produced wealth, the products of wealth, or which in some way would help in money getting. Its treasury of art even were associated with the thought of their vast value in dollars and cents. But these could be nothing in the surroundings that brought to mind events of historic interest outside of the one great fact of America's discovery, and even this was buried amid the flaunting evidences of this generation's wealth and power and plenty.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">MID HISTORIC SCENES.</head>
<p>The thought is all different at the Tennessee Centennial. The very central building on the grounds, although it does not seem to have been so intended, is a beautiful and graceful structure devoted to History,and filled with the relics and mementoes of a bygone century. Stand upon the steps of the Parthenon, filled with its treasures of art, and you look into the city, where, upon its rocky knoll, stands like a grim sentinel amid and above the modern day traffic and noise and smoke, the historic state house, where scenes of great moment to the entire nation have been enacted. There, but a few rods away from the beautiful grounds surrounding the capitol, is the stately old mansion of James Knox Polk, while he and his queenly wife lie buried on the pretty eastern terrace of the capitol grounds, an inscription upon the simple stone vault that marks their grave, telling the world that "the beauty of virtue was illustrated in his life; the excellence of Christianity was exemplified in his death. His life was devoted to the public service. He was elevated successfully to the first places in the state and federal governments. A member of the general assembly; a member of congress, and the chairman of the most important congressional committees; speaker of the house of representatives; governor of Tennessee, and president of the United States." From the higher points of the Centennial grounds, upon a clear day, may be seen "The Hermitage," Andrew Jackson's old home, twelve miles away, and where is his last resting place, as sacredly guarded and cared for by thew omen of Tennessee as is Mount Vernon upon the banks of the Potomac by the women of Washington. Indeed one cannot but be impressed with the reverence and respect given by the people of Tennessee to the memory of Jackson. His statues, his portraits, his name, his letters, the relics of his lifetime, are met with throughout the exposition and the city. Tennessee is proud of the fact that she has been the mother of three presidents, for she also gave to the country Andrew Johnson, whose grave is at Greenville, in another part of the state.</p>
<p>All about, within sight and walking distance of this beautiful collection of the evidences of an age of peace, are the hills of Nashville, once crowned with forts, the scenes of terrible strife during the civil war. As one walks the streets, visits the capitol, or the more venerable buildings, he realizes that he is treading in the footsteps of brave men who have their lives a generation ago for the cause they loved. The National cemetery near by is the last resting place of 16,500 federal soldiers, more than one-fourth of whom are unknown. Upon every hand one has those fierce days called to mind, and hourly his soul is thrilled within him as some sport or landmark or grassy mound slowly losing its semblance to fort or rifle pit calls to mind deeds of glory and loyalty that were done in the name of God and home and native land.</p>
<p>Yes, the historical setting of the Tennessee Centennial is by no means its least interesting feature. GEORGE G. WALLACE.</p></div3></div2>

    <head type="sub">DRAWINGS OF MINING BUILDING.</head>
<head type="sub">Sketches Presented by Architect Humphreys of Denver.</head>
<p>To John J. Humphreys of Denver, the architect of the Mines and Mining building of the exposition, belongs the honor of being the second most complete his drawings and deliver them to the supervising architect. The complete drawings were received by Walker &amp; Kimball this morning.</p>
<p>The drawings submitted by Mr. Humphreys show a building which ears in every line the impress of the artistic. It is designed along free classic lines of the ornamental Doric order, with a strong central motive bearing the name of the building and surmounted by idealic groups of statuary. The ends take the form of monumental pavilions with dome-like roofs. The roof of the building proper is flat, decorated with a balcony extending entirely around the structure, and statuary and flying bunting is freely used to enhance the artistic effect. The frieze of the building is ornamented by the names of the celebrated chemists, mineralogist, metallurgists and scientists. </p>
<p>To enhance the spectacular effect of the whole court, Mr. Humphreys has designed his building in such a way that the entablature is broken on the module lines, so that upon looking down the lagoon the effect is produced of plane behind plane, greatly increasing the magnitude of the whole and adding materially to the artistic result.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">HOUSE PASSES EXPOSITION BILL</head>
<head type="sub">Illinois Appropriates Forty-Five Thousand for a Building.</head>
<p>SPRINGFIELD, Ill., June 2.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The house today passed the senate, or Crawford, bill to provide for the participation of the state of Illinois in the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898. The bill appropriates $45,000 to be used for the purpose of erecting a state building at the exposition. The building is to be kept open at all times when the exposition is open and used as the headquarters of the citizens of Illinois and their friends who are visiting the fair.</p>
<p>In addition, the governor is authorized to appoint a commission to be known as the Illinois Transmississippi and International Exposition commission, which shall consist of twenty members and shall have power to devise and execute plans for the display of all exhibits from Illinois as may, in the opinion of the commission, be advisable and to secure, encourage and assist exhibitors to make exhibits, and shall have general direction of all matters connected with these exhibits. The members of the commission are to serve without compensation are to serve without compensation, but each member will be allowed his necessary expenses, but the expense must not aggregate over $5,000. At the close of its service the commission must make, to the governor, a report of its proceedings, including a list of all disbursements.</p>
<p>Chicago members of both branches of the assembly took a deep interest in the measure and it met with little opposition, except from country members with pronounced ideas of economy. A number of Chicago manufacturers have already expressed their intention of exhibiting, and there is no doubt that the state will be well represented.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">FOR AN EXPOSITION BUILDING.</head>
<head type="sub">Eastern Star Delegates Decide to Erect a Structure.</head>
<p>Yesterday afternoon and evening sessions of the Order of the Eastern Star, held at Masonic hall, were devoted to transacting the yearly business of the order. An unusual amount of work had been performed by the visiting delegates to the grand chapter this year. The majority of it is in connection with the secret workings of the society and will not be made public.</p>
<p>Last evening memorial exercises were conducted in the hall, Mrs. Fannie Hamilton, grand Martha of Dawson chapter, Lexington, conducing the services. The latter portion of the evening was devoted to exemplifying the rituals of the order for the benefit of the numerous visiting officers throughout the state. It was decided to hold the next grand chapter in Omaha during the Transmississippi year to allow the visiting delegates the opportunity to visit the big show. The date of holding the chapter will be June 21.</p>
<p>At this morning's session the body passed a resolution to set aside an appropriation for the erection of an Eastern Star building on the exposition grounds. Subordinate chapters throughout the state are asked to donate what they can to a fund to be used for this purpose. The building will be a headquarters for the members, and will be fitted up for their convenience.</p></div2>

    <head type="main">DIRT FLYING EVERY WAY</head>
<head type="sub">Work on the Exposition Grounds Takes on a New Activity Daily.</head>
<head type="sub">Job of Laying Down a Sewer System for the Kountze Tract is Commenced.</head>
<head type="sub">Approach to the Sherman Avenue Viaduct About Completed&#8212;Well is Down to Near 300 Foot Mark.</head>
<p>Almost every day sees an increase of activity on the exposition grounds, and the promise of the management is that this will continue until the gates open one year from yesterday.</p>
<p>The liveliest scene, of course, is on the Kountze tract, where the main buildings are to be located. The graders have been at work there for some time, as well as the artesian well drillers and the pile drivers, and yesterday putting in the sewer system for this part of the grounds was begun. Mr. Dailey will be foreman of the job. He has a score of men at work. The first object will be to put down the twenty-four-inch sewer, which is to drain the canal. It will run from Twenty-fourth street, in a northeasterly direction, to the west end of the canal. The urgency about getting this line laid first is due to the fact that the canal is now at such a depth that a heavy rain would leave enough water in the excavation to seriously delay the work, if some outlet were not provided. After this is done the fifteen-inch pipe will be laid along the southern line of the grounds, and then the smaller pipes along the northern line.</p>
<p>The operations of the men are extending both skyward and the other way. The pile driving and planking at the east end of the tract, which is to make an approach for the ornamental viaduct over Sherman avenue, is almost completed and the dirt, too, is about all in place. The well drillers are putting in more casing. Their bits are now striking 250 feet under ground. At present they are going through soft clay.</p>
<p>The Twentieth street boulevard has been closed because the graders are now cutting deep across it. A part of the street is left which, with more dirt piled on it, will form the little island which it is intended shall be one of the beauty spots of the grounds.</p>
<p>By the time the grades are through, and possibly before, the architects will be ready to start on the administration arch.</p>
<p>For several days men have been at work clearing the bluff tract of dead vegetable matter, such as weeds and cornstalks, and of rubbish.</p>
<p>The old fair grounds are fast becoming bare of buildings. The old floral hall is on wheels moving southward and has been stopped on the Twentieth street boulevard near Pinckney street until the fence is opened to let it through.</p>
<p>P. M. Price of the Nebraska Moline Plow company yesterday morning handed Manager Bruce an application for 1,000 feet of space for an exhibit.</p>
<p>John J. Humphreys of Denver has sent in his plans for the mines and mining building. It is a rich, Roman Doric style, with rusticated wall surfaces and large, light bays, divided into screen work. In the friezes will be the names of eminent metallurgists and scientists, and the center will be surmounted and surrounded by symbiotic statues. Entrances will be at the ends as well as the center.</p>
<p>Plans for the manufacturers building by S. S. Beman of Chicago show a structure of the Ionic order. The most marked feature is a high domed center, with a covered way in front, which is to have decorative painting on the inside.</p>
<p>Both buildings will be arranged so as to fly plenty of flags and bunting.</p></div2>

This was accomplished during the final days of the bill's consideration, Senator Thurston and the committee on appropriations having manipulated the insertion of the words "to be immediately available," that the exposition might have the benefit of all thereto accruing, so far as the government was concerned. Now that the amount can be used at any time, it is expected the architect of the government will go ahead immediately with the plans of the Government building, and, so far as can be ascertained, it will probably be among the first buildings completed on the grounds.</p></div2>

Their bills were almost identical and a spirited contest has been waged during the past month to secure this concession. After discussing the matter from all sides the committee authorized Mr. Reed to enter late a contract with Hong Sling. The concession was let at what was regarded as a most favorable figure by the committees and the details of the contract were left to Manager Reed.</p>
                        <p>This was the first contract to be let for the Plaissance, and it was regarded as important to get the matter started right form the standing of the committee, as the terms will have an important bearing upon future contracts.

<p>The executive committee of the Women's Board of Managers for the exposition held a meeting yesterday with all members present.</p>
<p>The most important matter considered was the suggestion for a children's building. The plan suggested contemplates the erection of a building to be devoted to the work of the children, the building to be erected by the children of the transmississippi region. The general idea of such a building, erected in this manner, was approved by the committee and the details of carrying on the work of collecting the money required, as well as the size and arrangement of the building, will be more fully considered by the committee at some future meeting.</p>
<p>The committee decided to ask the Nebraska Exposition commission to devote $5,000 of the state appropriation for the purpose of assisting in making an educational exhibit.</p>
<p>The plan or organization for the women's department provides for an advisory council, to consist of two women from each state outside of Nebraska, the members of the council to be selected by the board. This council has not yet been formed, but the secretary was introduced to correspond with people who are prominent in educational circles in various states and endeavor to secure persons of prominence to act as members of the council.</p>
<p>It was decided to recommend to the executive committee of the exposition that the secretary of the Women's Board, Mrs. Frances M. Ford, be authorized to put in full time.

<head type="sub">Dixie Land Promises to Be Creditably Represented at Omaha.</head>
<ab>Birmingham (Ala.) News.</ab>
<p>The management of the Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha, Neb., next year is surprised and gratified, so it advises the News, at the action of the Alabama Industrial and Scientific society in taking steps to insure a creditable display of Alabama's mineral resources at the great western show. The society has already applied for space and proposes to place before the western people such a showing of our minerals as will impress them with the wonderful wealth of this region and the remarkable advantages it offers for development. The movement is a most important one, and its promoters should have the active aid of the state in furthering it. It is well in this connection to state that the Omaha Exposition is to be the largest of its kind ever held west of the Mississippi. Active preparations are going rapidly forward; the legislatures or western states are making liberal appropriations, the federal government having already set apart a sum; the railroads and liberal citizens are doing their parts and nearly $1,000,000 is now in sight for the project. The action of the Scientific society is timely. Alabama will have ample time to arrange a suitable exhibit as the exposition does not open until next June, and it is hoped that so excellent an opportunity will not be neglected.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="main">CHINESE AT THE EXPOSITION</head>
<head type="sub">WONG CHIN FOO SECURES A CONCESSION</head>
<head type="sub">He Will Make a Characteristic Display of the Arts and Industries of the <choice><sic>eClestial</sic><corr>Celestial</corr></choice> Empire Next Year.</head>
<p>Arrangements were completed this morning for a most valuable addition to the exhibits of the exposition. It will be a high grade Chinese exhibit and will occupy a separate building with a floor area of 5,000 square feet and fifty feet in heigh. The building and exhibit will cost $10,000 and will be an annex to the Manufacturers' building. The first installment of the payment for the space that his exhibit will occupy was turned over to the exposition authorities this morning by Wong Chin Foo, who will have charge of the exhibit.</p>
<p>This exhibit will be entirely distinct from the theater and other Chinese attractions,t he concession for which was let to Hong Sling, the Union Pacific's Chinese agent, the other day. The object of the exhibit is to display first-class Chinese handiwork and to prove that there are Chinese artisans of great skill and that all Chinamen are not coolies. Wong Chin Foo, the exhibitor, is the president of the Chinese Equal Rights league of America, which is seeking to convince Americans that Chinamen will make desirable citizens and should not be discriminated against. He is a superior Chinaman and has just been made a member of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben on account of his prominence. </p>
<p>A number of Chinese artisans will be engaged in the manufacture of articles of ivory and bamboo and other pieces of handiwork during the exposition. In addition tot his exhibit a handsomely uniformed guard of twenty-four Chinamen will do guard duty about the building. It is believed that the exhibit will prove one of the most attractive at the exposition. Wong Chin Foo bid for the concession for the Chinese Theater, but was unsuccessful. Thereupon H. B. Hardt and other officials of the Department of Exhibits asked him to make a Chinese exhibit, which he has just agreed to.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">EXHIBITS FOR THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">Many Applications for Space Are Being Received.</head>
<p>The task of securing exhibits for the Transmississippi Exposition is being vigorously prosecuted by the Department of Exhibits an the prospects continue to brighten. It is stated that more exhibits are already contracted for and in process of preparation than are to be found at the Tennessee exposition and the indications are that the Transmississippi Exposition will develop astonishing proportions. The demand for space is something unprecedented in the history of expositions. A delegate from the Department of Exhibits left for Colorado Saturday night and his first report is most encouraging. He ventures the prediction that Colorado will have one of the finest exhibits of any western state. M. C. Jackson will probably be appointed commissioner for Colorado and a permanent office will be opened in Denver in a few days.</p>
<p>The first direct foreign application for space arrived this morning from Prague. It came from Herman Lederer, a Botten and Posamentier ware manufacturer, who proposes to make an attractive exhibit.</p>
<p>William F. Gordon has been appointed representative for Howell and Ozark counties in Missouri. He is a large zinc and copper mine operator and orchard owner and is regarded as eminently fitted for the position. Lewis Bey has applied for the Ohio agency and Peter Schwenck for that of Indiana.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><dateline>THE EVENING BEE: SAT<lb/>URDAY, JUNE 12, 1897.</dateline>
    <head type="sub">MANY APPLICATIONS FOR SPACE.</head>
<head type="sub">Exposition People Feel Very Much Encouraged.</head>
<p>The Chicago Corset company is the latest applicant for space at the exposition. This concern wants 456 square feet, which will be furnished as a parlor. It will be populated by about twenty wax figures, on which the effects of the various styles of product will be displayed. The whole will be brilliantly illuminated by electric lights and decorated to make a novel and attractive exhibit.</p>
<p>Reports from the agents sent to other states continue to indicate flattering prospects. On Tuesday a big meeting was held at Deadwood, S. D., which was attended by leading business men from all the larger towns of the Black Hills. The greatest enthusiasm was manifested in the exposition and a big exhibit from South Dakota was guaranteed. The management has already received applications for about 6,000 feet of space from South Dakota.</p>
<p>The Denver papers are giving space every day to the exposition and the reports from Colorado indicate that the interest in an exhibit proportionate to the resources of the state is continually on the boom.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Senator Allen Introduces a Resolution to Enable Foreigners to Come to Omaha Next Year Without Restraint.</head>
<p>WASHINGTON, June 8.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Senator Allen introduced today a joint resolution authorizing the foreign exhibitors at the Transmississippi Exposition, to be held in Omaha next year, to bring to the United States foreign laborers from their various countries for the purpose of preparing for and making exhibits. The resolution recite the purposes of the exposition and seeks to set aside the act of congress of February 26, 1895, relative to the prohibition of importation of foreign labor, in order that countries deciding to exhibit at Omaha may have the benefit of native workmen. It further provides that goods designed for this exposition shall come in duty free, but within one year from their arrival they shall be removed, failing in which they customary duty shall be charged. This is in line with former acts of congress relative to expositions. The resolution will probably come up on final passage tomorrow, having gone to the calendar by agreement, after having been read twice. Senator Allen also has written the following letter to Secretary of War Alger: "I have the honor to inform you that it is my purpose to introduce a bill in the senate to authorize the secretary of war to mobilize at least 30 per cent of the military forces of the United States at Omaha, Neb., for thirty days, sometime during the Transmississippi and International Exposition in 1898, and I would be pleased to be informed by your department what extra expense this would incur to the government, taking into consideration, of course, that the troops would have to be subsisted, and the mobilization might be made in lieu of their annual marches. It would be gratifying to me also to be informed by you as to what further legislation, if any, would be necessary, in the opinion of the secretary of war, to authorize mobilization of one-third of the militia of the United States and probable cost thereof. I would also like to be informed on any other matters pertaining to the subject which may occur to you."</p>
<p>Acting Supervising Architect Kemper said today that no steps had yet been taken by his office toward plans for the government building at the Omaha Exposition. No design for the building has been made. It is probable that Chief Designer Totten will be sent to Omaha in a short time for the purpose of making his inspection. After his report has been received designs and plans and specifications will be made and work will be pushed as rapidly as possible in order that the building may be completed and occupied by the time the exposition opens. Mr. Kemper said it would probably be three months or more before the first contract on the South Omaha postoffice would be put upon the market. Specifications for the building are now in the computing division for final estimates.</p></div2>

McWhorter of the Transmississippi Troopers were present. The visitors urged the members of the Equestrian club to join the Troopers, and explained the best they could the apparent slight to the South Omaha club when invitations to meet and organize were sent out. According to these gentlemen one of the first invitations sent out was mailed to a member of the club, with the expectation that he would bring the matter to the attention of the members at the first opportunity. The officers of the Troopers do not feel that they are to blame because this was not done, and they regret very much that any hard feeling exists. No action was taken by the Equestrian club, but a committee promised to attend the meeting of the Troopers and talk the matter over.</p>
                        <p>The Equestrian club has a membership of about sixty, and if satisfactory arrangements are made it is thought that there will be no difficulty in obtaining thirty-two members who will be willing to join the Troopers.

Congressman Mercer was told by Speaker Reed to present the resolution, but the interposition of McMillin necessitated drawing political lines in support of the speaker and the house adjourned. Speaker Reed intimated that he would support Mercer on the joint resolution, which allows foreign labor to come into the United States during the term of the Transmississippi and International Exposition, but would oppose the concurrent resolution calling upon the president of the United States to make a proclamation as to the Transmississippi Exposition. upon this point Reed was most emphatic. He said that the State department was opposed to any recognition of local enterprises, unless held under national auspices. The precedent would be bad, and for this and other reasons he explained to Congressman Mercer he was opposed to any such recognition on the part of the president.

                        <p>Speaker Reed received this morning the following from Secretary Gage in relation to that clause of the joint resolution relative to Chinese labor:</p>
                        <p>To the House of Representatives: In connection with the proceedings now pending pertaining to the Transmississippi and International Exposition, to be held at Omaha, Neb., from June 1 to November 1, 1898, I deem it advisable to call your attention to the fact that under the privilege granted by congress to similar expositions held at San Francisco, Cal., Tacoma, Wash., Atlanta, Ga., Nashville, Tenn., and at the World's fair in Chicago, Ill., large number of Chinese were allowed to enter this country, ostensibly for the purpose of participating in such expositions, and that there is ground for the belief that the privileges accorded by the several laws on the subject in the admission of the Chinese to attend thee exposition to be held at Omaha, provision be made to restrict the number to be admitted as exhibitors, artisans, etc., and country immediately after the close of such exposition. Under laws heretofore passed, Chinese persons have been allowed one year after the close of the exposition with which they may leave the United States, and it inspectors, who have been engaged in tracing such persons as have failed to depart from this country as required by law, and large expenditures have been incurred thereby.

                        <p>Some little while ago the Commercial club of Omaha passed a series of resolutions calling upon the Interstate Commerce commission to explain why it had failed to render a decision in the Omaha bridge arbitrary case, which had been argued nearly three years ago before that body in this city. Congressman Mercer had an interview with Commissioner Knapp last week and in the course of the interview the commissioner, who was deputed to write the opinion, stated that for three years the commission consisted of only four members, late Commissioner Veazey being incapacitated to perform any of the duties of the office. Consequently the commissioners stood 2 to 2 regarding the case at bar. Now that a fifth commissioner has been appointed to succeed Mr. Veazey, the new commissioner, Mr. Prouty of New York, desired to review the case at length, and until such review could be had no decision would be handed down.</p>
                        <p>"Even though we arrive at a decision," said Mr. Knapp, "we are hung up by a recent decision of the supreme court in the Cincinnati case, which does not permit the commission to make rates. Consequently I have no means of knowing what the decision will be, but if it is in favor of Omaha it must necessarily be set aside under the rulings of the supreme court."</p>
                        <p>This probably explains the failure of the commission to hand down the decision. While it is not known definitely, it is believed that Messrs. Morrison and Knapp have stood for Omaha in its contention for the absorption of the bridge arbitrary, while Youmans and Clements have taken the other side for the proposition.</p>
                        <p>Telegrams were sent out yesterday from Washington to Governor Tanner urging him to approve the Illinois appropriation for the Omaha Exposition. Senator Thurston sent an additional telegram to P. D. Armour, urging him to use his influence with the governor. These were supplemented by telegrams from Mr. Rosewater to Governor Tanner and Mr. Armour and Omaha parties calling upon them to do all in their power to induce Governor Tanner to append his signature to the important measure.</p></div3>

                        <p>Congressman Mercer received a letter recently from Secretary M. J. Dowling of the National republican league, whose headquarters are at Detroit, stating that he was using every argument in his power to secure the next meeting of the league at Omaha. The league meets in Detroit this year and the help of Secretary Dowling is of the greatest possible importance, which, it is believed, if sustained by other members of that organization, will bring to Omaha in 1898 one of the leading political bodies of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The remainder of the invitations to foreign countries, which were omitted n the first presentation, were turned over to Assistant Secretary Cridler on Saturday. Now that the State department has received all the invitations to foreign countries to which this country has accredited representatives, they will at once be forwarded under seal of the State department.</p></div3></div2>

                        <head type="sub">Friends of the Transmississippi Exposition Convince the Governor of the Necessity of Affirmative Action by Him.</head>
                        <div3>
                        <p>A telegram was received by The Bee last evening to the effect that Governor Tanner of Illinois had signed the bill appropriating $45,000 for an exhibit from that state at the Transmississippi Exposition, there by removing that question from further consideration by the directors of the exposition.</p>
                        <p>The receipt of the news of the governor's action was the cause of great satisfaction among the friends of the exposition in this city. In fact, there has been nothing in connection with the exposition which has pleased the officers so much, unless it was the success of the government appropriation.</p>
                        <p>The bill providing for the appropriation by Illinois was prepared under the direction of the executive committee of the exposition when there were very few outside who gave the committee any encouragement to hope for anything from a state so far east. But the committee took the ground that the interest of Chicago in the success of Nebraska and other western states were so great that that state, possibly more than most of the states in that transmississippi country, would desire to be appropriately represented at the exposition. The bill was sent to Springfield and was introduced, referred to a committee, and then a delegation of business men from this city went to Chicago and from there to the capital of the state. At Chicago the party was the guest of men who had taken an active part in the building of the World's fair, and many of these were interested in the western enterprise to the extent that they also went to Springfield to aid by their presence and support the bill for the appropriation. At Springfield the two houses of the legislature had a joint session for the benefit of the delegation and listened to arguments by Nebraska men and by men from Chicago why Illinois should make the appropriation asked for.</p></div3>
                        <div3>
                        <head type="sub">INCREASES THE APPROPRIATION.</head>
                        <p>The result of this visit was that the house passed the bill providing for an appropriation of $35,000, the same amount that was set aside for the Nashville exposition. The measure, however, seemed to hang fire in the senate, and another delegation was sent over from Omaha. A member of this party was Lucius Wells of Council Bluffs, who has strong business connection in Illinois,and the fact of whose residence in Iowa had considerable weight, appearing as he did as a champion of the exposition. Another man who did good work for the bill was F. D. Higbee, who remained at Springfield for weeks, devoting his whole time to urging its passage, while it was before the legislature. While this committee was on the ground the senate took up the bill and passed it, amending by raising the amount of the appropriation to $50,000, and providing that $5,000 of the amount should be set aside for the salaries and expenses of the commission to be appointed to have charge of the disbursement of the fund.</p>
                        <p>The house was not willing to accept the provision for salaries for the commission, but was satisfied with the increased appropriation. The senate was disposed to hang out for its amendments, but on the advice of the delegation from the exposition management, and of other friends of the enterprise on the ground, the senate receded from the salary amendment and the bill was then sent to the governor, with a net appropriation of $45,000.</p>
                        <p>The Illinois friends of the bill felt satisfied that Governor Tanner would sign it. In fact he did sign it last week, but fearing afterward that the total appropriations for the year would exceed the limit he withdrew the bill. This action was communicated to the exposition authorities and the latter telegraphed to E. Rosewater, who is in Washington, and he prevailed upon the congressmen and senators from Illinois to telegraph the governor to allow the bill to stand. Governor Holcomb was also induced to send a telegram making a similar request. And yesterday afternoon the bill was re-signed.</p></div3>

                        <head type="sub">CHICAGO IS INTERESTED.</head>
                        <p>But this does not show all the work done by the executive committee and other friends of the exposition in favor of this Illinois appropriation. Many trips were made to Chicago by members of the committee, individually and collectively, and the powers in that city were made to understand the importance of securing the appropriation. The measure was closely watched from the time of its introduction till it was signed by the governor, and in the closing hours of its history the bill had no warmer friends in this city than some of those business men in Chicago who championed it.</p>
                        <p>The bill as it became a law provides for an appropriation of $45,000, with which Illinois shall erect a suitable building for an exhibit of the products and industries of the state. The money will be expended by a commission of twenty, being one from each congressional district, appointed by the governor, who shall serve without any compensation other than their actual expenses.</p></div3></div2>

                        <p>At a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles, held last Wednesday, the question of a southern California exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition was discussed and resolutions were passed, preliminary to enlisting the assistance of all the counties in the southern part of the state in the project. Hon. Lewis A. Groff had been asked to submit the matter of securing space for the exhibit to the board of directors of the exposition during his recent visit to his old home in Omaha, and his report was very satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>Judge Groff spoke in the most enthusiastic terms of the progress that was being made in preparing for the exposition. He said that the management and the people generally were enthusiastic over the enterprise and were pushing things with all possible rapidity. He declared that the success of the exposition was already assured, and detailed at some length the amount of work that had already been accomplished. George Parsons, vice president of the exposition for California, was also present, and urged that the chamber should take immediate action toward securing space. A letter from Manager E. E. Bruce of the Department of Exhibits was also read, and it was the unanimous sense of the members present that steps be taken at once to secure an exhibit that would fully represent the resources of their section of the state.</p></div2>

By a special motion the president and secretary of the meeting were also made members of this committee, after which the meeting was adjourned to meet again in the same place next Monday evening.</p>
<p>Great enthusiasm was shown at the meeting and the prospects of the project are very bright.</p></div2>

<p>Frank D. Higbee of Chicago, who has been a special representative of the exposition for some months, is in the city today. He comes with Mr. Sherman, owner of what is known as Sherman's Umbrella, for which a concession is desired. It promises to be a highly attractive feature of the amusement section.</p>
<p>Mr. Higbee for the past ten days has devoted his entire attention to the bill before the Illinois legislature, and was a potent factor in securing its final enactment in the closing hours of the late session. He watched the bill closely after it had reached the desk of Governor Tanner, and finding that the governor desired some public expression upon the merits of the bill before he would approve it, Mr. Higbee lost no time in bringing pressure to bear by leading citizens of Chicago. His efforts, coupled with those of the managers of the exposition, as heretofore chronicled in The Bee, proved effective, and the Illinois bill, appropriating $45,000, is now law.</p></div2>

    <head type="sub">NEW NOVELTY IN ENGINEERING.</head>
<head type="sub">Mammoth Umbrella to Be an Exposition Attraction.</head>
<p>The gigantic umbrella, which is expected to rival and even outdo the Ferris wheel of the World's fair, is now assured as one of the big features of the Transmississippi Exposition. This is dependent on the condition that the exposition mangers will be assured by engineers that it will be safe.</p>
<p>Manager Reed of the Department of Concessions was authorized to enter into a contract for the machine by the executive committee of the board of directors of the exposition at a special meeting which was held at the Commercial club yesterday afternoon. The contract will be safeguarded by certain necessary conditions, particularly that guaranteeing the safety of the thing.</p>
<p>R. E. Sherman of Chicago, the inventor of the machine, was present, explained the workings of his invention and offered his terms, which will be modified to a degree.</p>
<p>A description of the machine has already been published in The Bee. It will be a huge umbrella-shaped contrivance. Long arms, at the ends of which will be suspended baskets or cars for passengers. will raise and lower like the rods of an umbrella. Once raised the whole framework will revolve on the central axis. The arms will be raised by hydraulic pressure and the revolution will be brought about by electricity. The affair will be 350 feet in height and when open will have a diameter of 250 feet.</p>
<p>Mr. Sherman stated that the erection of the umbrella would cost $50,000. He guarantees to being work within ninety days and that $5,000 will be expended upon it by October 1. The exposition association will be protected by a safe bond that the umbrella will be as guaranteed.</p>
<p>This was one of the particular things that the executive committee met to consider. Another was to talk over the proposed Temple of Beauty, where the most beautiful women of every country in the world will be placed on exhibition. Fred Farwell of Chicago offered a proposition. He desired to erect a building 74x100 feet and presented the plans for it. The executive committee concluded that the structure was too plain in appearance and therefore refused to award the contract.</p>
<p>A proposition for the soda water privilege was offered by the same Philadelphia house which had the privilege at the Centennial exposition and at the World's air.</p>
<p>A considerable number of other matters were considered without final action.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">MANY APPLICANTS FOR SPACE.</head>
<head type="sub">Getting in on Ground Floor to Show at the Exposition.</head>
<p>The rush of applications for space at the exposition continues with constantly increasing volume. Every mail now brings in applications from firms and individuals from all over the United States who want to be represented at the big show and the business of the Department of Exhibits is assuming tremendous proportions. This morning's correspondence brought in a dozen applications to swell the list.</p>
<p>Among them were: Bernard &amp; Frank, glass furnishing specialties, New York; William R. Warner &amp; Co., pharmaceutical chemists, Philadelphia; Griswold Manufacturing company, fine castings and hardware, Erie, Pa.; Kearney Cotton Mills, Kearney, Neb.; Olive Wheel company, Syracuse, N. Y.; Barrett &amp; Barrett, liquors, Chicago; Dr. Hess &amp; Co., stock food, Ashland, O.; E. E. Sautter <unclear reason="folded"></unclear> company, St. Louis, Mo. The T. M. <unclear reason="folded">ain</unclear> company, Canton, O., has instructed its local agent to secure space and represent the company at the exposition. The department has also received a proposition from the Prentiss Clock Improvement company to supply as many calendar clocks as the exposition management may wish to place in the various exposition buildings. As the clocks are to be furnished free of cost, the offer will probably be accepted, unless some enterprising competitor offers to pay a bonus for the privilege.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">THE SOUTH AT THE EXPOSITION.</head>
<head type="sub">Georgia Takes Up the Work of Preparing an Exhibit.</head>
<ab>Columbus (Ga.) Enquirer-Sun.</ab>
<p>The exposition which will be held in Omaha next year promises to be the largest enterprise of the kind ever held west of the Mississippi, and second only tot he great World's fair at Chicago. The buildings which are to be erected on the grounds will cost $1,000,000, and no expense will be spared to make this one of the greatest shows of the century. Behind the enterprise is the great west, with all its boundless resources, and as an advertiser of western thrift and enterprise this fair will eclipse all others. Five hundred thousand dollars will be spent in putting the grounds of the exposition in shape. The fence around the grounds will be five miles in length, and it is proposed to make the landscapes one of the most attractive in the world.</p>
<p>The west expects the south to join with it in making this great western enterprise a complete success, and already the south gives evidence of doing its full share. In another place in this issue it will be seen that Alabama has already taken active steps to make a complete display of its products, and the same may be said of Louisiana. no better opportunity will ever be given the southern states to show to prospective emigrants what this section offers them in the way of homes and general resources. The south will no doubt be at Omaha in full force, and with an array of exhibits that will turn the eyes of all visitors to the exposition toward this section of the United States.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">ECLECTICS MEET IN OMAHA NEXT YEAR</head>
<head type="sub">Doctors Now in Session at Minnetonka Fix Upon the Exposition City as Their Next Meeting Place.</head>
<p>Another national convention has been secured for Omaha during the exposition year, and it is one of considerable importance. It is the meeting of the National Eclectic Medical society. The society is now holding its annual meeting at Lake Minnetonka, Minn., and it decided today that it would come to this city next year and take in the exposition, in addition to transacting professional business. The state society met in this city a few weeks ago and the move was first made then to secure the national convention for the exposition year and the delegates to Lake Minnetonka were so instructed.</p>
<p>The meeting will be held in June, and it is promised that there will be about 1,000 delegates in attendance from all parts of the country. It will probably mean more than that, for the exposition being then in progress there is apt to be a more complete representation of the eclectic school, and more of the physicians will bring their wives and families. The convention will remain in session four days.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">EASTERN PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED.</head>
<head type="sub">Many Exhibitors Apply for Space at the Exposition.</head>
<p>A gratifying feature of the work of the Department of Exhibits of the Transmississippi Exposition is the number of applications for space that come from the eastern states. This is conclusive evidence that the resources of the exposition are not confined to the transmississippi territory. Superintendent Hardt says that the manner in which applications have been pouring in warrants the prediction that by January, 1898, there will not be a foot of space that will be uncontracted for. The action of the management in making a charge for space will also have the effect of improving the exhibits. The tendency of the exhibitors will be to use less space and make better exhibits and there will be no trashy exhibits to detract from the merit of the whole. Under the established system visitors to the exposition will see something interesting every few feet and there will be little or nothing on exhibition that will not be worth seeing.</p>
<p>Another batch of applications for space came in this morning. Among them was that of the Hub Gore company of Boston, which wants 1,015 feet. M. H. Wiltzius &amp; Co. of Milwaukee wants 500 feet for a display of church goods and the Bolens Statuary company of Goshen, Ind., will occupy 124 feet with a display of statuary. Miss S. W. Talcott of Elmwood, Conn., and Mrs. W. Eisen of Chicago are among the first applicants for space in the Art building. They have each two pictures which they wish to place on exhibition.</p>

There are from 10,000 to 15,000 yards of earth to be moved.</p>
<p>Resolutions were adopted expressing the thanks of the exposition managers to Ferdinand W. Peck, H. N. Higinbotham, J. B. VanCleave, William Penn Nixon, Moses P. Handy, P. A.

<head type="sub">Kentucky Party Applies for Space at the Exposition.</head>
<p>The exposition management received an application this morning for space for what promises to be a most unique and attractive exhibit. The proprietor of Lily Park, Smith's Grove, Ky., writes for space for a big exhibit of water lilies. His idea is to construct an artistically arranged lagoon, which will be literally covered with water lilies of every known variety. He is said to have the largest stock and the greatest variety of these flowers of any horticulturist on this hemisphere. He now has a very fine exhibit at the Nashville exposition. The management is convinced that the proposed exhibit would be a very popular attraction. The only difficulty is the fact that it would require a considerable time to properly install the exhibit, and it is somewhat doubtful whether the lake could be prepared in time.</p>

Lowe to all the diplomatic and consular officials of the United States as the representative of the Transmississippi and International Exposition for the purpose of arranging for exhibits with foreign governments, corporations and individuals.

    <div3>
<p>Another convention was today added to the number that Omaha will entertain during the exposition year. The additional body which will meet here in 1898 is the national association of the railway postal clerks, which is now in session in Philadelphia. A telegram was this afternoon received from W. C. Vandervoort, the delegate from this division, to the effect that next year's session had been safely captured.</p>
<p>The convention is a very desirable body to obtain. It will bring to this city about 500 delegates from all over the country. The great majority of them are ordinarily accompanied by their families. The session usually lasts the biggest part of a week.</p>
<p>The convention was secured largely through the efforts of the representatives from this division. The postal clerks who make their homes in this city have been laying their wires for some time to capture the meeting, and the delegates were instructed to do all in their power to get it.</p></div3>
<div3>    
<head type="sub">FISH MEN COME, TOO.</head>
<p>Another national association that will meet in this city in annual convention next year is the American Fisheries' society. The Bee this afternoon received a telegram from W. L. May, delegate from this state, to the effect that the society, which is now in session at Detroit, has selected Omaha as the place for holding the next year's meeting. The body will meet in this city on the third Wednesday in July an will remain in session for several days.</p>
<p>This convention is likely to bring a feature of considerable interest with it. This will consist of fish exhibits of an extensive character. It is expected that the meeting will call to this city somewhere between 500 and 750 visitors.</p>

The exhibit consists of the old houses in which Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis were born, together with a valuable collection of historical relics of the two homesteads. The proprietors declare their ability to accompany the exhibit with the most absolute evidence of its genuineness and the exposition management is disposed to regard the proposition with favor.</p>

    <head type="main">IN THE "CZAR'S" DOMAIN.</head>
<head type="sub">A Few Items of Interest for the Hypnotized Directors to Study Over.</head>
<head type="sub">Geraldine Is a "Gang Pusher" and His Hypnotic System Is Still at Work.</head>
<p>The following letter was written to an old citizen of Omaha, in answer to a letter of inquiry for information as to Dion Geraldine's position at the World's Fair. It is written by one of the ablest editors of Chicago, and a man who knows what he writes about and is not "afraid" to speak the truth. After "Geraldine left because he forgot at times that he had a superior officer," we have it from good authority that he occupied the position of "signer of passes" admitting workmen into the park. Are these "responsible" positions sufficient to entitle him to declare himself, "The Czar of Jackson Park?"</p>
<p>Here is the letter:</p>
<p>CHICAGO,Ill., March 4, '97.&#8212;Dear Sir&#8212;I mislaid you letter with matters for this month's paper and have just come across it. Please pardon delay.</p>
<p>The title as published in the clipping is right, but is misleading. He was general superintendent, or in other words foreman of the foremen, under the chief of construction, D. H. Burnham. Mr. Geraldine was not appointed till after Mr. Root's death. Mr. Root's work was advisory only, for he died the day the architects first met together.</p>
<p>Ten architects, and also Olmsted for landscape, were selected and they met and decided on a plan of action which was approved.</p>
<p>Then Mr. D. H. Burnham was appointed chief of construction. He appointed Geraldine general superintendent; Shonkland, chief engineer; W. S. McHard, chief sanitary engineer, etc., etc. Mr. Burnham was defacto the head authority of everything outside of the executive body.</p>
<p>I might say that there was a strong indication that Geraldine left because he forgot at times that he had superior officer. he is a capable foreman; one of the best to manage a large body of men I know of, but he has, in my opinion, no executive ability beyond that. Nor do I think that he is specially expert in building construction. My impression of him being that he can rush a gang of men on a railroad grade, or a building, and is simply a foreman. Sincerely,</p>
<ab>ROBERT CRAIK MCLEAN,</ab>
<ab>Managing Editor Inland Architect.</ab>
<p>And this is the "czar of Jackson park!"&#8212;the man that has all the directors, except Rosewater and Bruce, hypnotized!</p>
<p>Think of the frigid Gilbert M. Hitchcock being putty in the hands of a section foreman! This is "tew" much!</p>
<p>Think of Stock Yards Babcock being bossed by a "gang rusher,"</p>
<p>Think how shocked pretty Abe Reed will be when he finds out that the man that hypnotized him smells like a mechanic! Oh! mamma!</p>
<p>Think how pale Never-Overlook-a-Bet Lindsey will turn when he hears the news.</p>
<p>And poor, little, fretful Mr. Kirkendall has not the strength to break the section foreman's spell!</p>
<p>An imported "expert" watchman who "knows Mr. Geraldine" is guarding the exposition grounds from intruders at&#8212;we don't know how much per day&#8212;but he is chump enough to think that the Omaha people are a lot of "suckers." Several weeks go one of the old fair grounds buildings was being moved across the "lagoon" towards the fence across the 20th street entrance. As it approached that "dead line" the eye of the "expert" watchman sighted a graft. He stood guard at the fence and placidly told the movers that he would have "his men remove the fence and put it back on payment of $15, so they waited till "his men" were out of the way, when they tore down the fence and moved onto the free soil of Twentieth street, and left the "expert" watchman short his expected $15 graft. This is another instance wherein the Omaha "expert" was more "expert" than the imported article.</p>
<p>Bids ranging from eight to five cents <unclear reason="torn"/>

sent to "Boston or Chicago" for an "expert" pile driver. When he came he demonstrated that he knew little about driving piles. An Omaha man came to the rescue and took charge of the machine, but the "Boston or Chicago" man was kept on the pay roll as an "expert" time-keeper.</p>
<p>While the "expert" was managing the driver it cost several times as much to drive the piles as the bids offered, and not until the Omaha man was placed in charge did the work progress satisfactorily, or the cost diminish.</p>
<p>This is a practical illustration that we have men in our city who are entitled to these positions, both on account of their citizenship and their superior ability.</p>
<p>Do we need expert time-keepers?</p>
<p>Do we need expert pile-drivers?</p>
<p>In fact are there any positions on the exposition grounds for which we cannot furnish experts from our own people?</p>
<p>These questions can be answered by the executive committee, not by calling them "street rumors," but by placing men in charge of affairs who will manage the construction of the exposition for the best interests of Omaha and her citizens.</p>
<p>If the exposition directory wants to employ any Omaha staff workers we can furnish them the home address of statuary and staff workers competent to work out any design from a mouse to an elephant or mounted dragoon. We can also furnish the address of a number of architects' modellers, stone carvers, etc., some of them graduates of the best schools of design and colleges in the east. These men are all Omaha men and it will not do to bluff us by telling us we cannot get men in Omaha competent for this work on the exposition.</p>
<p>A CHALLENGE&#8212;Give Mr. Lowrey Wallace of Omaha a piece of work in modelling or designing to perform and set one of the best men you can bring from the east on like work, and if Wallace does not beat him the other man can have the price of both jobs. Now, Mr. Kirkendall, here is a chance to hire an Omaha expert.</p>
<p>Geraldine's "expert" engineers from the east botched the job of pile driving by ordering them cut two feet too shirt, and <choice><sic>them</sic><corr>then</corr></choice> had to splice them. We are going to do a little "expert" overseeing ourselves.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosewater will be in the game now, and Geraldine will have to attend strictly to business or he will be called down. He cannot use the little editor to get next to the money end of the exposition.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">Foreign Governments Apprised of the Nature and Extent of the Transmississippi Exposition and Asked to Participate.</head>
    <div3>
<p>WASHINGTON, June 19.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Forty-two letters, bearing the well known signature of John Sherman, as secretary of state, addressed to American ministers in foreign countries, went out from the State department today. Following is a copy of the letter:</p>
<p>I transmit herewith a letter dated May 1, 1897, addressed by the president of the Transmississippi and International Exposition, extending a cordial invitation to this excellency, the president of the Argentine Republic, and the citizens thereof, to take part in an exposition to be held at Omaha, Neb., from Jun 1 to November 1, 1898, agreeable to an act of congress, approved June 10, 1896, "for the exhibition of the resources of the United States of American and the progress and civilization of the western hemisphere, and for a display of the arts, industries, manufactures and products of the soil and sea." I <choice><sic>inclose</sic><corr>enclose</corr></choice> several copies of a circular issued by the secretary of the treasury on January 11, 1897, which not only embodies the law of congress upon the subject, but prescribes the regulations under which all articles imported from foreign countries for the sole purpose of exhibition at the proposed exposition, and on which duties are to be collected under the laws of the United States, shall be admitted free of payment of duty customs, fees or charges, except, of course, whenever any such dutiable articles may be sold or withdrawn for consumption in the United States.</p>
<p>According to Section 3 of the act aforesaid there shall be exhibited at the Omaha Exposition by the government of the United States from its executive departments, Smithsonian  Institution, United States Fish commission and National museum, such articles and material as illustrate the function and administrative faculty of government in time of peaces and its resources as a war power, tending to demonstrate the nature of our institutions and their adaptations to the wants of the people.</p>
<p>It is the earnest wish of the executive head of the Transmississippi and International Exposition that the government to which you are accredited (and its colonial dependencies) may find it practicable to the importance and character of enterprise. you may take an early occasion to deliver the enclosed invitation to the minister for foreign affairs, to the end that it may reach its high destination. In doing this and making known to him the statements herein contained, you may express the satisfaction it would give your government to know that the government of his excellency had consented to accept the courteous invitation.</p>
<p>You should, however, be careful to explain that although the government of the United States purposes to be represented in accordance with the cited provisions of the law, the proposed exposition is in no wise under the auspices of patronage of the federal government, neither is the latter held in any manner liable or responsible on account of the Transmississippi and International Exposition association. Respectfully yours, JOHN SHERMAN.</p>
<p>This letter was prepared by Third Assistant Secretary F. W. Cridler, who had also the same function to perform in the case of the Atlanta, Nashville, New Orleans and Chicago expositions. This, Mr. Cridler says, is the most exhaustive letter sent from the State department in behalf of an exposition except in the case of the World's fair, when the president issued his proclamation, which was also prepared by Mr. Cridler, the head of the diplomatic bureau.</p></div3>

<head type="sub">DESIGNING THE BUILDING.</head>
<p>Chief Designer Totten of the supervising architect's office is now engaged in preparing a sketch of the proposed public building at the Omaha Exposition. He has copies of the sketch plans of the exposition company and is following a design which will harmonize with the appearance of the other buildings of the exposition. It is probable that Mr. Totten will not be ordered to Omaha to look over the site of the location, as he has a plan of the grounds in his office, and all the necessary data of frontage that he can gain by a visit to the exposition grounds. Acting Supervising Architect Kemper was asked today to give his opinion on the placing of a facsimile of Mount Vernon in the exposition. He said that it would make a good state building in his opinion, but was not suited for a large exhibition on account of lack of space.</p></div3></div2>

<p>Finance and labor propositions consumed most of the time of the board of directors of the Trans-Mississippi exposition at the meeting yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Manager Kirkendall of the department of buildings and grounds again called attention to the importance of having a considerable sum of money in the treasury as the time approached for letting the contracts for the construction of the buildings. On the recommendation of the executive committee, it was decided that on the payment on or before July 10 of the 35 per cent of subscriptions not assessable until 1898, a discount of 5 per cent be allowed, but no subscriber can take advantage of this proposition until all but 35 per cent of the amount he has subscribed has been paid.</p>
<p>It was believed that this would be the best plan to encourage the payment of subscriptions and hurry in an mount sufficient to make the total receipts on stock $200,000, and thus make available the state appropriation of $100,000 July 9.</p>
<p>In addition to this, an additional assessment of 20 per cent was levied, to be paid by August 1.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">YOUNG'S RESOLUTION.</head>
<p>Mr. Young, on behalf of the Building Trades council presented the resolution that was turned down by the executive committee at a recent meeting, and which was to the effect that in the contracts for the construction of buildings on the grounds it should be stipulated that only union and skilled labor be employed.</p>
<p>As soon as this had been offered Mr. Lyman offered another. It was in substance that the executive committee be directed that in the employment of labor, preference should be given to stockholders in the exposition association, or to those who were willing to become such, and that 10 per cent be withheld from the wages of the laborers so employed, and applied to the payment of their subscription until an amount had been withheld equal to the assessments already made, and that after that the assessments be paid in the usual way or by withholding, the same rules as to efficiency to apply to stockholders as to others.</p>
<p>Young moved that the resolution be laid over until the next meeting, but the motion was lost, and then on a motion to adopt, Messrs. Kilpatrick and Hussie spoke adversely. They could <choice><sic>seen</sic><corr>see</corr></choice> no good to be accomplished by the resolution, and were afraid there was harm in it.</p>
<p>Lyman urged in favor of the resolution that it would encourage laboring men to subscribe.</p>
<p>Alvin Saunders looked with no favor on the consideration of any labor resolutions whatever by the board of directors. He believed that the only sensible thing to do was to leave the whole labor question with the executive committee. Following this suggestion, and on motion of Carpenter, the resolution was referred to that committee.</p></div3>
    <div3>
<head type="sub">PLEA FOR UNION LABOR.</head>
<p>Youngs then brought up his resolution again and moved its adoption. He said it would guarantee a high class of work on the exposition buildings, and would protect home contractors, who had all agreed to employ none but union labor, from disastrous competition with outside contractors, who would be able to underbid them if they were allowed to employ cheap labor.</p>
<p>Saunders moved to amend by providing that this resolution be also referred to the executive committee, and Mr. Wells piled an amendment on an amendment by moving the consideration of the resolution be indefinitely postponed. He said it was in effect the same resolution as that sprung soon after the inception of the exposition enterprise, and which provided that only home labor be employed by the exposition association.</p>
<p>The very suggestion of that resolution, he said, had done a vast deal of harm to the project, for it had created the impression that the exposition was to be nothing but a Douglas county fair. His own state of Iowa was the first to make an appropriation for the exposition, and it was the original intention that the small amount of $10,000 should be increased by the next legislature, but some of the members of that legislature were under the impression that the resolution had been adopted, and were therefore opposed to increasing the appropriation. He wanted the wide open policy to be continued.</p>
<p>Youngs insisted that the adoption of the course suggested by him would not give the home contractors any advantage over those in Iowa or anywhere else, but would simply put all contractors on the same basis.</p>
<p>Wells' amendment was carried, the only negative vote being Youngs'.</p></div3>

<head type="sub">MR. HITCHCOCK RESIGNS.</head>
<p>Manager Hitchcock of the department of promotion submitted his resignation as manager and as a member of the executive committee. He stated that his business required the time that he was now giving to exposition work. He recommended that in his stead President Wattles be placed at the head of the promotion department and be made a full member of the executive committee.</p>
<p>Following is the text of the letter of resignation presented by Mr. Hitchcock:</p>
<p>To the Board of Directors, Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition&#8212;Gentlemen: I herewith resign by position as manager of the department of promotion and member of the executive committee.</p>
<p>I also take the liberty of recommending that President Wattles be elected to succeed me for the reason that he is familiar with the work of the department and in constant attendance at the executive committee meetings.</p>
<p>In resigning at this time I carry out my intention expressed at the time I unwillingly accepted the position. It seemed to be desirable that I should take the position, at least during the first few troublous months, and I did so.</p>
<p>The department is now well organized and the work well in hand. Legislative work is over and what remains to be done will be to build upon foundations already laid. were it not for the pressure of private business I should be glad to continue my agreeable relations as a member of the executive committee, and I regret the necessity which compels me to retire from the management. G. M. HITCHCOCK.</p>
    <p>Messrs. Weller, Wells, Lindsey, Kirkendall and other spoke against accepting the resignation. They commended

    the efficiency of the department of promotion as organized and operated by Mr. Hitchcock, and his counsel in the meeting of the executive committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hitchcock pleaded earnestly to have the resignation accepted, but Mr. Weller's motion to the contrary was carried by a unanimous vote.</p>
        <p>A letter was read from the secretary of the Gold Mining association, asking that the directory and a delegation to the convention, which is to be held at Denver, July 7, to address the convention on the subject of the exposition. It was decided to send a delegation.</p></div3>
    <div3>
        <head type="sub">FEDERAL BUILDING.</head>
        <p>A communication from Acting Government Supervising Architect Kaempfer to the supervising architects of the exposition was read. The letter referred to a preliminary study of the Trans-Mississippi exposition building sent by him. He stated that the exhibit space in the government building at Nashville was 31,000 square feet, and that it was desirable that the space in the building at Omaha should exceed this by 12 per cent. He gave it as his opinion that the main height of the building should be forty or fifty feet and the whole surmounted by a dome. He asked for further data, so that there might be as little delay as possible in getting the construction under way.</p>
        <p>The following resolutions, introduced by Mr. Hitchcock, were passed:</p>
        <p>Whereas, The uncertainty as tot he validity of the present city charter is working great damage to the business interests of the city and to the prospects of the exposition, and until the city and the exposition are advised as to which charter is the law, it will not be possible to proceed with important municipal and exposition affairs; therefore, be it</p>
        <p>Resolved, By the board of directors that the management of the exposition petition the supreme court of Nebraska to treat the charter litigation as urgent and expedite it to a decision at the earliest possible moment so that the uncertainty may be ended.</p>
        <p>Resolved, That the president forward a copy of these resolutions to each of the judges of the supreme court.</p>
        <p>W. R. Bennett and a committee of the Omaha Fair and Seed association addressed the directors on the subject of the bonding of the association's debt and asking for advice as to how to complete the process.</p></div3>
    <div3>
        <head type="sub">LITERARY CONTESTS.</head>
        <p>The competitions which the Woman's department of the exposition has instituted for individual students are indicated under the following subjects Nature study, drawing, penmanship, manual training, history and composition.</p>
        <p>The formula of the first has been arranged by Prof. Bessy of the Nebraska state university, and is intended to stimulate the children and young people in the investigation of animal and plant life. The formula invites the smallest children to consider the trees, flowers and grasses of their respective counties, illustrated by mounted collections of leaves, blossoms, blades or stems, with name and habit indicated. The competition provides for the higher grades, collections of insects and for anatomical drawings of the same, and specimens of woods. Also for original work in botany and entomology, with specimens prepared for microscopic study, from university and college students.</p>
        <p>In drawing the program shows nature work, leaves, branches, fruits, etc., done in black and white, with pen and ink, pencil, brush or crayon, or in color, figure sketching from life, designing of fabrics, wall paper and tile, book covers, and stock certificates for children's building illustrating of stories and poems, or extracts from either, and mechanical or constructive drawing, which is open to college and university students.</p>
        <p>Penmanship is noted in all grades of the schools and there is a competition for business colleges.</p>
        <p>Manual training calls for a finished piece of work in each of five grades, and there is a competition for girls on sewing and mending.</p></div3>
    <div3>
        <head type="sub">HISTORICAL DEPARTMENT.</head>
        <p>History shows some interesting topics for written work, as follows: Supposed speech of George Washington at the opening of the Trans-Mississippi exposition; compromises involved in the constitution of the United States; conversation between Gladstone and Bismarck; the power of Russia in European politics; the diary of a <unclear reason="torn">C</unclear> patriot; conversation between an Armenian and Cretan of the nineteenth century; a comparison of the French chamber of deputies with the house of representatives of the United States; a puzzle in Trans-Mississippi history, which it is announced will be ready September 1, is also noted.</p>
        <p>Composition gives opportunity for children's stories, for language work, essays, letters, book reviews and character sketches. Colleges and universities are invited to compete in three literary lines, viz.: by romance, novelette or poem.</p></div3></div2>

        <head type="main">MANY AMUSEMENT FEATURES</head>
        <head type="sub">NOVELTY EXHIBITS FOR THE EXPOSITION</head>
        <head type="sub">Electricity Section to Be of Unusual Interest&#8212;More Entries Now Than at Atlanta Just Previous to Opening.</head>
        <div3>
        <p>Everything now indicates that the amusement features at the Transmississippi Exposition will be of a high order, and that they will be fully as numerous as at the World's fair. Already many concessions have been grated and hardly a day passes that applications are not filed with Manager Reed of the Department of Concessions and Privileges.</p>
        <p>Last week a concession was granted to R. E. Sherman, a draughtsman in the office of the recorder of deeds of Cook county, Illinois, for permission to erect and maintain during the exposition a gigantic umbrella, which is to eclipse the Ferris wheel. Mr. Sherman, who files the application, is a resident of Chicago and is the inventor of the umbrella.</p>
        <p>The mammoth umbrella will stand on a bluff at the head of the Plaisance or Midway, facing the Missouri river. This bluff rises 225 feet above the river, and when the arms of the umbrella are extended the passengers in the cars will be 575 feet above the Missouri. Inside of the <choice><sic>inclosure</sic><corr>enclosure</corr></choice> on top of the bluff will be a palm garden, the ground space occupied being 300 feet square.</p>
        <p>The vertical standard of the umbrella will be 350 feet high, made of steel and iron, and anchored in a stone foundation thirty feet deep and seventy-five foot square. It will be forty feet in diameter of 126 feet in circumference. On the sides of the standard, running from the bottom up, will be forty rails, forming ten tracks for the lower platform to move up and down. On this platform will be a circular track on which another platform is to revolve, the latter platform holding the standard which supports the arms of the umbrella.</p></div3>
        <div3>
        <head type="sub">SIXTEEN CARS WILL RISE.</head>
        <p>The arms are to be 110 feet in length, at the extremities of which the cars are to be suspended. From the outer end of the arms cables will reach to the top of the standard, connected there with counter weights, which travel up and down on the inside of the standard. The cars will be constructed on the same principle as those of the Ferris wheel, built of iron and steel, and will hold forty passengers each. There will be sixteen of these cars. The lower platform will also be used for passengers, having a carrying capacity of about 200. This <choice><sic>plaform</sic><corr>platform</corr></choice> will rise to the height of 240 feet.</p>
        <p>The whole machine will be operated by electricity. Each car will be lighted with different colored electric lights, and on the top of the standard will be a searchlight, which the exposition company will provide. The umbrella will make three trips an hour.</p>
        <p>H. R. Hinchliff of Chicago, who was connected with the construction of the World's fair buildings, is the engineer who will supervise the erection of the Sherman umbrella.</p>
        <p>On Chicago day a free ride in the umbrella will be given to every Chicago person attending the exposition.</p>
        <p>Electricity, applied in different ways, scientific, industrial and decorative, will form the most attractive features of the exposition. Already active rivalry exists between prospective exhibitors in the electrical section, for Manager E. E. Bruce of the Department of Exhibits, has announced special prizes&#8212;gold, trophy, silver cup and gold medal&#8212;for the best electric light service and display. The manner in which applications for space are coming in is a source of satisfaction to the manager of the department and his active lieutenants. More space has been allotted to exhibitors than was taken at the Atlanta exposition up to three months prior to the opening of the gates. Every mail brings a batch of applications from the east, and it is wholly within bounds to predict that the Manufactures building, and particularly the electrical section, will be fully representative.</p></div3>
        <div3>
        <head type="sub">WILL ATTRACT ELECTRICIANS.</head>
        <p>Prof. R. B. Owens of the University of Nebraska has been appointed commissioner of the electrical section of the exposition. Prof. Owens' appointment as commissioner for the electrical section is regarded with much favor. He is said to be well qualified for the duties of this responsible position, and he will have full charge of the work of organizing and superintending the electrical department. Beside the convention of the National Electric Light association, the professor will endeavor to secure other meetings of technical societies for 1898, as of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the American Street Railway association. It is the intention to make the exposition an irresistible magnet of attraction for every person interested in the scientific and practical study of things electrical.</p>
        <p>Colonel W. F. Sapp, one of the prominent business men of Council Bluffs, was over to Chicago the other day and was caught for an interview by a reporter for one of the papers of that city. In the course of the conversation the subject of the Transmississippi Exposition was brought up, when Colonel Sapp said:</p>
        <p>"You see we on the Iowa side of the river are just as deeply interested in the success of the exposition as our Nebraska neighbors. In fact all western Iowa expects to reap some of the benefits from the onward march of visitors to the Transmississippi. We have met with encouragement in nearly all of the states west of the Mississippi, and Illinois has got into line and will have a good representation at the exposition.</p>
        <p>"Iowa was the first state to make an appropriation, and as this action as taken at the request of Council Bluffs business men, we are with Omaha in the <choice><sic>interprise</sic><corr>enterprise</corr></choice> first, last and all the time. There are many discouraging features to be overcome, but Omaha and Council Bluffs expect to come out on top and have a great show there in 1898.</p>
        <p>"Plans are almost perfected for the connecting of the two cities by more rapid transit, and Council Bluffs will get her full share of visitors who will be within a half hour's ride from the exposition grounds."</p></div3></div2>
    
    <div2 type="article"><head type="main">CONVENTIONS FOR OMAHA</head>
        <head type="sub">MANY ARE SECURED FOR EXPOSITION YEAR</head>
        <head type="sub">Now Organizing to Go After Some of the Larger National Gatherings with Good Prospects for Winning.</head>
        <div3>
        <p>When the Transmississippi Exposition directors, the Commercial club, and the societies of the city started in several weeks ago to secure conventions for exposition year, they felt that they would do well if they <choice><sic>succeded</sic><corr>succeeded</corr></choice> in landing half a dozen. Already they have passed the limit they set and at this time they feel that the work has hardly been commenced.</p>
        <p>The annual convention of the Travelers' Protective association was the first secured and this success naturally caused a general good feeling, as it is known that the meeting will be in session fully one week, and will bring not less than 1,000 delegates to the city, besides an equal number of friends.</p>
        <p>The Swedish Evangelical conference decided by a unanimous vote to meet in Omaha next year. This conference is usually attended by from 500 to 750 ministers and laymen. The conference continues for one week.</p>
        <p>One of the important meetings of the year will be the general assembly of the United Presbyterian church. It is estimated that the attendance will be between 1,500 and 2,000, and that the meetings will continue over one week. Aside from the church people there will be a large number of agents representing book concerns.</p>
        <p>The annual convention of the American Nurserymen's association will be held <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> during the summer and will bring <unclear reason="torn"></unclear> shrubbery men from all over the country. The meetings will be attended by not less 800 delegates, and will continue six days, and possibly two weeks. So far, as the farmers are concerned, this is considered the most important convention of the year.</p>
        <p>The National Eclectic Medical society, which has just concluded its annual meeting at Lake Minnetonka, Minn., voted to come to Omaha next year. The last meeting was attended by some 200 delegates and a large number of medicine and instrument men.</p>
        <p>The Danish Lutheran church of America, which held its annual meeting at Marinette, Wis., last week, voted to hold next year's meeting in Omaha. The meeting that just adjourned was attended by 100 delegates and continued in session one week. It is said the attendance will be larger next year.</p></div3>
        <div3>
        <head type="sub">POSTAL CLERKS COMING.</head>
        <p>The annual convention of the Association of Railway Postal Clerks was held in Philadelphia this year, but next year it comes to Omaha. The last convention was attended by 750 delegates and lasted four days. This is considered one of the desirable conventions, as it usually brings a large contingent of postal men in other lines aside from the railway mail service.</p>
        <p>Through the efforts of W. L. May of the Nebraska Fish commission, and other Omaha citizens, the next <choice><sic>annaul</sic><corr>annual</corr></choice> meeting of the American Fisheries society has been captured. The convention will meet on the third Wednesdays in July and will be in session four days. There will be something like 500 delegates, and about as many more visitors and supply men from all parts of the country.</p>
        <p>In addition to the conventions already secured, citizens and members of societies are bending every effort to bring more, some of which will be attended by thousands of delegates and visitors.</p>


<pb n="187" xml:id="TMISB02-187"/>    



<p>Among the conventions in sight and those which it is hoped may be brought to the city is the National Educational association, which meets in Milwaukee this year. this meeting will be attended by from 15,000 to 20,000 teachers and educational workers.</p>
<p>A strong effort is being made to get the 1898 meeting of the Epworth league, which meets in Toronto, Canada, this year. The churches and ministers of the city are handling the campaign which is being made to locate this meeting, and at this time they feel very much encouraged. They estimate the attendance at 30,000.</p>
<p>The American Institute of Homeopathy is likely to convene in Omaha during exposition year, and will be in session for more on week to ten days. Usually the meetings are attended by from 300 to 400 doctors, and half as many more appliance and instrument agents.</p>
<p>This year the League of American Wheelmen will meet in Philadelphia and an effort will be made to have the 1898 meeting held in Omaha. Omaha will send down a strong delegation and the members will have the support of the city, several of the western states, and all of the railroads centering at Omaha. The meeting will be attended by about 15,000 wheelmen this year and all of the bicycle companies will have agents and representatives in attendance. </p>
<p>Omaha will send a delegation of 200 to Minneapolis to capture the next annual meeting of the Elks. The delegation will go on a special train, taking a band and plenty of matter advertising the exposition. This meeting is the session of the supreme lodge and is attended by about 1,000 Elks.</p>
<p>Everything is working in good shape for the securing of the next annual meeting of the National League of Republican clubs and a strong delegation will be on hand to press the claims of Omaha. The meeting is attended by more than 1,000 members.</p>
<p>The meeting of the Association of Local Freight Agents of America is another convention that is on the string. The railroads centering here are working hard and they give out the assurances that Omaha will win. The convention is usually attended by about 750 freight men and nearly as many more railroaders who work in other lines.</p></div3></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">MEETING OF MINISTERIAL UNION.</head>
<head type="sub">Members Discuss Openings Exposition Gates on Sundays.</head>
<p>The Ministerial union met in regular monthly session at the Kountze Memorial church this morning for the last time until October 18. The attendance, while good, was not up to the usual standard, although the business on hand was of much interest and importance.</p>
<p>The matter of holding a union revival here throughout the hot months of July and August occasioned a lengthy and vigorous discussion, the consensus of judgment being that a series of such meetings was very necessary and would result in incalculable good. The plan is to erect a huge temporary tabernacle in the open air, and engage some well known evangelist to conduct the meetings. Both Dr. Williams and Major Cole were recommended, but the matter was finally disposed of by being referred to a committee consisting of Revs. Wilson, Everts and MacAyeal.</p>
<p>Rev. F. H. Sanderson of the Trinity Methodist Episcopal church stated to the meeting that the ministers of the north side had held several conferences recently with reference to the opening of the gates of the approaching <choice><sic>Trassmississippi</sic><corr>Transmississippi</corr></choice> Exposition on the Sabbath day. He said they were a unite on the absolute necessity of keeping the gates closed on the Lord's day and had been requested to solicit the sentiment, as well as aid of the Ministerial Union in the accomplishment <unclear reason="torn"></unclear>red end.</p>
<p>This statement launched a very ardent discussion on the subject. Finally Rev. E. MacDill made a motion that a committee consisting of one representative from each denomination in the city be appointed by the chair to confer with the directory of the exposition on the subject and report at the meeting of the union in October. This was carried unanimously, whereupon Chairman Llwyd appointed the committee as follows: Revs. Turkle, McCormick, Mackey, Vawter, Warfield, Gilchrist, Sanderson, Everts and Savidge.</p>
    <p>The subjects on the regular card for discussion were then taken up, with W. W. Everts, D. D., on "Luxury." His paper was one of the most finished <choice><sic>desertations</sic><corr>dissertations</corr></choice> the members have been treated to in many days an was received with every demonstration of approval and appreciation.</p>
<p>Rev. W. W. Harsha, D. D., closed the session with a well conceived paper on Exegesis. </p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">Launching a Magazine.</head>
<p>A. J. Dockarty, who designed the letterhead of the exposition, is at work on the first number of the Transmississippi magazine, which will be issued about July 15. At present the publication will boom the exposition from an artistic point of view, but the intention is to make it a permanent fixture among the illustrated magazines of the country. The illustrations for the cover of the first number are already completed. The front will show a reproduction of the Arch of States, and on the back will appear an artistic representation of the west end of the lagoon and the surrounding buildings.</p></div2>

<head type="sub">PLAN TO MAKE AN EXHIBIT AT EXPOSITION</head>
<head type="sub">Preliminary Steps Taken to Secure the Erection of a Building and Secure Features from Exposition at Stockholm.</head>
<p>The Danish citizens of Omaha are preparing to get to the front in exposition matters and the preliminary steps have been taken toward forming an exhibit that will be one of the distinguishing features of the exposition.</p>
<p>A large number of prominent Danes met at Washington hall Saturday night and organized an association for the exclusive purpose of making a large Danish exhibit. S. Jonasen was elected chairman and F. Hansen secretary. The members took hold of the project enthusiastically and decided to make an exhibit that will be an honor to their country as well as to the exposition.</p>
<p>John Enkelod submitted a plan for a very picturesque pavilion in the old Dutch style, with steep, ornamented gables and lofty spires.</p>
<p>It is the intention of the new organization to secure financial assistance and recognition from the Danish government and to induce the greater number of the firms now exhibiting at Stockholm to ship their exhibits to Omaha in 1898.</p>
<p>A big mass meeting will beheld at Washington hall next Monday night, at which permanent officers will be elected and a committee appointed to wait on the board of directors of the exposition with a view to securing a desirable location for the pavilion.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">TRYING TO DISLODGE THE DRILL.</head>
<head type="sub">Workmen at the Artesian Well Have Not Given Up Hope.</head>
<p>The work on the artesian well at the exposition grounds is still at a standstill, but the contractors have not become discouraged. The big drill has been stuck since last Tuesday night and the men have been trying all sorts of schemes to get it loose, but without success. They say that they worked eleven days on the same sort of a job at Elmwood park and finally succeeded, and they will certainly get the drill out. The drill is stuck about forty feet from the bottom of the well.</p>
<p>It seems that the piping ran out, and instead of waiting for the new supply the contractors took chances and kept on working. Finally there was a cave-in and the drill was wedged in so tight that it could not be moved. Now the men are working around the drill with a smaller drill. While this is slow work, they expect that they will eventually dislodge the drill and be able to haul it up.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people went out to the exposition grounds yesterday and some of them stood and watched the drilling for hours. All the residents in that neighborhood have developed a tremendous interest in the progress of the well, and when the big drill is once more at work they will be as happy as the contractors.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">MANY APPLICANTS FOR SPACE.</head>
<head type="sub">California Wants to Show an Old-Time Mining Camp.</head>
<p>The Department of Exhibits is still doing a lively business and Superintendent Hardt is kept busy attending to the daily demands for space. This morning an application was received from James A. Love for a big concession for a representation of a California mining camp of the vintage of 1849. This was a creditable feature of the Midwinter Fair at San Francisco and will be reproduced at Omaha on an improved scale.</p>
<p>The first application from Iowa outside of Council Bluffs was received this morning. It was from the Iowa Tool company of Fort Madison, which wants 20 feet of floor space and 250 feet of wall space in the Manufacturers' building. Applications were also received this morning from the Moline Crystal Refrigerator company of Moline, Ill.; Evans Bros., Streator, Ill., mining tools, and J. E. Davis, Chicago, cider and wine presses.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">WORKING FOR MORE CONVENTIONS.</head>
<head type="sub">Plan to Secure Three More Big Gatherings for 1898.</head>
<p>Drs. Foote, Hanchett and Wood leave tonight for Buffalo, N. Y., where the will represent Nebraska in the annual session of the American Institute of Homeopathy that convenes this week. They take with them invitations from Mayor Moores, the Transmississippi Exposition directory, the Board of Trade and the Commercial club, urging that the meeting of 1898 he held in this city.</p>
<p>Secretary Wakefield wired W. H. Alexander at New York this morning to attend the National Convention of Music Teachers, which meets in New York tomorrow, and secure the 1898 convention for Omaha. None of the local musicians were willing to attend the convention unless their expenses are paid and the management will rely on Mr. Alexander to look after the interests of Omaha.</p>
<p>The department of promotion is preparing to try secure the 1898 convention of the National Florists' association, which meets at Providence next month.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">Testing the Lake Bed.</head>
<p>As the excavation for the lagoon is practically completed, the next question is whether the soil will hold water. Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds has had several experiments made with a view to testing this proposition and is convinced that the bottom can be made to hold water without difficulty. If it does not the department has several schemes on hand to remedy the difficulty, and if one fails to work another will.</p></div2>

<div2 type="article"><head type="sub">Nashville Exhibitors Coming.</head>
<p>Fred W. Rentfrow, who has just returned from the Nashville exposition, was at the headquarters this morning.

<head type="sub">Delegation Goes to Buffalo to Secure American Institute of Homeopathy for Exposition Year.</head>
<p>A delegation of homeopathic physicians of this state and Iowa left for Buffalo yesterday afternoon to attend the annual meeting of the American Institute of Homeopathy, which will be in session in that city for one week, commencing tomorrow. The particular purpose of the delegations is to secure for this city the 1898 meeting of this body.</p>
<p>Dr. W. H. Hanchett, chairman of a committee of the Nebraska State Homeopathic society that has in charge the securing of the meeting, is in charge the securing of the meeting, is in charge of the Nebraska delegation. This consists in addition to him of the following physicians: Drs. O. S. Wood, C. G. Sprague, P. C. Moriarty, R. W. Connell of this city, B. F. Bailey of Lincoln, G. H. Neal of Falls City, E. N. Leake of Fremont and B. F. Lang of York. The Iowa delegation will assist the Nebraskans. It is made up of the following: Drs. A. P. Hanchett and P. J. Montgomery of Council Bluffs, George Royal of Des Moines, James Gilchrist of Iowa City and C. A. Cogswell of Cedar Rapids. The delegation from this state is armed with letters of invitation from the governor of the state, the mayor of the city, the Transmississippi Exposition association, the Board of Trade, the Commercial club, the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben and many prominent citizens.</p>
<p>Dr. Hanchett stated before departure that a strong effort would be made to secure the gathering, but that some difficulty would undoubtedly be encountered from the fact that as the meting was being held in an eastern city, the eastern doctors wold be in the majority. He felt, however, that there was a good prospect for success. He and other members of the homeopathic school in this city have been working by correspondence for some time with a view to securing the support of other sections of the country.</p>
<p>It is stated that the national body contains on its rolls the names of some of the brightest, most scientific and eminent men in the states and territories of this country and of Canada. Ordinarily the members are attended by their families, so that the attendance is between 3,000 and 5,000. It is anticipated that if the railroads give a one fare rate to the exposition the meeting would call to this city from 5,000 to 8,000 physicians and members of their families.</p></div2>

        <p>A recent issue of a Chicago paper contained cuts of the Exposition Auditorium from plans made by a Chicago architect who was alleged to have been selected as the architect of the building.

        <p>The error in regard to the architects was due to the fact that when the concession for the Auditorium was granted to David Henderson, it was agreed that the Chicago architect should be allowed to design the interior of the building in order that it might be satisfactory to Henderson.  The concession fell through, however, and now the entire matter has been turned over to the Omaha firm.</p>

        <head type="sub">Woman's Board of Managers Take Steps to Erect a Structure that Will Be Used as a Nursery.</head>
        <p>The Girls' and Boys' building of the exposition has taken on definite shape, at least the committee of the Woman's Board of Managers, which was delegated to recommend a plan for the building, has decided upon a design which will be submitted to the executive committee to the executive committee of the woman's board at its meeting Thursday of next week and will also be <choice><sic>sumbitted</sic><corr>submitted</corr></choice> to a meeting of the full board to be held on the Friday and Saturday following.</p>
        <p>The committee having this matter in charge is Vice President Kimball and Directors Munroe and Cudahy.  The committee wishes it distinctly understood that this is not to be called the "Children's building," but is to be known as the Girls' and Boys' building.</p>
        <p>The plan decided upon by the committee shows a building of most pleasing design, the ground plan being in the form of the letter T, the stem of the letter forming the rear portion of the building.  The main portion of the structure is designed to be 100 feet in width and fifty feet in depth.  The stem, as at present contemplated, will run back fifty feet, but may be extended indefinitely as the occasion may require.  The building is well proportioned, but no attempt will be made at elaborate decoration.</p>
        <p>It will be a one-story structure with a "clear story" in the center of the main portion.  This arrangement will give plenty of room on the flat roof and this will be utilized for a roof garden and restaurant.  Across the front of the main portion of the building will extend a broad portico with tall columns, and from this entrance will be had to a large hall, 50x50 feet, with a dais at one side for speaking, entertainments, etc.  Up under the "clear story" will be a broad balcony commanding a full view of this main room, with stairs leading to it from two sides.  In each of the four corners of the main portion will be a room 25x19 feet in size.  One of these will be set apart for the girls and another for the boys.  The mothers will have the use of the third and the fourth will be devoted to an exhibit showing a model nursery.</p>
        <p>The rear portion of the building, the stem of the T, will be arranged as a creche, where children will be taken care of while their mothers enjoy the beauties of the exposition.  This room will be 50x50 feet in size and will be fitted with every convenience for caring for the little tots.  In one of the ells formed by the "stem" will be constructed a shallow pond, where the little fellows may wade and paddle to their hearts' content under the watchful eye of a vigilant attendant.  on the opposite side, in the other ell, will be a number of sand piles, where the little ones may build sand houses.</p>
        <p>A part of the exterior decoration of the building will be a handsome balustrade, extending around the cornice.  This will be surmounted by figures of cherubs supporting staffs, from which will be suspended appropriate banners.</p>
        <p>Those of the woman's board who have seen the drawings for the building have expressed the greatest pleasure at the beauty of the design and the handsome appearance of the structure.</p>
        <p>It is estimated that the building will cost about $5,000 and this amount is to be raised among the children of the transmississippi region.  The committee appointed to recommend a design for the building was also delegated to devise a plan for raising the money wherewith to build it, and several plans will be suggested to the executive committee and board of directors at the meeting next week.</p>

        <p>The Department of Exhibits of the exposition has received a very enthusiastic letter from the commercial agent of the department from Colorado, George M. Mischke.  He writes that he had an interview with Gov. Adams, in company with H. P. Steele of Denver, vice president of the exposition for Colorado.  The governor was enthusiastic regarding the matter of having Colorado represented at the Transmississippi Exposition and agreed with Messrs Steel and Mischke that a committee to serve without pay should be appointed for the purpose of securing county aid and arranging for an exhibit.  Mr. Steele recommended that Mr. Mischke be made secretary of this commission and that he be sent to every county in the state to secure the co-operation of the county commissioners.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mischke writes that Harry A. Lee, state commissioner of mines, has promised his hearty co-operation and says he will procure specimens from every mine in the state.  Mrs. Martha A. Shute, secretary of the State Board of Horticulture, has promised to secure an exhibit of the fruits and flowers of Colorado.</p>
        <p>Governor Adams is in correspondence with the following parties, who will be appointed as commissioners for Colorado, provided they will accept the appointment:  H. A.

        <head type="sub">Bureau of Agriculture Plans to Have a Great Meeting of Agriculturists at the Transmississippi Exposition.</head>
        <p>Prof. W. F. Taylor, superintendent of the Bureau of Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry of the exposition, is in correspondence with the principal officers of the leading societies of florists, agriculturists, etc., with a view of securing the 1898 meetings of these societies for Omaha.  He has received encouraging letters from the president and secretary of the Society of American Florists, which meets in Providence, R. I., August 17, this year, promising their co-operation in the matter of having Omaha selected as the place for the next meeting.</p>
        <p>The director of the agricultural experiment station at the Michigan State university, located at Lansing, has written to Prof. Taylor suggesting that an effort be made by the latter to secure the 1898 meeting of the American Association of Agricultural Colleges, which meets in Minneapolis July 13 this year.  The writer suggests that this meeting could be used as a nucleus for a congress of all persons interested in agricultural education with a view to securing a uniform plan of instructions.  Such a meeting has never been held, and Prof. Taylor says that there is a strong feeling in favor of getting together on such a proposition and crystallizing educational methods all over the country.  He will take the matter up at once and open correspondence with leading educators all over the country with a view of securing their co-operation.</p>
        <p>The people in the vicinity of Creston, Ia., have been in communication with Prof. Taylor with a view of arranging to erect on the exposition grounds a duplicate of the famous "Blue Grass palace," which has formed the center of attraction at Creston during the harvest celebrations.  It is proposed to have within this structure an exhibit of the resources of the region about Creston.</p>
        <p>Another suggestion which comes to Prof. Taylor from Iowa is from the vicinity of Glenwood.  The people there have been holding a gigantic "Apple carnival" each fall after the apples are ripe, and have attracted the people from every direction.  Prof. Taylor suggested to them the idea of not holding a carnival this year and making up for it by holding a monster affair on the exposition grounds next fall.  This suggestion was received with great favor among the

<pb n="189" xml:id="TMISB02-189"/>

people of Glenwood and they at once entered into the spirit of it. It is proposed to set aside two days and allow the people of that section to ship in tons upon tons of their luscious fruit to be distributed on the exposition grounds.</p>
<p>The Santa Fe Railway company has opposed the exposition from the beginning, but there are evidences that the opposition is disappearing. Prof. Taylor has been in communication with the land commissioner of that road with a view to having him make an exhibit of the resources of the southwestern country, through which that road passes. The commissioner appears to look with favor on the suggestion and Prof. Taylor believes that the Santa Fe will make a creditable display, representing the southern part of Colorado and New Mexico.</p></div2>

<p>The executive committee held a special meeting this morning for the purpose of taking action on these bids.

<p>The artesian well contractor is still fishing for his drill which is stuck at the bottom of a hole, over 700 feet in depth. The delay caused by this accident is becoming very annoying, as the exposition authorities are waiting the result of the experiment of boring a well before making definite arrangements regarding a water supply.</p>
<p>If the well gives a good flow, others will be put down and the lagoons supplied in this way, but if it is a failure, arrangements will have to be made with the water company for all the water that will be needed. If the latter course becomes necessary, a large amount of pipe will have to be laid to supply the several buildings and this can best be done before the erection of these buildings is commences. Moreover, if water is to be obtained from the water company it may be necessary to carry on extended negotiations for favorable terms. Several interviews with the management of the water company were held before the well project was suggested and the terms on which the company proposed to supply the exposition with water were not regarded by the executive committee as especially liberal.</p></div2>

        <p>WASHINGTON, June 25.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Senator Allen is pushing the scheme of mobilization of the regular and militia forces of the United States at Omaha next year to "beat the band."  He had a long conference with the attaches of the adjutant general's office of the War department today, going over in detail what was wanted by the people of Omaha to make the rendezvous a great success.  All this came about through the senator's <choice><sic>leters</sic><corr>letters</corr></choice> to the secretary of war and by the latter referred to the adjutant general's office for an opinion as to the feasibility of the scheme.  Senator Allen learned that to mobilize all of the militia of the United States and 30 per cent of the regular army at Omaha for a month would cost upwards of $3,000,000.  To mobilize 30 per cent of the militia strength of the country, which is figured at 220,000 men, it would cost $1,500,000, but to rendezvous 30 per cent of the regular army, or about 8,000 men at Omaha for a month would cost but $400,000.  The adjutant general did not take kindly to the militia idea for the reason that many stated have not got their national guard on anything like the efficiency of regulars, and to bring the state and regular soldiers together under these circumstances might work to the disadvantages of both.  The answer to Senator Allen's letter of inquiry will probably be ready Monday or Tuesday, and will be accompanied by such suggestions as the adjutant general's office deems necessary to make the mobilization.  If it is accomplished, a credit to the country.  Lieutenant Williams of the office dwelt particularly upon the proper water services and sewage in such a camp as is contemplated, which if carried out on anything like the plan proposed, will bring together a body of men such as the west has never seen under the direction of the War department.</p>

        <p>The Fort Wayne Electrical corporation has telegraphed for 2,160 feet of additional space in the exposition.  This makes the second additional application made by this company.</p>
        <p>The Reliable Incubator and Brooder company of Quincy, Ill., has applied for 400 feet of space upon which to exhibit six incubators in operation.</p>
        <p>The Felt &amp; Tarrant Manufacturing company has asked for space upon which to exhibit six of its comptometers and comptographs.</p>

        <head type="sub">Appointment Gives Satisfaction.</head>
        <p>The appointment of J. B. Dinsmore as commissioner of the Live Stock bureau is regarded with a good deal of satisfaction by the exposition management.  Mr. Dinsmore only consented to accept the position after a good deal of urging.  Manager Bruce believes that the selection will insure the success of the live stock exhibit.  Mr. Dinsmore has so long been identified with stock exhibits in connection with the Nebraska state fairs that he is well known to all the exhibitors in this part of the country.</p>

        <p>F. Stodiniger, Austro-Hungarian consul at New York, notifies the Department of Exhibits that he has been requested from Vienna to acquire all the information possible relative to the exposition and forward the same to the Treasury department at Vienna.</p>
        <p>C. H. Baxter has been made commercial agent for the state of Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>Prof. J. E. Wignan of the manual training department of the Omaha High school has been sent to New Haven, Conn., to attend the national training school convention and to secure the convention for this city next year if possible.  He left for the east yesterday.</p>
        <p>Fraser &amp; Chalmers of Chicago, manufacturers of mining machinery, steam engines and boilers, have asked the Department of Exhibits to reserve space for them until the return of the president of the company from abroad.</p>
        <p>The lumbermen of Tennessee are forming an organization for the purpose of putting in a collective exhibit, representative of the lumber interests of the south.  Their plans, so far as they are developed, contemplate a very interesting exhibit.</p>
        <p>The Department of Exhibits has received a communication from the secretary of the Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles, Cal., requesting the department to forward a diagram of the exposition buildings.  As soon as this is received the organization will decide on the amount of space that will be required for the big exhibit which the fruit and other interests of southern California propose to make.</p>
        <p>Secretary Wakefield has received a letter from W. J. Westerfield of Carson City, who was appointed vice president of the exposition from Nevada.  Mr. Westerfield writes that although the times are still hard in Nevada, the state will be creditably represented.  He will soon begin active work in behalf of the exposition and interest the leading men of the state in the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">The Exposition Directors Turn Down Union Labor at Last Saturday's Meeting.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Saunders, Wells, Carpenter, Wattles and Lyman Lead the Fight on Labor.</head>
                            <p>At a largely attended meeting of the board of directors of the Transmississippi exposition last Saturday a great portion of the time was consumed in setting down on labor, and teaching them the lesson that "they should be seen and not heard," or in other words, should comply with the demands to subscribe for stock to their utmost limit, pay their subscriptions promptly so as not to hamper the managers in importing, and in paying large salaries to "experts."  In their virtuous endeavors they might, at least, have let labor down easy and not with such a hard thud.</p>
                            <p>Should serious labor difficulties arise in the future, as a result of the indifference shown for the just claims of labor by this arrogant penny-wise directory, the public will open its eyes too late to see what is becoming more <choice><sic>apparant</sic><corr>apparent</corr></choice> daily to many, that the management of the affairs of the great enterprise has been placed in the hands of guilded mountebanks.  The Building Trades Council which is composed of all trades in the building line, has an agreement with the Omaha builders for the year ending June, 1898, to employ only union mechanics at the union scale.  In justice to themselves and the contractors of the city, the Building Trades Council urgently requested the executive committee of the exposition directory at a recent meeting to make provisions in letting the contracts, that the work should be done by union labor.  This request was turned down.</p>
                            <p>At the request of the Building Trades Council, Fred M. Youngs, labor's representative on the board of directors, introduced the following resolution at the director's meeting Saturday:</p>
                            <p>"Resolved, That all contracts entered into by this board, its officers or agents, for work pertaining to the Transmississippi and International exposition, shall stipulate therein that only union skilled labor shall be employed."</p>
                            <p>After Mr. Youngs had read the resolution, and before there was a chance to second it, a diplomatic move was made by Banker Lyman, who, without show of courtesy to Youngs, <unclear reason="torn"/> given to stockhol<unclear reason="torn"/> exposition association, or to those who were willing to become such, and that 10 per cent be withheld from the wages of the laborers so employed, and applied to the payment of their subscriptions until an amount had been withheld equal to the assessments already made, and that after that the assessments be paid in the usual way or withholding, the same rules as to efficiency to apply to stockholders as to others.</p>
                            <p>On being asked the object of the resolution Mr. Lyman stated that he believed it to be a good way to increase the subscription list.</p>
                            <p>Banker Lyman did not have the nerve to present a resolution to compel the directors to pay their assessments; he did not have the nerve to present a resolution to compel Section Foreman Geraldine and all his "expert" henchmen from the east to take stock in the exposition, and then take the assessment out of their wages.</p>
                            <p>Messrs. Kilpatrick and Hussie spoke against the resolution.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Youngs said he could see nothing in it of benefit to the laboring classes, as it was practically a scheme to force men to buy their situations, and he moved as an amendment that it be laid over until the next regular meeting so that labor might have a chance to discuss its merits.  The amendment was lost, and it was finally referred to the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Youngs then secured the floor and stated that time to get a second to his resolution had not been given.  Before he had a chance to go further President Wattles declared him out of order, stating there was nothing before the house.  Youngs said he had arisen to introduce his resolution and claimed the same right as accorded to other members, in prefacing it with a few remarks.  Although every motion or resolution offered at this and other meetings of the board had been prefaced with great spread eagle oratory, the labor representative was rudely shut off by President Banker Goldbug W. Wattles, who is said to have made an unenviable record over in Carroll, Ia., before coming to Omaha.</p>
                            <p>Youngs only succeeded in presenting his resolution by insisting on his rights as a director.  When his resolution was introduced a second time a silence fell on that distinguished assembly.</p>
                            <p>Labor's veteran trooper, "Cheap Wheat" Webster, sat mute at the left of the Carroll, Ia., presiding officer.</p>
                            <p>That horney-handed son of toil and enthusiastic friend of labor, Frank B. Hibbard, sat in silent prayer, beseeching for rain to assist the crops and the bucket shops, and keeping his mind fixed on the agricultural department of the exposition, which he will never get.</p>
                            <p>Section Foreman Geraldine had a man named Carpenter next to him and he was completely under the self-styled czar's hypnotic spell.  Carpenter was abiding the time when he could demonstrate that he was a carpenter by nature as well as by name, and could drive a nail to a nicety in the labor coffin.</p>
                            <p>And not last nor least, that self-avowed friend of labor, Jack Johnson, who never misses an opportunity to stop his labor friends on the street and tell them how much he would like to do for them, but&#8212;when the opportunity arose and he was personally requested to at least second this resolution in order to get it before the meeting, he hemmed and hawed, and finally flatly refused.  He, too, sat in silence, glaring at his brother heavyweight hauler, and friend (?) of labor, "Grasshopper" Jardine, who had a wonder-if-they-will-import-"expert"-haulers-from-Chicago look on his face.</p>
                            <p>Just as the president was going to pass to the next order of business, Dudley Smith, for decency's sake, seconded the resolution, as he said, "to get it on the rack."</p>
                            <p>Then the game opened.  Superannuated and fossilized Granddaddy Saunders, with tottering step led the grand march.  Notwithstanding that this <unclear reason="torn"/> the worst of it.  He moved to amend by referring the resolution to the executive committee, which was promptly seconded with a few sound whacks by one Carpenter, with his little hammer.</p>
                            <p>Before the amendment had time to be put Lucius Wells, a goldbug plutocratic snob from Council Bluffs who imagines that all workingmen are like his son-in-law, and whose head is swelled up like a toad over being called upon by the great moguls to assist in securing Gov. Tanner's signature to the Illinois appropriation bill, made another amendment that the resolution be tabled.</p>
                            <p>It was then that Granddaddy Saunders, on the sinner's bench, got in his fine work.  He said he was opposed to the consideration of any labor resolution whatever, and believed that they should all be referred to the executive committee, who, he was confident, "knew how to dispose of them."  He scoffed at the idea of adopting a resolution that would require men to belong to a labor organization in order to secure work, and he did not want this privilege taken away from him by the adoption of such a resolution.  He would oppose the amendment to table, as it was liable to be taken up again.  He wanted to see it killed for once and all, and if Wells would change his amendment to one for indefinite postponement, he would accept it.</p>
                            <p>This Lucifer Wells hastened to do, and stated that he was surprised that the board would take up so much time, and tolerated these labor questions longer than to vote them down.</p>
                            <p>Then he proceeded to take up more time than anyone else by making a long-winded speech, in which he distorted the facts, misrepresented the purport of the resolution, and said <unclear reason="torn"/>adopted it would bar Iowa <unclear reason="torn"/>s and workingmen, and <unclear reason="torn"/>e enterprise simply a Douglas <unclear reason="torn"/> fair.</p>
                            <p><unclear reason="torn"/>. Youngs in reply said that the resolution was being misconstrued; <unclear reason="torn"/>ts adoption would not give home contractors or workmen any advantage over those in Iowa or elsewhere, but would place all on an equal footing, and protect home contractors, who <unclear reason="torn"/> agreed to employ union labor, from disastrous competition with out-<unclear reason="torn"/> contractors, who could underbid <unclear reason="torn"/> if allowed to employ inferior <unclear reason="torn"/>labor.  All skilled and proficient <unclear reason="torn"/>ics were members of trades <unclear reason="torn"/>and those on the outside were <unclear reason="torn"/>tent and not eligible to mem-<unclear reason="torn"/>  The adoption of the resolutions would guarantee the exposition management a high grade of work, which, when all things are taken into consideration, would be best for the interests of Omaha, Nebraska and the Transmississippi states.</p>
                            <p><unclear reason="torn"/> Youngs said he believed that m<unclear reason="torn"/> of the directors did not understand the objects of the labor unions; that they were not a local band of anarchists, but skilled artizans organized for the advancement of mechanical arts, and to<unclear reason="torn"/> a just remuneration for their ser<unclear reason="torn"/>.  He said he believed the people in general were in favor of organized labor, as it was being demonstrated locally by our largest labor employ<unclear reason="torn"/> and also by many large business <unclear reason="torn"/>ations which in the erection of their buildings and plants, stipulated that none but union labor should be employed in their construction.  <unclear reason="torn"/>stice to show whom the boar<unclear reason="torn"/>ents he asked that the amendment be voted down and the resolution adopted.</p>
                            <p>W<unclear reason="torn"/> amendment to indefinitely postpone was carried, Fred M. Youngs being the only man who voted in the negative.</p>

                            <p>The impudence and unwarranted arrogance of ex-Senator Saunders has borne fruit, just was we expected it to do.  The insulting intolerance of him and his gang on the directory toward anything emanating from the working people, has aroused the latter to action.  If this old nonentity could be made to bear the responsibility of the bad feeling he has created it would be less matter, but his utility as a director of the exposition or his value as an ornament to that body is not apparent to the keenest perception in the community.</p>
                            <p>The following preamble and resolutions <choice><sic>wore</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> unanimously adopted at a meeting of the Omaha Building Trades Council held in Labor Temple on Thursday evening.  After reading them we feel like congratulating Mr. Saunders and his high-flying associates as Henry VIII did Cardinal Wolsey when he handed him his dismissal: "Here, take this and read it, and then to breakfast with what appetite you have."  The exposition directory has behaved so shamefully toward the working people of Omaha that the public will place the responsibility where it belongs and condemn the directory as the authors of any trouble arising from their venal and idiotic conduct.</p>
                            <p>Here is the official manifesto, it is red hot and means business:</p>
                            <ab>OFFICE OF <lb/> BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL <lb/> OF OMAHA AND VICINITY.</ab>
                            <p>Whereas, A request has been made by this Council of the executive committee of the Transmississippi and International Exposition company to make provision for the employment of organized labor in the construction of their buildings, which request has been refused consideration by them, and believing that a just recognition of organized labor will entirely obviate the strikes and delays which it would seem from the experience of every other similar enterprise heretofore is a necessary concomitant, therefore, be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the building Trades council of Omaha does hereby demand of the exposition committee <unclear reason="torn"/>ployment of none b<unclear reason="torn"/>t skilled mechanics in their respective lines of work; because to become a member of a labor union a man must be proficient in the avocation which he follows.</p>
                            <p>Second&#8212;It will serve to bring to our city only those mechanics who are past masters at their trades, men who are intelligent and conservative, men who are not easily led to make unjust and unreasonable demands of their employers, men whom every employer and merchant can heartily welcome to remain with us after the exposition is over.</p>
                            <p>Third&#8212;It will place all competing contractors, whether of this city or elsewhere, on an equal basis in making their bids, without materially increasing the cost thereof.</p>
                            <p>Fourth&#8212;The employment of union labor insures a greater immunity from loss or delay on account of strikes or disagreements between employer and employe.</p>
                            <p>Fifth&#8212;It will insure the placing of contracts in more responsible hands, thus securing the exposition company from <choice><sic>embarrasing</sic><corr>embarrassing</corr></choice> delays and loss on account of adventurers, for it is a well established fact that any contractor who habitually employs incompetent workmen will at every opportunity possible take undue advantage of them and also his client.</p>
                            <p>Sixth&#8212;Many members of labor unions and their sympathizers have subscribed liberally to the enterprise and, therefore, feel that they are justly entitled to recognition in its construction; and as the laboring element forms by far the larger portion of the people from whose patronage is to be derived the success of the undertaking, anything which will benefit them will certainly insure that that success will be greater.</p>
                            <p>Seventh&#8212;That in making this demand, we do not do so with any intention, as many have supposed, of keeping any mechanic who can secure employment, from coming to work on the exposition buildings, but to insure for him the enjoyment of the privileges and benefits secured to him by the union of the trade at which he works, or, in other words, we desire that the way be opened to all GOOD mechanics all over the United States, or elsewhere, where our unions have affiliations, that they may be benefited by the moderate restrictions of their respective trade unions.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, it is now proposed to ask the voters of Douglas county, to vote bonds in the sum of $100,000 to be used in aid of the Transmississippi exposition, therefore be it also,</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That a petition be circulated for the signatures of members of trade unions in this city to read as follows:</p>
                            <p>We, the undersigned citizens and workingmen who sympathize with organized labor, do hereby pledge ourselves that in the even that the executive committee of the Transmississippi and International Exposition Company complies with the demand made by the Building Trades Council of Omaha, that in letting contracts for the construction of their worst provision is made requiring that mechanics belonging to trade unions be employed, to do all that honorably lies in our power to secure the passage of the bonds by Douglas county, Neb., in the sum of $100,000, for the aid of the Transmississippi and International Exposition.</p>
                            <p>But in the event that said executive committee refuses to make the provision as above stated we pledge ourselves to do all that honorably lies in our power to defeat said bonds.</p>
                            <p>Be it further resolved, That a copy of the above resolutions signed by the president and secretary, with the seal attached, be placed in the hands of each member of the executive committee of the Transmississippi and International Exposition company, and that the secretary cause to be printed and placed in the hands of the <unclear reason="torn"/> of t<unclear reason="torn"/>ns t<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>Rev. John Williams celebrated the 20th anniversary of his ministry in St. Barnabas' church on Tuesday last <unclear reason="torn"/> inviting as many of his people as could conveniently come to meet him at the alter on that day.  The rector of St. Barnabas is very much like our army officers who get old and grayheaded before they reach the rank of captain owing to slow promotion in there "weak, piping times of peace."  The rector of St. Barnabas is pugnacious and militant enough, but he always fights on the side for which promotion never comes.  His Master was crucified for like services, but was well pleased to go through the ordeal if His death would compass the desired result.  And so we suppose Mr. Williams is perfectly satisfied with his old ram-shackle church and poverty stricken surroundings, believing that he can save souls there better, perhaps, than under the chimes of Trinity where the people enjoy their cushions.  Promotions will be slow for such ministers as he.  They are too near to God and the common people, not time-serving enough and lacking in their worship of mammon.  Ah, well, their names and deeds are recorded in the book of life, where many fashionable and eminent preachers will have no page to their credit and this fact we suppose makes lowly surrounding sweet and endurable.  THE WESTERN LABORER extends congratulations to Mr. Williams and wishes him many happy returns of the anniversary day.</p>

                            <head type="sub">THE DIRECTORY AGAIN.</head>
                            <p>When the Exposition directory was first organized we said that if the city had been raked over in search of tricksters, sharks and shysters, no more successful effort could have been made.  As far as they have gone on with the exposition business their every move has been marked with crookedness, nepotism, backscratching and grabbing.  We were fully aware that the working people of Omaha had few friends there, but we did not expect that these "cormorants" would have the audacity to jump onto labor interests here with such unanimity as they did at their meeting last Saturday.  Even Hussie, whose father is a union iron molder, voted down Youngs' resolution to employ union labor on the Exposition work.  Saunders, who went to the United States senate "busted," and came back a rich man, able to pay his debts with the fruits of his honest labors for the railway corporations, was especially severe against the Youngs resolution, and that people's party apostle, Frank Hibbard, who is said to be responsible for the naming and appointing of Dunham, also voted against union labor.  It is said Hibbard's back is to be scratched with an appointment to the head of the agricultural department in return for his influence in Dunham's appointment.</p>
                            <p>The resolution presented by Mr. Youngs was not of his framing; it was the desire of the building trades that he should present their wishes upon the kind of labor that should be employed.  Mr. Youngs was only the mouthpiece of the masses of our people, both business men and working men, who have it in their power to teach the directory, who have treated them so badly, a lesson they will not soon forget.</p>
                            <p>We prophesied when this directory was organized that such a clique could not be decent and reasonable if they tried, seeing what they have been engaged in heretofore, and we now prophesy a little more, that the exposition will not open in 1898&#8212;that the <unclear reason="torn"/>board of directors will ever <unclear reason="torn"/> exposition, as there will not be enough plums to go around among the relatives of the directors alone, Mr. Lindsay having only six relatives on the pay roll up to now, it is said; but he may live in hopes of getting a few more on.</p>
                            <p>One of Omaha's citizens, an old tax payer, applied for the position of storekeeper and was induced to subscribe $20 to the exposition, but Mr. Lindsay brought a relative up from Plattsmouth and he got the situation.</p>
                            <p>As far as the Youngs resolution is concerned the building trades are not to be bluffed by such old toads as sat down upon it, and if the directory is as anxious for a wrestle with organized labor, as their course on last Saturday would indicate, why then they will be accommodated without much trouble.</p>
                            <p>We had hoped that this great enterprise would be carried out without any clashing of forces, and that harmonious effort would be crowned with success; but since ignorance and arrogance seem disposed to lower their heads and present their horns to us, why we must teach them that we know how to meet them without pulling off our shirts to do it.  Organized labor in Omaha now knows what kind of people they have to contend with, and when the proper time comes we will give them an ocular demonstration that we know how to deal with this class of men who have been so insulting and arrogant.</p>

                            <head type="sub">LOCAL LABOR SITUATION.</head>
                            <p>The Omaha Bee quotes us as saying that there are more men employed in Omaha than there were this time last year, in justification of the daily papers inducing men from all sections of the country to flock to Omaha in search of work.</p>
                            <p>The fact of a few more men being now employed than have been for some time past, does not help the many thousands belonging here, and who have been "holding the fort all winter." to get employment.  And anybody knows that a large influx of idle men would make their prospects worse.</p>
                            <p>We have no desire to play the dog in the manger or hog everything in sight, but we persist in saying that "charity begins at home."  And now a case in point.  An Omaha man has just received a letter from his brother at Baker City, Mont., who is on his way here from that state with an hundred other men and teams to get to work on the exposition.  In the letter he says the promoters while in Montana told the people that it would be impossible to get men in sufficient numbers in Omaha to build the exposition on time, and the consequence of this lie is that all the men and teams are now between Boise City and Omaha on their way here.</p>
                            <p>When they arrive here are the exposition managers prepared to put these teams and men to work, or will these people who have been lured here have to sell their teams in order to live and pay their expenses home again?  The laying off of the little force that has been employed on last Saturday night is not very promising, though we know they must be hired again, seeing that so much money will be spent here on the great show anyhow.</p>
                            <p>If the Bee will investigate in the right places it will be found that the brickyards have no orders for bricks other than the few buildings we have referred to before.  The proper place to find how "prosperity" is blooming is from the brickmakers, contractors and architects, where a different tale is told than the one told by the daily papers.</p>
                            <p>We are all standing up for Omaha, but let us get up easy and have some regard for truth and save some of the trouble and suffering we may bring upon others by our misrepresentation of facts regarding the Omaha labor market.</p>

                            <head type="sub">AN OBJECT LESSON TO WORKINGMEN.</head>
                            <p>There is an object lesson to be received every day by the working people who think there is no use in organization.  This lesson is to be had on the Nebraska Clothing Co.'s new store at 15th and Farnam streets, where two classes of men are employed by two different firms.  The bricklaying and carpenter work is being done by union men who work eight hours per day.  The bricklayers "tenders," or hodcarriers, of course, work the same hours as the bricklayers do.  The lesson to be learned is in the better conditions the organized men enjoy over those of the unorganized men.</p>
                            <p>When 7 o'clock a. m. arrives the unorganized men begin work.  When 8 o'clock arrives the union men begin work.  When 5 o'clock arrives the union men quit, their day's work is over, but the unorganized men have to work up to 6 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>The unorganized men are Paxton &amp; Veirling's men engaged in putting up the iron work.</p>
                            <p><unclear reason="torn"/>that union<unclear reason="torn"/> gets the largest wages as well as the shortest hours.  Yet while we pitied them we could not help that thinking that they were deserving of no better fate.</p>
                            <p>If you ask one of these unfortunate wretches why they don't organize, they will tell you that they cannot afford it; that they could not pay the nominal sum that is required by the union as dues; that they could not afford to pay a dollar for a labor paper for a year.  Yet the same worn out abused creatures will spend several times the sum in "rushing the can" Saturday nights.</p>
                            <p>When we think of the stupidity of these unorganized men we cannot help concluding that they are getting what they deserve for their folly and blindness in not appreciating the advantages of trades unions over their self-degraded condition.</p>
                            <p>Organize, you chumps, organize!</p>

                            <p>In the conviction of Embezzler Joe Bartley, Mr. Howard H. Baldrige has added another leaf to his professional wreath.  He was confronted with perhaps the ablest lawyer in the state for the defense, but all his technical obstructions and exceptions were swept away and overcome by the cool and deliberate force of the county attorney's well sustained arguments and determined to do his duty to the people of the state.  Mr. Baldrige's career has been marked with wonderful success when compared with that of his predecessors in the same office, and the indications are that he will have little trouble in climbing to the supreme bench through the public recognition of his ability and devotion to duty.  In the Bartley case he was well supported by C. J. Smyth and Ed P. Smith, and Judge Baker is being complimented on all sides for the manner in which he presided over the case.</p>
                            <p>A few more such convictions and summary punishment will teach public thieves that there is no escape from the consequences of their crimes when tried in Douglas County and prosecuted by Baldrige.</p>

                            <ab>EDITORS WESTERN LABORER:</ab>
                            <p>It is somewhat fresh and healthy in these days of gold worship and expatriation to find that even your correspondent, "Antiquated," deplores the change in public feeling since he sat at the feet of respected teachers who taught the patriotic duties of American citizenship, the deeds of "Marion's men," of Stark, Putman, Wayne and Washington, and how they overthrew the power of England and built the republic.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Antiquated grieves that our school books have been mutilated and robbed of every lesson that would inspire the American boy and girl with the spirit of Patrick Henry, who demanded for himself "liberty or death."  Let me ask your correspondent where was he when foreign conspiracy seized every board of education they could capture and put those schools under the control of English agents from garret to cellar, namely, into the control of Scotch, Canadian and English orangemen?  Why should Mr. Antiquated grieve at the ruin accomplished before his eyes, even if he did not lend his vote to the consummation of the plot?  But now he whines over our degeneracy when he must know that his silence gave consent to the ravishing of the school books of everything that was inspiring to the pupils.  Was his voice heard or his pen used in the defense of these school books from this British attack upon the historical and patriotic lessons of the revolution in our school readers, or to prevent the elimination of historical events from our school histories that would offend our not very sensitive cousins across the water and the Canadian line?  All these changes were made with the avowed object of saving the public schools from a certain influence, and now our friend has grown sad at the effects of this emasculation.</p>
                            <p>What has been substituted for the glorious deeds recorded and principles enunciated by the revolutionary fathers, who, like Ethan Allen, believed that the Almighty God and the Continental congress was a superior power to that of the king of England or any power on earth?  Flag worship has taken the place of patriotic history; this fetish worship has been inaugurated by hypocrites who neither love our flag nor our institutions, but are here for the "bawbees" and the betterment of their condition.  Their anxiety to celebrate sixty years of robbery, cruelty, bloodshed and chicanery by the most perfidious nation on earth, is evidence of how deep is their hearts' attachment to the flag they prate so much about but have never fired a shot or struck a blow in its de<unclear reason="torn"/>dowed by deeds of later days&#8212;and especially by achievements in subduing the wilderness and the more difficult prairie.  We will hear of the railroad, the telegraph, telephone, the electric plant, and all the wonderful things of modern days, but not one republican or democratic orator will tell you we are subjects today of that power that cost so much to escape from 121 years ago.  They will not tell you that every dollar you pay as a tariff goes to English money lenders.  They will not tell you the English can gather to their coffers all the products of the farm, and factory, and shop, and still invest in the few remaining utilities belonging to Americans.  You will not be told that 45,000,000 acres of land belong to foreign owners; that you can't take a drink of muddy water from a hydrant in Omaha, or a ride to Council Bluffs without paying tribute to a foreign country."</p>
                            <p>"Thou fool, that which thou soweset that shalt thou surely reap."  We have sown the wind and will reap the whirlwind of course.  The orator of the day will not be your neighbor, the head selectman of the township, but will be introduced to his audience as "the Hon. &#8212;, a rising young lawyer, whose silver tongue will entrance his hearers with its patriotic eloquence."  And so the Hon. "Silver Tongue," who seeks in the fall and ruin of his country the course for him to rise in and the opportunity to betray a confiding people, next week receives a nomination and election to office where he basely betrays his trust for the money of a syndicate or that of the foreign bondholders of a great corporation.  And still, in the face of a yearly repetition of this farce, Mr. Antiquated wonders how such things can be, although he has been watching them take place with as many eyes as the writer and for as many years.</p>
                            <p>Your correspondent knows very well that it is the practice to select lawyers for nearly all offices within the g<unclear reason="torn"/> of the people from governor down <unclear reason="torn"/> police commissioner.  He knows that this class of men have the special privilege of an elastic conscience and cannot dishonor themselves by s<unclear reason="torn"/> barefaced chicanery and bold perversion of facts as has been practiced <unclear reason="torn"/> Mahoney in the Bartley case.  If Mahoney had succeeded in defeating <unclear reason="torn"/> ends of justice, the public would proclaim him clever, and assert that he would make a splendid United States senator, because he was able to <unclear reason="torn"/> the law and protect a th<unclear reason="torn"/> penalties of his crime.</p>
                            <p>Why should men with pra<unclear reason="torn"/> consciences ever be entrusted <unclear reason="torn"/> public office when no dishonor <unclear reason="torn"/>come to them in the public eye <unclear reason="torn"/> matter whether they make <unclear reason="torn"/> white or not.  If Mr. Antiquated <unclear reason="torn"/> turn back a leaf or two of his m<unclear reason="torn"/> he will find that he and I are <unclear reason="torn"/>cause of the things which he so <unclear reason="torn"/> laments, and until we cease pla<unclear reason="torn"/> politician and play "square m<unclear reason="torn"/> these things will grow worse and <unclear reason="torn"/> suffering more acute.</p>

The Labor Temple directory are anxious about the result, and feel confident that the printers will protect its interests.</p>
                            <p>The executive officers of 190 sent a request to the C. L. U. at its last meeting for the appointment of a committee to work on the Festner, South Omaha Journal and Sun strikes.  The committee is to be paid $3 a day each by 190.  T. M. Conway, C. W. Porter and J. B. Schupp are the committee.</p>
                            <p>At the last meeting of the executive board Manager Hitchcock of the promotion department succeeded in securing an increase of $5 per week for his chief clerk, E. C. Hunt, and endeavored in the absence of Mr. Rosewater to have J. B. Haynes, Rosewater's assistant, cut down $20.  The latter motion was laid over until Mr. Rosewater returned.</p>
                            <p>Sam Nedrey has married a Washington Salvation army lady and enlisted in the soul-saving army in the bargain.  I would like to peep into the barracks window when Sam has the floor and see and hear him make this familiar appeal:  "Won't some good man, in the name of God, hold up his hand with a dollar in it, and I will come down and get it myself."</p>
                            <p>For the edification of President Lindsley, I clip the following from a Kansas City letter in the Chicago Federationist:  "The following resolution was passed at the last meeting of 80:  'We hereby indorse the candidacy of M. C. Byrne as one that will prove acceptable to organized labor of Kansas City; and further, we herewith earnestly request Gov. Stephens to recognize union labor by appointing Mr. Byrne coal oil inspector at Kansas City, Mo.'"</p>
                            <p>At the union meeting tomorrow of 190 it is thought the proposition to suspend the election lay will carry and that nominations for the various offices will be made.  There is not the old-time hustling and electioneering that we use to have when delegates were elected.  Since that part of our ballot has been dropped the elections are "tame sports."  The delegate elections put life into the union and it became all the stronger after a hot campaign.  I am in favor of returning to annual convention after Prescott is unloaded.</p>
                            <p>After a struggle of several years Jesse Johnson has at least been elected president of the International Printing Pressmen's union.  First vice-president, John W. Williams, Toronto; second vice-president, Frank Pampusch, Minneapolis; third vice-president, Robert H. Kelley, Boston; secretary, James Gelson, New York; delegates to A. F. of L. convention, James J. O'Day of New York, and G. T. Leinheins, Philadelphia.  Robert J. Sawyer, editor of the American Pressman, must be jealous of Bramwood's graft, for he "touched" the convention and landed a Thanksgiving lift.</p>
                            <p>At the last convention the executive council was instructed to prepare a plan to collect I. T. U. revenue by the percentage system.  The plan they have prepared is printed in the late Journal.  It provides that the dues to be collected by the local unions shall be 2 per cent of the earnings; 1&#0188; per cent to go to the I. T. U. and &#0190; per cent to remain the local treasury.  The dues of 190 are now 1 per cent of the earnings with a rebate of 25c to those who attend meetings, and the per capita tax is taken out of that, leaving enough in the local treasury to more <unclear reason="torn"/> horses," and occasionally help the sick.  If this law is adopted 190 will have to pay nearly <hi rend="bold">$150</hi> per capita tax per month&#8212;nearly three times as much as we pay now.  This is a matter that should be well attended to by every member of the union.  It is a hold-up and must be butchered!</p>
                            <p>The Western Chronicle office has been using the label though it is not entitled to it, because the men in that office are not members of the union.  A few days ago, so Wm. Grabach informs me, the stage employes had some handbills and their constitution and bylaws printed at the Chronicle office.  They printed all their reading matter in the book on their own press and then took the cover up stairs to McCoy's and had them set up and print the cover with the label on, conveying the impression that the whole thing was a union job.  This is considered a clever trick by some people, but instead it is a coarse violation of the Allied Trades council rules.  If the label rules are going to be run in such a loose manner, it is only fair to let the men who are paying dues to 190 in the game first.  The McCoy office had no right to become a party to that deception, and, for that matter, the McCoy office has no right to use the label, because no active member of 190 is working in that shop.</p>

Take anything that's cool and comfortable these days&#8212;and it doesn't take sweltering humanity very long to find out where is the best place to buy it.  Witness our white Duck Pants.  Witness our linen Crash Suits.  Two weeks ago we had five hundred linen suits for men&#8212;enough, we thought, to last all season.  Today we haven't got one.  Where did they go?  They went on the backs of men who knew a good thing when they see it.  While other stores were trying to get $3.50 and $3.75 for theirs, The Nebraska was selling 'em at $2.00 and $2.50.  Result:  we haven't got any now.  We will have another invoice of them in a very few days&#8212;maybe today&#8212;and those who were disappointed in getting here late will have a chance to catch on.  Meantime we are selling those splendid Serge Light Coats at $1,90, and those fine Vicuna and Mohair Coats and Vests at $2.25 and $2.75.  Perhaps you paid twice that for yours in some other store, but that's not unusual.  Don't get excited about it.  Take things cool.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, June 28.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;President McKinley, either through the Executive department or through the Department of State, will call attention of foreign governments to the exposition to be held in Omaha next year.  Senator Thurston was instrumental in bringing this highly decorated action about.</p>
                            <p>On Saturday the junior senator from Nebraska had an interview with the president along the lines of the Allen senate resolution introduced last week, calling upon the president to make an official proclamation of the Transmississippi Exposition.  The State department taking the stand it did regarding the matter and the committee on ways and means of the house being opposed to the precedent which the concurrent resolution set, there was nothing else left but to seek presidential aid, and this Senator Thurston did.  The president examined the senate resolution as proposed be Senator Allen and after some time, in which the whole history of the exposition was gone over, Mr. McKinley gave the junior senator from Nebraska to understand that either from the Executive or the State departments a proclamation would issue in behalf of the Omaha exposition.  This assurance being given, one of the first things done in the senate this morning was to pass Senator Allen's resolution, introduced on Saturday, calling upon the executive to take official cognizance of the great show to be held in the Gate City next year.</p>
                            <p>Representative Mercer filed with the Postoffice department today a petition of business men of South Omaha, asking for an increase in the carrier facilities of the Magic City, and the showing made was of such a high character that in all probability three additional carriers will be given South Omaha about July 1.  He also put in a strong plea for increased mail service, and this will probably be granted, an extra mail delivery being considered.</p>
                            <p>The Danes of Omaha held a meeting at Washington hall last night to consider ways and means for a national exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition.  S. Jonason was made temporary chairman of the meeting with S. Schilsby secretary.  A couple of hours were passed in discussing an appropriate exhibit.  It was proposed that a model Danish farm in which the dairy products of the country shall be displayed be the main feature.  This suggestion met with the approval of the majority present, and upon a vote it was decided to appoint a committee to take charge of the matter.  The committee is composed of the following:  S. Jonason, S. Schilsby, J. Enkeboll, J. Rasmussen, H. Asmussen and S. F. Neble.</p>
                            <p>A corporation will be formed, known as the National Danish Exhibition company, and it is proposed to interest Danes throughout the United States in the scheme.  The plans so far are immature, but it is thought that the displays will cost in the neighborhood of $15,000.  Circulars and illustrated pamphlets will be printed with drawings of the exhibit, and these will be sent by the committee to every prominent Danish society in America.  The committee will hold another meeting in the near future at which the plans will be discussed at greater length.</p>

This makes another important convention to be added to the already long list of national gatherings which have selected Omaha as their meeting place for next year.  The American Institute of Homeopathy has a membership of about 1,500.  There are in attendance at Buffalo about 300 members and it is expected that the Omaha convention will be attended by about 500.  Nearly all of the members bring their wives with them and the convention remains in session about seven or eight days.

                            <head type="sub">County Commissioners and Managers of the Agricultural Society Discuss the Question of an Issue of County Bonds.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The Board of Managers of the Douglas County Agricultural society held a conference this morning with the Board of County Commissioner on the subject of the voting of $100,000 by the votes of Douglas county in aid of the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
                            <p>All but two of the representatives of the agricultural society were present, and all of the county commissioners took part in the discussion, which was held in the consultation room of the commissioners.</p>
                            <p>President Oscar J. Pickard of the Agricultural society acted as spokesman for that organization and informed the commissioners that he and his associates had appeared before them for the purpose of arriving at some understanding regarding the conditions which should be thrown around the appropriation of the county before the proposition is submitted to the voters.  He said the society wished to learn the sentiment of the commissioners as to the construction which should be placed upon the act authorizing county aid, especially on the point as to how and by whom the money should be expended.</p>
                            <p>G. W. Hervey, one of the representatives of the agricultural society, then read the first section of the act of the legislature, authorizing the issuance of bonds.  He maintained that the word "therefor" as occurring in the section quoted referred to "county exhibit" and he said the members of the agricultural society were desirous of seeing that the agricultural interests of the county were fully protected and they took the position that it was the intent of the legislature that the money appropriated should be used for that purpose.  He said the agricultural society did not desire to act as a discordant element, but he suggested to the commissioners that there is strong opposition among the rural population against voting bonds in aid of the exposition.  He said that the proposition could not be carried if it was proposed to turn the proceeds of the bond issue over to the exposition management to be expended by them.  He said the society had no proposition to make, but was satisfied to leave the whole matter in the hands of the commissioners.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">PROTECTING COUNTY INTERESTS.</head>
                            <p>Commissioner Kierstead assured the representatives of the agricultural society that the interests of the county would be fully protected by the commissioners.  He said there was no probability of any special election being held.  The commissioners were in favor of submitting a proposition to the voters of the county for the full amount if the necessary petition was presented.  He called attention to the fact that by the terms of the act of the legislature it is provided that if two-thirds of the votes cast on the bond proposition are in favor of it the proposition shall be declared carried without reference to the number of votes cast at the election.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hervey resumed the floor to say that the society appreciated the fact that the commissioners would protect the interests of the county.  He said the commissioners were appealed to by "an interest not altogether favorable to the agricultural interests of the county" and the society desired to present the claims of the agriculturists for consideration.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Stenberg of the commissioners called attention to the fact that the interests of Douglas county are varied and are not confined to agriculture.  He reminded the visitors that the county has large manufacturing interests, which are as much entitled to consideration as the farming community.  Taking up another line of argument, Chairman Stenberg said he construed the law to be mandatory on the point of making a county exhibit.  He referred to the standing of this county, from an agricultural standpoint, and said he was strongly in favor of having the county make the most favorable showing of all its resources and would hold to the position that this was the intent of the law.  Mr. Stenberg also referred to a rumor which he said had reached him, to the effect that the agricultural society would like to have charge of the expenditure of the $100,000.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SOCIETY WILL HELP.</head>
                            <p>This soft impeachment was immediately denied by several of the delegation, and Mr. Hervey said the society had no more interest in the matter than any other individuals.  He said the society, as a body, had taken no action in the matter, but the members simply appeared before the board as individuals.  He intimated, however, that if the commissioners should see fit to call on the agricultural society to carry out a part of the purpose of the law the society would gladly take hold of the matter.</p>
                            <p>It appeared from the general trend of the talk of the visitors that some of them were in favor of a separate county building.  Commissioner Kierstead announced his opposition to any such plan.  He said the object of the law could best be served by aiding in the erection of one or more main buildings of the exposition, either the Agriculture or Horticulture buildings, so that the exhibit of this county might be compared with those from other states more readily.</p>
                            <p>James Walsh of the agricultural society said the members of that organization were not in favor of a separate building.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Ostrom drew from several of the delegation the statement that they were opposed to the idea of turning any of the money over to the exposition managers to be expended by them.</p>
                            <p>The matter was discussed at considerable length by all parties, but no conclusion was reached, it being agreed, however, that before definite action is taken by the commissioners, the agricultural society shall be consulted.</p>

                            <head type="sub">New Law Extending the Powers of Counties.</head>
                            <p>Under the provisions of a special act, passed by the last legislature, counties in Nebraska are authorized to participate in interstate expositions held in the state and to issue bonds for the purpose of defraying the expenses of such exhibits.  Bonds may not be issued to exceed $100,000 in any one county, and shall be sold at par and draw not to exceed 5 per cent interest per annum.  Whenever 1,000 voters petition the board of county commissioners or the board of supervisors to that end a special election may be called and the question of issuing such bonds submitted to a vote of the people.  If two-thirds of the votes cast on the proposition be in favor of the bonds they shall be issued and sold, otherwise not.</p>
                            <p>This act was passed especially that counties of the state might vote bonds and make exhibits at the Transmississippi Exposition that will be held in this city next year.  Already several of the counties of the state are considering the feasibility of submitting the bond question to the voters, that funds may be secured to pay the expenses, securing and placing on exhibition the products of the soil.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Vassily Ebell Appointed to Represent the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>Vassily Andrejevitch Ebell, who has just been commissioned by the Department of Exhibits of the Transmississippi Exposition to work up a Russian village as one of the exhibits for the exposition, was born in Vassily Ostrow, May 28, 1859.  He is the son of a well-known stock broker of the St. Petersburg exchange, and received his early  training and impressions about a palace on the banks of the Little Neva, where he familiarized himself with foreign flags and tongues, seeing the many vessels from all parts of the world.</p>
                            <p>At the age of 13 years he was placed in the St. Petersburg Commercial college from which he graduated in May, 1877.  At his graduation he was awarded a diploma and received the rank of "Honorary Citizen of St. Petersburg," and bachelor of commercial sciences.  He acted as interpreter at the World's fair to the principal imperial Russian commissioners and other officials and visitors from the land of the czar.  His efforts in making them acquainted  with American industrial institutions culminated in many shipments of American machinery to Russia.  His services were such as to bring to him credentials of a character to eminently fit him for the position for which he has just been chosen in connection with the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ebell has decided to call his exhibit "In Joyful Russia," after the book written by John A. Logan, jr., and in which he will endeavor to depict Russia as it is, to take away the erroneous impressions of that country created by the writings of George Kennan.  He will leave Omaha in a short time to begin the work of arousing interest in the exposition among his own countrymen and friendly Slav nations.</p>

Erwin, Sioux City, are the guests of the Board of Directors of the exposition today.  The morning was spent in showing the visitors the progress made in actual work on the project.  The members of the commission were escorted to the headquarters in the Paxton block about 10 o'clock this morning by Director Wells of Council Bluffs and Vice President Wright of Iowa.  Here they were met by a number of the members of the executive committee and of the Board of Directors.  A brief time was given

                            over to getting acquainted, after which the visitors were shown about the offices of the several departments and the progress of the work was made known to them.  The entire party then proceeded to the offices of Walker &amp; Kimball, architects-in-chief, where the visitors were shown the plans of the main buildings and of the grounds, and about an hour was spent in going over these plans.  Several members of the commission represented their state in the same capacity at the World's fair, and have had considerable experience in exposition work.  These men examined the plans with great care and evident satisfaction.  Very little was said, but from remarks of a brief nature it was apparent that they were favorably impressed both with the general design of the arrangements and with the progress which has been made.  Several of them expressed their approval of the excellent architectural effect obtained by the manner in which the plan of the grounds has been arranged.</p>
                            <p>After examining the plans the visitors were escorted back to the headquarters, where they congregated in the directors' room.  Here President Wattles reviewed the conditions surrounding the exposition somewhat at length and explained just what has been done in a financial way and what is in prospect.</p>
                            <p>At noon the visitors were entertained at lunch at the Omaha club and the afternoon was devoted to a visit to the exposition grounds.</p>

                            <p>The law passed by the last legislature providing for the appropriation of $100,000 to enable the state to participate in the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha in 1898 becomes operative in a few days.  The fund is to be disbursed by a board of six commissioners, one from each congressional district, each commissioner to receive for his services $50 per month, and no more, the time for which each member may draw pay not to exceed fifteen months.  No part of the state appropriation is to be available until the stockholders of the exposition shall have paid in at least $200,000.  The money appropriated by the state is to be controlled and managed solely by the commissioners.  Within sixty days <unclear reason="torn"/> close of the exposition it is made <unclear reason="torn"/> the commissioner of public lands and buildings to advertise and sell at public auction all the property acquired by the board of commissioners.</p>

                            <p>The Transmississippi Troopers held their maiden drill last night, the four blocks of level ground at Twentieth and Spencer streets being used as a drill ground.  The streets abutting on this ground was filled with people in vehicles who were attracted by the sight of the squad of troopers going through the interesting maneuvers of the cavalry drill under the instructions of Colonel C. F. Weller.  The drillmaster served in the cavalry during the late war and he put the recruits through their paces with the air of a veteran.  A number of the troopers have served in military organizations of various kinds and with their aid the drill had less of the aspect of the "awkward squad" than is usually the case with a new organization.  The drill lasted about two hours and was only discontinued when the gathering darkness made it difficult to execute the maneuvers with precision.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, June 20.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Assistant Adjutant General A. L. <unclear reason="torn"/> in charge of the <unclear reason="torn"/> department, has forwarded to Senator Allen detailed plans <choice><sic>fro</sic><corr>for</corr></choice> mobilizing the militia of the United States, and a portion of the regular army at Omaha next summer.  While General Wagner looks upon the concentration of the national guard at the exposition with favor and from a military point of view, as of almost incalculable benefit, he thinks such a gigantic undertaking would be fraught with much doubt and uncertainty, if an attempt was made to concentrate the whole forces of the militia.  He thinks also that these guardmen, while being a great attraction to the exposition, would attract a large influx of visitors to the camp, which would interfere with the proper performance of camp duty.  Then he discusses the scheme of mobilization of the National Guard, dividing the states of the union into nine groups for instruction, to be brought together later in one grand camp.  General Wagner takes up the subject of concen- Wagner takes up the subject of concentrating the Guard of Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and the two Dakotas with one-third of the regular army next summer, which, he believes, could be accomplished without any great outlay of money, maintaining these troops, say 15,000 in number, for months at an approximate cost of $698,921.  As a substitute plan, in case the foregoing should be deemed too expensive, General Wagner suggests that the states of Nebraska and Iowa be requested to assemble their National Guard at Omaha and the general government concentrate at that point one-third of the regular army.  "This plan would be practically it would be simple, and it would be at least a beginning in the direction of combined instruction for regulars and militia," says the adjutant general, "and this concentration would cost on the part of the general government $440,405, if Nebraska and Iowa would assemble their troops for summer encampment at Omaha in the usual way."  He also suggests that the assembled troops be under command of a major general of the regular army; the regular force to be divided in two brigades, each being commanded by a brigadier general and the National Guard being similarly organized in brigades.  In an appendix to his letter General Wagner estimates that to concentrate the guard of Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and the two Dakotas at Omaha for two weeks would cost $180,316, including transportation, subsistence, camp grounds and tentage.  He thinks that for a month the same force could be subsisted for $258,516, exclusive of the cost in mobilizing one-third of the regular army.  Senator Allen will present the letter to the senate tomorrow and ask that it be printed.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Formation of Plans for Various Congresses on the Program for Discussion&#8212;Much Work in Sight.</head>
                            <p>The Woman's Board of Managers of the exposition will hold its regular quarterly meeting at the exposition headquarters at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.  It is thought likely that the board will be in session at least a part of Saturday.  All that has been done by the executive committee of the woman's board since the last meeting of the main body will be brought up for consideration and approval, and it will also devolve upon the board to authorize the formation of plans for the various congresses which will be held under its direction, and the carrying out of the same.</p>
                            <p>In preparation for this meeting of the board, the executive committee convened this morning for the purpose of making up a report to be presented to the main body covering the work that has been done and making such recommendations as were deemed advisable.</p>
                            <p>Nothing has yet been done in the way of planning for congresses or agreeing upon the particular sort of congresses that shall be held.  This matter will undoubtedly be one of the subjects which will be discussed by the board.  It is more than likely that a musical congress will be one of those agreed upon.  This action follows the failure to secure the convention of the Music Teachers' National association.  A letter received from Homer Moore conveys the information that the convention refused to fix upon Omaha as the place for the 1898 meeting.  This action is attributed by the writer to the tactics adopted by the president of the association, who is also the head and front of the American Conservatory of Music in New York City.  It is charged that the president packed the convention with pupils of the conservatory and allowed them to vote on the question of location, thereby defeating the true sentiment of the convention.  It is also asserted that the association is on the verge of disruption and that the most prominent members will withdraw.</p>
                            <p>Some of the members of the woman's board have expressed the sentiment that a musical congress should be held in Omaha in connection with the exposition.  In the letter of Mr. Moore, heretofore referred to, he states that a number of the most prominent musicians in the country have signified their willingness to assist in every way in carrying out a successful congress, and it is thought that more can be accomplished in this way than could have been done with the presence of the national association.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Exhibits of the Transmississippi Exposition is daily in receipt of amended applications from exhibitors who have made application heretofore, asking that they be allowed more space.  This is taken as an indication that the exhibitors are being awakened to the magnitude of the proposed exposition, and are anxious to secure a large amount of space before steps are taken to restrict exhibitors.  Manager Bruce is already seriously considering the necessity for enlarging the main buildings beyond the size originally agreed upon.  Applications for space are being received in such great numbers that nearly all available space in

                            some of the buildings has been taken.  Fortunately, the main buildings are designed in such a way that the wings may be extended almost indefinitely without interfering with the symmetry of the design and without adding greatly to the cost of construction.</p>
                            <p>Among the applications received today by the Department of Exhibits was one from the Rock Island (Ill.) Plow company, through its western agent, P. S. Hawley of Lincoln, Neb., asking for 5,000 square feet of space.  Thompson, Belden &amp; Co. of this city made application for 200 feet for William Little &amp; Co. of New York City; Green, Wheeler &amp; Co. of Fort Dodge, Ia., made application through T. P. Cartwright, commissioner for the shoe and leather section, for space for a display of leather goods; the Le Maitre Optical company made application for space for an exhibit, this being the ninth application received for an optical exhibit; the St. Joseph (Mo) Pump company and Wiltzius &amp; Co. of Milwaukee, dealers in church goods, each made application for an additional space.  The E. H. Pease Manufacturing company of Racine, Wis., notified the department that its representative would meet the manager of the department within a few days to make arrangements for an extensive exhibit of mill machinery.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles stated this morning that he was greatly pleased with the result of the visit of the Iowa exposition commission to Omaha yesterday.  He said that after the members of the commission had been shown all there was to see in connection with the progress which had been made they expressed themselves in the most satisfactory manner and were most favorably impressed with the general appearance of energy and determination to make the exposition a success.</p>
                            <p>The visitors were unanimous in saying that Iowa should be represented at the exposition in a creditable manner, and the majority of them favored recommending to the Iowa legislature an additional appropriation of at least $65,000 in order that Iowa's participation might be on a scale commensurate with her direct interests.</p>

                            <p>The plans and working drawings for the Manufactures and Liberal Arts building will be completed today, and copies will at once be made for distribution among prospective bidders.  The plans for the Mines and Mining building are well under way, and these will be completed within a short time.  Bids for the Manufactures building will be asked at once.</p>
                            <p>There is brisk competition among bidders for the contracts for these main buildings.  Fully fifty copies of the plans of the Administration building have been sent out in response to requests from contractors at all points in the country who desire to make a bid on the construction.  The Administration building is a comparatively small structure, the cost approximating about $10,000, and it is expected that competition will be much livelier on the other main buildings, the cost of which will run up to about $75,000.  Every opportunity is being afforded local contractors to bid on these buildings, but they find themselves in direct competition with experienced exposition contractors in all parts of the country, and it is predicted by those who are posted that the figures will be made on a very close margin of profit to the contractor.</p>

He proposes to travel overland from Boise City, Idaho, to Omaha by way of Ogden, Denver, Salt Lake City and Denver to Omaha, starting next February and having every burro wear a banner advertising the Transmississippi Exposition.  After his arrival in Omaha he purposes to operate his train, carrying the children about the grounds on the burros or in the stagecoach, which will be drawn by ten of the little animals.  He lays down the proposition that he can draw a larger crowd with his fifty <choice><sic>hurros</sic><corr>burros</corr></choice> than can be collected by a brass band.  The department is disposed to look with favor on this proposition on account of the comparative novelty such a peculiarly western product would be to eastern visitors.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The Transmississippi commissioners for Iowa held a long and busy session at Council Bluffs last evening.  All of the members of the commission were present.  Hon. George F. Wright, vice president for Iowa, was present as an interested spectator.  President Mallory of Chariton presided.</p>
                            <p>The early part of the evening was devoted to an informal discussion of the impressions the members had received during their visit to Omaha in the early part of the day.  It developed that each members had acquired enlarged ideas of the extent, scope and character of the exposition and the energy and capabilities of the men who are pushing it along.  One of the first important matters taken up for discussion and solution was the best means of acquainting the people of Iowa with the magnitude of the exposition and the importance it was to be to the state.  Secretary Chase produced a circular letter which the Iowa Columbian commissioners had printed by thousands and sent broadcast all over the state, and he suggested that a similar document be prepared and printed in sufficient quantities to enable the commissioners to send copies to all of their correspondents and to every newspaper editor in the state, with a request to have it appear in the papers with suitable editorial comment.  S. D. Cook of Davenport, R. H. Moore of Ottumwa and J. E. E. Markley of Mason City, the three newspaper men on the commission, favored the idea and felt warranted in expressing the belief that such a circular would be generously treated by the Iowa editors.  The other commissioners took them at their word and a motion was put and carried that they be appointed as a special committee to prepare the circular letter.</p>
                            <p>When Secretary Chase opened a large packet of letters and documents he ran into a large number of applications for appointment to various positions at the disposal of the <choice><sic>commisisoners</sic><corr>commissioners</corr></choice>.  Among the applications that the commissioners considered to be worthy of consideration was a numerously signed petition asking that Bell &amp; Kent of Council Bluffs be designated as the official architects of the commission.  The petition bore the names of many prominent people throughout the state.  It was received and placed on file for future consideration.</p>
                            <p>The matter of deciding upon the form of letter head the commission would use was referred to the secretary, who submitted a number of sketches.</p>

                            <p>The secretary submitted a communication from Hon. Lafe Young, president of the Iowa Press association, calling attention to the fact that the association had determined to accept an invitation from the Nashville <unclear reason="torn"/> the excursion about August 27.  The cost for the round trip would be very small, and the editors would be given an opportunity to see the exposition and afterwards would be the guests of the Nashville people and be taken on a tour over the Tennessee battlefields, down as far as Atlanta and back through Kentucky to the Mammoth cave.  He thought it would be a good idea for the commission to accompany the editors, get acquainted with them and get them interested in the Transmississippi enterprise and stir up their enthusiasm while looking at the Nashville exposition.  The invitation was accepted, and considerable discussion followed as to whether the commissioners should go in their official character and have the state bear their expenses or whether they should go as individuals and bear their own expenses.  It was finally decided that as the expense was only $11 each should pay his own way, but should be accredited as the official representative of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>A. F. Coleman of Corning asked to be appointed as superintendent of the fruits exhibit.  Mr. Coleman had charge of the Iowa exhibit at the World's fair after the State Horticultural society had made a failure of it, and made it successful at the last moment.  Commissioner Packard urged his appointment and suggested that no time should be lost in making arrangements for this character of display, as a great deal of time would be required to <choice><sic>prepared</sic><corr>prepare</corr></choice> for them.  The application was placed on file with a view of being taken up later.  L. G. Clute of Greeley, Delaware county, asked to be made superintendent of the agricultural department, and his application went the same way.</p>
                            <p>The commission then went into executive session for the purpose of considering the resignation of Secretary Chase and the appointment of his successor.  L. G. Clute was the most favored candidate and the prospects were excellent that he would be appointed.</p>
                            <p>The commissioners will hold sessions today.</p>

                            <p>Prof. F. W. Taylor, superintendent of the Bureau of Horticulture, Agriculture and Forestry of the exposition, is in correspondence with the foreign growers of sugar beet seed, with a view to having them make exhibits at the exposition, showing the method used in propagating the seed for these beets.  He states that encouraging replies have been received from several of these growers and he feels confident that a number of them will make exhibit.  The professor says that the cultivation of beets for seed purposes is as carefully conducted as the breeding of fine stock.  In brief, the plan is about this:  The best looking beets are selected from the crop and a small portion is taken from each beet and subjected to a test for saccharine properties.  If the test reaches the standard the beet is laid away until the next planting time.  Those not passing the test are thrown into the pile with the common lot.  The seed beets are planted the following year and carefully nurtured and permitted to "go to seed."  In this manner the sugar-producing qualities of the beets have been raised to a higher percentage.  Prof. Taylor hopes to have these foreign growers who make a specialty of raising seed come to the exposition,, and he expects to make these exhibits the source of prolific information to the growers of sugar beets in this section.  He says there is no reason why the best sugar beet seed in the world should not be raised in this immediate section of country, and he proposes to utilize the exposition as a means of instructing the seed growers in this region in the most approved methods adopted in Europe as the result of many years of experimenting.</p>
                            <p>Prof. Taylor is also in correspondence with the makers of beet sugar machinery, with a view of having a model plant in full operation on the exposition grounds in connection with the exhibit of seed growers.  He states that he has no doubt but that a complete plant will be established on the grounds and be in full operation during the season when beets are obtainable.</p>

                            <p>The committee appointed at the meeting of representatives of the local German societies last Friday night to take the preliminary steps toward the organization of a German village or resort at the exposition met yesterday and made a thorough canvass of the situation, which resulted in a very definite idea as to the general features of the project.  The committee has applied to the Department of Concessions for two acres of ground, which will be entirely devoted to the purpose.</p>
                            <p>The idea of making a complete German village was abandoned as impracticable, but the space will be converted into a resort which will present all the attractions of the popular summer gardens of the Fatherland.  A commodious pavilion will occupy a part of the ground.  The first story will be occupied by the restaurant and cafe and the second floor will be a large hall devoted to the uses of the various German societies.  The center of the hall will be ornamented with a handsome fountain and a German military band will discourse music every day.  The surrounding grounds will be attractively set out with shrubs and trees, with numerous pretty arbors.  Bowling alleys will be among the attractions and another will be a cafe where the fair sex can supply themselves with tea, coffee, cakes and other light refreshments.  This is the general plan of the resort as now determined on, but it is expected that various other valuable features will be added as the enterprise develops.  The committee will probably recommend the organization of a stock company to carry out the scheme and another general meeting will be held at Turner hall next Friday night.</p>

                            <p>Up to this time subscribers have been slow to respond to the appeal of the executive committee to pay their subscriptions in full in order to increase the total to the desired amount.  Half a dozen holders of one, two or three shares have responded promptly, but few of the larger subscribers have taken advantage of the offer of 5 per cent rebate for full payment.  Aside from the Burlington railway, the only other subscribers of more than $100 who have paid in full are Dan Farrell, jr., who made a full payment of his subscription of $1,000, and the Nebraska Fuel company, which paid in its full subscription of $750.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Transportation has arranged with the Missouri Pacific Railway company for a switching charge of $4 per car for "setting in" a car on the exposition grounds.  The average price for switching to various points in the business district is about $2.  It is understood that the switching charge to the exposition grounds, like switching charges to other points, will be absorbed by railroads over which exhibits or materials are shipped and will not be an additional charge on the exhibitor or contractor.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Contract for Erecting Administration Arch Will Be Let Tomorrow.</head>
                            <head type="sub">OTHER STRUCTURES TO FOLLOW QUICKLY</head>
                            <head type="sub">Staff-Covered Buildings Put Together Rapidly and a Transformation Scene Will Soon Occur on the Grounds.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The work of erecting the buildings for the Transmississippi and International Exposition will soon be in full blast and the residents of Omaha will be treated to an exhibition of rapid construction which will knock all preconceived notions into a cocked hat.  The rapidity with which these staff covered exposition buildings can be erected is marvelous to those who have not had an opportunity of seeing the work done.</p>
                            <p>The contract for the first of these buildings, the Administration arch, will be let Tuesday of this week.  Bids for the construction of the Manufactures and Liberal Arts building will be opened July 15, and the plans for the Mines and Mining building are being pushed as rapidly as possible.  These will be completed within the next week or ten days and another building will be at once taken up.  In this way it is hoped to have all the main buildings well under way before fall and the construction of the smaller buildings will then be pushed as rapidly as possible.  These will be completed within the next week or ten days and another building will be at once taken up.  In this way it is hoped to have all the main buildings well under way before fall and the construction of the smaller buildings will then be pushed in the same vigorous manner.</p>
                            <p>The office of the architects-in-chief presents a very busy scene during these warm days.  A large force of draughtsmen is busily engaged in working out the details of construction, following a uniform scheme in the erection of the framework of the several buildings.  The drawings are duplicated by the hectograph process, the ordinary method of making blue prints being entirely too slow owing to the large number of copies of each drawing required.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">STAFF HANDLED LIKE BOARDS.</head>
                            <p>There is a general impression that the construction of staff buildings can only be carried on during warm weather and that the first frost will being the work to a complete standstill.  Architect-in-Chief Kimball says this is a mistaken notion.  He says these buildings can be erected in any kind of weather without any more drawbacks than would obtain in the erection of a building covered with boards.  Mr. Kimball says staff is a mixture of plaster of paris, some kind of hemp fibre, and, usually, a small quantity of cement.  This substance is molded in large <choice><sic>slabe</sic><corr>slabs</corr></choice> and after it is dried is handled in the same way as a board of the same size, being fastened in place with nails.  The casting of these slabs is the operation which requires warmth to successfully complete, but after the work is once completely dried the weather has little effect upon it during the <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>When the erection of the main buildings commences the contractors will establish their "staff planes" on the exposition grounds for the manufacture of these slabs.  It has been decided that the buildings shall be given the tint of old marble and the staff turned out of these factories will be colored to produce this effect.  These "slabs" will be on an immense scale and many of them will be works of art in themselves.  Intricate carving and classic sculpture will be imitated to a nicety and the artistic effect produced by the finished buildings will be such as could only be found otherwise in the most beautiful buildings of the old masters.  Statuary of heroic size will surmount some of the main buildings and these will all be done in staff.  The imposing columns of the long colonnades and of the beautiful porticos facing the main court will be constructed of the same lowly material.  The handsome bas relief sculpture adorning the pediments of the main buildings will be moulded of staff and the lions couchant and rampant surveying the main court from their lofty pedestals will be poured out of a huge pot and not won from the bowels of mother earth by the hand of the sculptor.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PARK BOARD READY TO WORK.</head>
                            <p>The conditions precedent to a participation by the Board of Park Commissioners in the work of improving the exposition grounds have at last been complied with and within a few days the necessary papers will have passed giving the city the title to the eleven acres of land which will be known hereafter as Kountze park.  When this is done the park board will at once begin active work, co-operating with the exposition management.  The board will expend about $30,000 this year in beautifying the grounds and will expend an additional amount next year.  This eleven acres forms the center of the Kountze tract of forty acres.  Half of the eleven acres was donated to the city by Mr. Kountze, and the other half was purchased by the exposition association and presented to the city for park purposes.</p>
                            <p>Dudley Smith of this city has been appointed by the exposition management as commissioner general to Great Britain and will start for Washington Wednesday of this week, accompanied by Mrs. Smith.  In Washington Mr. Smith will be supplied by the Department of State with credentials to the British government, and his principal endeavor will be to induce that government to appoint a commissioner to the Transmississippi Exposition and make a government exhibit.  If this is done it is expected that a very salutary effect will be produced upon English manufacturers and a much larger number of exhibitors thereby secured from that country.  Mr. Smith will be absent until some time in September.</p>
                            <p>The laying of railway tracks into the exposition grounds will be commenced this week and by the time the contractor for the Administration building is ready for his material the tracks will be ready for use in setting his cars just where he wants them.  These tracks will run along the north and south sides of the main court at the rear of the main <choice><sic>bulidings</sic><corr>buildings</corr></choice>, and will be used for hauling in material to be used in the construction of the buildings and, later, for hauling exhibits directly to the buildings in which they are to be installed.</p>

                            <p>These particular tracks are to be laid by the Missouri Pacific and will connect with the Belt Line tracks near the junction with Sherman avenue.  They will cross Sixteenth street at right angles with the street and will pass along the bluff tract.  Other tracks will probably be laid on the grounds by the Northwestern company, whose tracks are about as near to the exposition grounds as those of the Missouri Pacific.  The Missouri Pacific will make a switching charge of $4 per car for all cars placed on the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>The artesian well contractor has been having considerable difficulty during the past week or ten days in recovering his drill and grappling tools which were lost at the bottom of the well, a distance of over 700 feet below the surface.  The drill was lost first and shortly afterward the grappling tools were likewise lost while attempting to get hold of the drill.  The accident was caused by too much haste.  The supply of pipe with which the well is lined as fast as the hole is pushed toward the center of the earth, became exhausted.  Not wishing to lose time by waiting until another supply of pipe was received, the contractor continued drilling without lining the hole.  As a result the drill became fastened at the bottom of the hole and the rope used to operate it was broken.  A grappling tool was sent down the hole to recover the drill but the earth tumbled into the hole and the grappling tool was held fast.  About this time more pipe was received and work was resumed in the regular manner, pushing the lining down to where the tools were fast.  It was reported yesterday that the tools had been recovered and that work had been resumed.  it is expected that a heavy flow of water may be struck at any time.  If the well proves a success others will be at once put down for supplying the lagoon with water during the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DRAWINGS OF THE ADMINISTRATION ARCH</head>
                            <head type="sub">Architects Complete Their Work, Showing a Picture of the Structure Which Will Be Headquarters for Exposition Receptions.</head>
                            <p>The perspective drawings of the Administration arch have been completed by the architects.  This is the first perspective of the main buildings which has been completed, but the others are in hand and will be placed before the public in a short time.  These drawings will give the general public the first tangible idea of the appearance of the buildings.</p>
                            <p>The attractive features of the Administration arch give promise of the beauties which may be anticipated.  The drawings show a beautiful building designed along the "free classic" style, which dominates all the buildings on the main court, but the French renaissance stands out more prominently in this particular building than in any of the other main buildings.  The Administration arch is 50x50 feet on the ground and is 150 feet in height.  It is intended to be used as a general headquarters for the reception of distinguished visitors, besides giving a finished effect to the architectural ensemble of the main court.  It is much taller than any of the other buildings on this court and forms the central figure of the group of buildings facing the lagoon.</p>
                            <p>In general effect the building is a solid rectangular mass with four rectangular spires surmounted by a high hipped French roof and lantern.  The drawing is in black and white, and while it gives the silhouette and detail in strong lines it leaves the color effect to the imagination.  On the building itself, color will be used freely.  In the loggias all the half lights and under the arches color will be used with freedom and strength.  The contrast between the lower, solid portion of the building and the roof will also be emphasized by the free use of colors.</p>
                            <p>To heighten the architectural effect statuary of heroic size will be used above the cornice.  On each of the four spires will be four symbolic figures, and at the center of the south side, facing the lagoon will be a group symbolizing "administration."  Models for these figures have already been prepared by Sculptor Mettler, who had been engaged on them for several weeks.</p>
                            <p>The space beneath the roof of this building will be utilized <choice><sic>a as</sic><corr>as</corr></choice> a location for the chime of<unclear reason="covered"/> bells for which a concession has already been<unclear reason="covered"/> cornice will be an open space which will b<unclear reason="covered"/>asked.  Between the roof and the main<unclear reason="covered"/> utilized as an observation place for surveying the grounds, this being above the roofs of the other buildings.</p>
                            <p>The drawing in question also shows a portion of the colonnade or <choice><sic>perisyle</sic><corr>peristyle</corr></choice> which connects the Administration with the Agriculture buildings on the west and the Miner and Mining building on the east.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Project Considered by Executive Committee of Commercial Club.</head>
                            <p>A movement is on foot to celebrate a Nebraska day at the Tennessee centennial at Nashville.  The object is to promote the social and the commercial intercourse between Nebraska and Tennessee and to enlist for the Transmississippi exposition here next year the aid of those who have made the Nashville centennial a success.  The matter was presented to the Commercial club's executive committee at this afternoon's meeting and received the unqualified endorsement of that body.  The project was recommended to the exposition directory for further action.  The matter came up in the form of a letter from J. M. Whitaker of the state auditor's office at Lincoln.  He stated that correspondence between a number of Nebraskans and the authorities of the Nashville centennial had brought out a cordial invitation from the latter to Nebraska to celebrate a day of its own there.  The freedom of this city has been proffered and the authorities have announced that they will admit, on that date, all Nebraskans free of charge.</p>
                            <p>It is proposed to run a special train, bearing as many Nebraskans as will agree to go to the Nashville show.  The latter part of September is the time now in view by the prime movers of the excursion.  William J. Bryan whose presence has been urged, has stated that he will go on such an excursion at that time.  It is also believed that Governor Holcomb, Senators Allen and Thurston and other distinguished citizens of the commonwealth will join the party.  The Commercial club will co-operate with the Transmississippi Exposition directory in an endeavor to promote the success of the proposed excursion.</p>
                            <p>A letter was received from a traveling salesman of an Omaha house, recommending that an excursion be run from Quincy, Ill., to Omaha on the occasion of the completion of the new railroad that is being built.  It was suggested that invitations be sent all the merchants and other tradesfolk of points along the line between the two plans to join such an excursion to this city.  The railroad committee of the Commercial club will look after this project and endeavor to make it a go.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Congressman Mercer Suggests that the Matter Be Taken Up.</head>
                            <p>Congressman D. H. Mercer has suggested to the exposition authorities that arrangements be made at an early date for the medals for awards and also for souvenir medals, which are to be made by the federal government.  Mr. Mercer states that the director of the mint attributes the usual delay in getting medals for expositions to the fact that the management usually waits until the medals are wanted before ordering them, with the result that there is a long delay in their receipt.  This matter will be taken up by the executive committee and it is probable that the souvenir medals will be ordered in the near future.</p>

                            <p>The Woman's Board of Managers of the exposition convened in regular session at exposition headquarters this morning with all the members present except Mrs. McDowell of Fairbury, Miss Chase of Papillion and Mesdames Harford and Cudahy of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. A. J. Sawyer of Lincoln, president of the board, delivered an interesting talk to the members on the importance of the duties devolving upon them and the necessity of earnest co-operation.  The address of the president was along broad lines and was calculated to arouse the enthusiasm of the members of the board and dispel any feeling of lack of interest which might exist.  She outlined very briefly the general scope of the work which devolved upon the woman's board and made numerous suggestions regarding the work to be done.  The address was favorably received and the members manifested their approval by a dainty clapping of hands.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Ford made a verbal report of the conference had with the governor by the president and secretary, acting as a special committee for that purpose, regarding the appointment of the state commission and the protecting of the educational interests of the state.  The governor was reported as saying that he would see to it that the commissioners to be appointed should give the interests represented by the women proper recognition.  The committees appointed to attend the meetings of the National Kindergarten association and the Drawing Teachers' association for the purpose of securing those meetings for Omaha in 1898 reported their failure and the reasons for it.</p>

                            <p>Secretary Ford read the report of the executive committee, covering the work that had been done since the last meeting of the board.  The portion of the report bearing on the Girls' and Boys' building, a description of which was given in The Bee two weeks ago, received the closest attention from all the members of the board and formed the subject of discussion until the noon adjournment.  The plan as a whole was enthusiastically endorsed, some of the minor details forming the subject of prolonged discussion.</p>
                            <p>The report of the committee described the building itself somewhat in detail.  Drawings showing the elevation and plans were shown, the details being explained by Vice President Kimball, chairman of the special committee which originated the idea.  The remainder of the report was devoted to an explanatory circular, which is being prepared with a view of sending it broadcast over the west.  This circular explains the plan by which it is proposed to raise the $8,000 or $10,000 necessary to erect the building and decorate it in a suitable manner.  It is proposed to ask the girls and boys of the transmississippi region to subscribe to the stock of this building, the shares being 5 cents each.  An individual or school subscribing for twenty shares will receive a handsome certificate of stock, and individuals or schools subscribing for 200 or more shares will be placed on the roll of honor to be displayed in the building.  The interior of the building will be embellished by handsome pictures, and these will be awarded at the close of the exposition to the schools contributing the largest subscriptions of stock.  In making these awards schools in the country and those in the cities and towns will be grouped in separate classes.</p>
                            <p>The latter section of the circular formed the subject of considerable discussion, and it was finally decided that in making these awards to schools, the decision should be based on the per capita amount subscribed.  It was also decided that a charge should be made for caring for children in the creche sufficient to cover the expenses of a matron and attendants.</p>
                            <p>The board will be in session until some time tomorrow.</p>

                            <p>Manager Babcock of the Department of Transportation is giving the greater part of his time to getting the work of his department under way.  Up to this time there has been little to be done, but with the immediate prospect of active work on the grounds his department is called into action and the question of transportation becomes a live issue.  The matter of putting construction tracks into the main court of the exposition was arranged yesterday, as announced in these columns, and the question of railway terminals will be the next matter to be taken up.</p>
                            <p>It has been practically determined that the railway entrance to the exposition grounds shall be on the north side of the old fair grounds, but the intricate details of connections have not yet been determined

                            upon.  The Omaha Street Railway company is also preparing to take up the question of reaching the grounds, and a committee of the directors has been appointed to confer with Manager Babcock regarding the arrangement of street railway terminals at the grounds.  Until this is agreed upon no plans can be made by the company regarding the extending of its tracks to the grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Commissioners Meet at Council Bluffs, Complete Their Preliminary Work and Are Highly Pleased at the Outlook.</head>
                            <p>At Council Bluffs the Iowa exposition commissioners completed their work yesterday afternoon and adjourned.  They left for their homes last evening.  They spent a busy day arranging the details of their work and appointing the committees that will have charge of the various departments.  It was decided to make no change in the secretaryship at present, Secretary Chase having consented to withdraw his resignation.</p>
                            <p>A good portion of the day was spent in considering special features and the best means of bringing the people of Iowa to a proper realization of the great importance the Transmississippi Exposition will be to the state, and creating a sentiment that will make it possible to secure an appropriation from the legislature that will be sufficient for the needs.  The very lowest figure that any of the commissioners fixed for this amount was $50,000, and the majority of them favored an appeal to the legislature for $90,000 in addition to the $10,000 already appropriated.</p>
                            <p>The commissioners decided to appropriate $800 to be drawn upon at once for the use of the committees having in charge the work of preparing the fruit, grain and grass exhibits.  This work will be largely under the direction of Mr. Coleman of Corning, Ia.</p>
                            <p>After the adjournment last evening the members of the commission were willing to talk freely upon the subject of the exposition and give their impressions.  Commissioner Cook of Davenport said:  "We are going to make just as strong a report as we can, and use every means at our command to make it certain that Iowa's show at the exposition will be creditable to the state.  It's our ambition to make it exceed in magnitude, beauty and attractiveness that of any other state.  We have been brought to strongly realize the fact that this exposition will be of greater benefit to the state of Iowa than was the World's fair at Chicago, and we realize the necessity for making a larger and in every way better display than we made there.  Every member of the commission is enthusiastic over the outlook, and we will all go home with the intention of doing our part to make it a success."</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Markley of Mason City, said:  "We are satisfied, after our conferences with the Omaha men who have the management of the big enterprise that they have fully realized the magnitude of their undertaking, and that the <choice><sic>managemnt</sic><corr>management</corr></choice> is in capable hands.  We came here believing that the Omaha men were simply preparing for a big state fair, but we are now satisfied that they realize they have a world's fair on their hands, and will not fail in any part of their duty in making it the success it should be.  We are satisfied that we can induce the members of the legislature next winter to regard the enterprise in the same favorable light that we do now, and get an appropriation commensurate with the importance of the event."</p>

                            <head type="sub">METHOD TO BE SHOWN AT EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Prof. Taylor Takes Steps to Interest the Beet Seed Growers of This and Foreign Nations.</head>
                            <p>Prof. F. W. Taylor, superintendent of the Bureau of Horticulture, Agriculture and Forestry of the exposition, is in correspondence with the foreign growers of sugar beet seed, with a view to having them make exhibits at the exposition, showing the method used in propagating the seed for these beets.  He states that encouraging replies have been received from several of these growers and he feels confident that a number of them will make exhibits.  The professor says that the cultivation of beets for seed purposes is as carefully conducted as the breeding of fine stock.  In brief, the plan is about this: The best looking beets are selected from the crop and a small portion is taken from each beet and subjected to a test for saccharine properties.  If the test reaches the standard the beet is laid away until the next planting time.  Those not passing the test are thrown into the pile with the common lot.  The seed beets are planted the following year and carefully nurtured and permitted to "go to seed."  In this manner the sugar-producing qualities of the beets have been raised to a higher percentage.  Prof. Taylor hopes to have these foreign growers who make a specialty of raising seed come to the exposition, and he expects to make these exhibits the source of prolific information to the growers of sugar beets in this section.  He says there is no reason why the best sugar beet seed in the world should not be raised in this immediate section of country, and he proposes to utilize the exposition as a means of instructing the seed growers in this region in the most approved methods adopted in Europe as the result of many years of experimenting.</p>
                            <p>Prof. Taylor is also in correspondence with the makers of beet sugar machinery, with a view of having a model plant in full operation on the exposition grounds in connection with the exhibit of seed growers.  He states that he has no doubt but that a complete plant will be established on the grounds and be in full operation during the season when beets are obtainable.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Woman's Board Discusses Educational Exhibits for Exposition.</head>
                            <p>The Woman's Board of Managers of the exposition has concluded its labors and adjourned to meet again in September.  Yesterday afternoon's session was devoted entirely to the discussion of the plan for educational exhibits which was drafted by the executive committee.  The plan covered the classification in all branches of school work, this portion of the plan covering four sheets of paper closely typewritten.  It also included the conditions to govern the individual preliminary contest designed to secure the best grade of work for the exposition.  This is the competition to be held before the exposition opens and is entirely independent of the exposition itself.</p>
                            <p>The classification of school work to make individual and collective exhibits at the exposition covered every branch of school work from the lowest grade to the post graduate course of colleges and universities.  Competitors in these classes were graded according to the nature of the work, the idea being, as President Sawyer expressed it, "to prevent a child in the first grade from competing with a college student."  Suitable prizes were provided for in each class and the conditions of entry were prescribed.  These details were very voluminous and will be published in pamphlet form in the near future and will be distributed in every school district in the transmississippi region.</p>
                            <p>The only other business transacted was the adoption of a resolution, empowering the executive committee to decide upon what auxiliary committees will be required to carry on the work of the board, and to appoint such committees.  This was accomplished after considerable discussion, the general opinion being that the work could be done more expeditiously with one head than under the direction of the whole board.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Formulate Plans for Establishing Themselves on the Grounds.</head>
                            <p>The committee appointed at the meeting of representatives of the local German societies last night to take the preliminary steps toward the organization of a German village or resort at the exposition met this morning and made a thorough canvass of the situation, which resulted in a very definite idea as to the general features of the project.  The committee has applied to the Department of Concessions for two acres of ground, which will be entirely devoted to the purpose.</p>
                            <p>The idea of making a complete German village was abandoned as impracticable, but the space will be converted into a resort which will present all the attractions of the popular summer gardens of the Fatherland.  A commodious pavilion will occupy a part of the ground.  The first story will be occupied by the restaurant and cafe and the second floor will be a large hall devoted to the uses of the various German societies.  The center of the hall will be ornamented with a handsome fountain and a German military band will discourse music every day.  The surrounding grounds will be attractively set out with shrubs and trees, with numerous pretty arbors.  Bowling alleys will be among the attractions and another will be a cafe where the fair sex can supply themselves with tea, coffee, cakes and other light refreshments.  This is the general plan of the resort as now determined on, but it is expected that various other valuable features will be added as the enterprise develops.  The committee will probably recommend the organization of a stock company to carry out the scheme and another general meeting will he held at Turner hall next Friday night.</p>

                            <p>The subscriptions on exposition stock are being paid in very slowly, but the amount is gradually approaching the $200,000 mark, which must be reached before the state appropriation of $100,000 is available.  The report of the secretary made to the executive committee yesterday showed that the total cash receipts up to July 1 were $118,293.40.</p>
                            <p>Up to this time subscribers have been slow to respond to the appeal of the executive committee to pay their subscriptions in full in order to increase the total to the desired amount.  Half a dozen holders of one, two or three shares have responded promptly, but few of the larger subscribers have taken advantage of the offer of 5 per cent rebate for full payment.  Aside from the Burlington railway, the only other subscribers of more than $100 who have paid in full are Dan Farrell, jr., who made a full payment of his subscription of $1,000, and the Nebraska Fuel company, which paid in its full subscription of $750.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Exposition Executive Committee Meetings to Be Private.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition held a session yesterday, which lasted all the afternoon.  The early part of the meeting was conducted along the same lines which have been followed since the inception of the exposition, the meeting being open and the newspaper representatives being admitted.  Later this method was changed and it was determined that representatives of the newspapers should hereafter be excluded from the sessions of the executive committee, and only such matter allowed to be made public as might be deemed best by the committee.  This action was the result of numerous private conferences which have been held lately by some of the members of the committee, at which this course was determined upon.  All the members of the committees were present except Managers Rosewater and Hitchcock.</p>
                            <p>Before the doors were closed it was decided that no effort would be made by the committee to force the calling of a special election to vote $100,000 in bonds by the county of Douglas in aid of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Manager Babcock reported the result of his conference with the officials of the Missouri Pacific regarding the laying of construction tracks on either side of the main court of the exposition grounds.  Mr. Babcock was particular to emphasize the fact that there is nothing in the arrangement with the Missouri which will in any way prevent any other road from laying its tracks on the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Buildings and Grounds was directed to prepare plans for a dairy building, although the construction of this building will not be pushed immediately.</p>

                            <p>The Transmississippi Troopers held their regular weekly meeting at the Commercial club rooms last night and completed the organization of the remaining companies of the brigade.</p>
                            <p>The committee appointed at the last meeting to recommend officers for the remaining companies made its report, recommending that the following men be elected as officers of troop B: Robert W. Patrick to be captain, W. W. Umsted to be first lieutenant, and Will G. Doane to be second lieutenant.</p>
                            <p>The committee recommended that troop C be assigned to South Omaha, the Equestrian club of that city having agreed to organize at least one troop of the troopers from among their members.  This troop will be charged with the duty of electing its own officers.</p>
                            <p>For troop D the committee recommended H. J. Penfold as captain, the other officers to be elected later.  For troop E the committee reported that George F. Bidwell, general manager of the Elkhorn railway, had agreed to accept the position and organize a full troop from among the railroad men of the city.</p>
                            <p>The entire report was then adopted as read, no objections being made to it.  It was stated that the captain of each company would be expected to recruit his company to the full maximum limit and that each of the officers recommended by the committee had agreed to this in advance.</p>
                            <p>The United States army cavalry drill regulations in current use were adopted as the standard to be followed by the troopers in all movements.</p>
                            <p>It was decided that the members of the troopers would participate in a body in the parade at South Omaha next Monday.  The uniforms have not arrived and it was regarded as doubtful if they would be received in time for the parade, but it was decided that the members would meet at Hanscom park pavilion at 10 o'clock Monday morning, mounted, and proceed in a body to South Omaha, leaving the park promptly at the hour named.</p>
                            <p>The following committee was appointed to see that every member of the organization is on hand to take part in the parade: Dudley Smith, chairman; E. M. Bartlett, D. Farrell, jr., W. W. Umsted, H. T. Lemist, F. B. Millar, W. H. Thomas, G. W. Sues, J. H. Hussie, James Paxton, R. W. Patrick, J. G. McGuckin.</p>
                            <p>Captain Thomas issued an order for the members of troop A to report for duty at Hanscom park at 10 o'clock Monday morning.</p>

                            <p>Peter Penner presided and Otto Kinder was made secretary.  Then the subject of the meeting was discussed at length.  There was a lively difference of opinion among those present as to the methods which should be adopted to execute the scheme.  Some of them wanted the arrangements placed in the hands of the general organization which was formed some time ago for the purpose of working up an annual "German Day" celebration, while others wanted an entirely new organization formed.</p>
                            <p>The debate continued for over three hours and it was finally decided that the new organization should be formed, but not without a walkout by the leaders of the disgruntled minority, Philip Anders, Pete Schwenck, George Anthes and a few others.</p>
                            <p>The following committee was appointed to arrange the plan in all details: R. Engleman, E. F. Schurig, F. Martin, Joseph Guth, H. Schunke, Henry Strasshofer, Charles Epplen, Carl Ruhrmohr, P. Schwenck, William Meyer, Charles Breier.</p>
                            <p>The next meeting will occur on next Friday at Turner hall.  The committee on arrangements will meet at the same place on Tuesday night.  At the latter meeting a report will be received from a subcommittee consisting of R. Engleman and E. F.

In this way it is hoped to have all the main buildings well under way before fall and the construction of the smaller buildings will then be pushed in the same vigorous manner.</p>
                            <p>The office of the architects-in-chief presents a very busy scene during these warm days.  A large force of draughtsmen is busily engaged in working out the details of construction, following a uniform scheme in the erection of the framework of the several buildings.  The drawings are duplicated by the hectograph process, the ordinary method of making blue prints being entirely too slow owing to the large number of copies of each drawing required.</p>

                            <head type="sub">STAFF HANDLED LIKE BOARDS.</head>
                            <p>There is a general impression that the construction of staff buildings can only be carried on during warm weather and that the first frost will bring the work to a complete standstill.  Architect-in-Chief Kimball says this is a mistaken notion.  He says these buildings can be erected in any kind of weather without any more drawbacks than would obtain in the erection of a building covered with boards.  Mr. Kimball says staff is a mixture of plaster of paris, some kind of hemp fibre, and, usually, a small quantity of cement.  This substance is molded in large <choice><sic>slabe</sic><corr>slabs</corr></choice> and after it is dried is handled in the same way as a board of the same size, being fastened in place with nails.  The casting of these slabs is the operation which requires warmth to successfully complete, but after the work is once completely dried the weather has little effect upon it during the first year, although it is not permanent for a longer time.</p>
                            <p>When the erection of the main buildings commences the contractors will establish their "staff plants" on the exposition grounds for the manufacture of these slabs.  It has been decided that the buildings shall be given the tint of old marble and the staff turned out of these factories will be colored to produce this effect.  These "slabs" will be on an immense scale and many of them will be works of art in themselves.  Intricate carving and classic sculpture will be imitated to a nicety and the artistic effect produced by the finished buildings will be such as could only be found otherwise in the most beautiful buildings of the old masters.  Statuary of heroic size will surmount some of the main buildings and these will all be done in staff.  The imposing columns of the long colonnades and of the beautiful porticos facing the main court will be constructed of the same lowly material.  The handsome bas relief sculpture adorning the pediments of the main buildings will be moulded of staff and the lions couchant and rampant surveying the main court from their lofty pedestals will be poured out of a huge pot and not won from the bowels of mother earth by the hand of the sculptor.</p>

                            <p>The conditions precedent to a participation by the Board of Park Commissioners in the work of improving the exposition grounds have at last been complied with and within a few days the necessary papers will have passed giving the city the title to the eleven acres of land which will be known hereafter as Kountze park.  When this is done the park board will at once begin active work, co-operating with the exposition management.  The board will expend about $30,000 this year in beautifying the grounds and will expend an additional amount next year.  This eleven acres forms the center of the Kountze tract of forty acres.  Half of the eleven acres was donated to the city by Mr. Kountze, and the other half was purchased by the exposition association and presented to the city for park purposes.</p>
                            <p>Dudley Smith of this city has been appointed by the exposition management as commissioner general to Great Britain and will start for Washington Wednesday of this week, accompanied by Mrs. Smith.  In Washington Mr. Smith will be supplied by the Department of State with credentials to the British government, and his principal endeavor will be to induce that government to appoint a commissioner to the Transmississippi Exposition and make a government exhibit.  If this is done it is expected that a very salutary effect will be produced upon English manufacturers and a much larger number of exhibitors thereby secured from that country.  Mr. Smith will be absent until some time in September.</p>
                            <p>The laying of railway tracks into the exposition grounds will be commenced this week and by the time the contractor for the Administration building is ready for his material the tracks will be ready for use in setting his cars just where he wants them.  These tracks will run along the north and south sides of the main court at the rear of the main <choice><sic>bulidings</sic><corr>buildings</corr></choice>, and will be used for hauling in material to be used in the construction of the buildings and, later, for hauling exhibits directly to the buildings in which they are installed.</p>

                            <p>These particular tracks are to be laid by the Missouri Pacific and will connect with the Belt Line tracks near the junction with Sherman avenue.  They will cross Sixteenth street at right angles with the street and will pass along the bluff tract.  Other tracks will probably be laid on the grounds by the Northwestern company, whose tracks are about as near to the exposition grounds as those of the Missouri Pacific.  The Missouri Pacific will make a switching charge of $4 per car for all cars placed on the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>The artesian well contractor has been having considerable difficulty during the past week or ten days in recovering his drill and grappling tools which were lost at the bottom of the well, a distance of over 700 feet below the surface.  The drill was lost first and shortly afterward the grappling tools were likewise lost while attempting to get hold of the drill.  The accident caused by too much haste.  The supply of pipe with which the well is lined as fast as the hole is pushed toward the center of the earth, became exhausted.  Not wishing to lose time by waiting until another supply of pipe was received, the contractor continued drilling without lining the hole.  As a result the drill became fastened at the bottom of the hole and the rope used to operate it was broken.  A grappling tool was sent down the hole to recover the drill, but the earth tumbled into the hole and the grappling tool was held fast.  About this time more pipe was received and work was resumed in the regular manner, pushing the lining down to where the tools were fast.  The tools have been recovered, but the drill is still in the hole.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Lowest Bidders on the Construction of the Administration Building of the Exposition&#8212;Staff Work Goes to Chicago Firm.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee of the Transmississippi Exposition met at the Commercial club at noon today to consider the bids which had been received for the construction of the Administration building.  There were eight of these bids, two being for the building complete, two on the staff work only, and the other four for the carpenter work, which constitutes almost the entire work.  The two bids for the building complete were by Omaha men, Hamilton Bros. offering to do the work for $10,500, and a bid submitted by Albert Miller and George H. King covering the same, for $9,290.</p>
                            <p>The two bids on staff work were by Chicago men, Smith &amp; Eastman offering to do the work for $2,800.  Leopold Bonet submitted a bid at $3,200.</p>
                            <p>On the carpentry work the bids were as follows:  Barnett &amp; Records company of Minneapolis, $7,500; Bassett &amp; Percival, Omaha, $7,483; Briggs &amp; Cushman, Omaha, $5,900; R. C. Strehlow, Omaha, $6,375.</p>
                            <p>It is proposed to place the Administration building on a piling foundation and bidders were instructed to bid on the work with or without the piling, and in consequence they allowed offsets for the piling in case it is done by the exposition authorities.  As the latter course will be adopted, the cost of construction will be proportionately reduced.  Briggs &amp; Cushman were the lowest bidders on the carpenter work, their bid being $5,713, with the deduction on account of piling.  Smith &amp; Eastman of Chicago were the lowest bidders on the staff work, the total cost of the building, under these two bids, being $8,513.  The Department of Buildings and Grounds was authorized to enter into a contract with these two bidders for the work.  Construction will be commenced as soon as the contractors for the carpenter work can get their material on the grounds.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the Transmississippi Exposition held its regular meeting at the Commercial club rooms yesterday afternoon.  All of the members of the committee were present except Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and the entire afternoon was spent in revising the rules for the guidance of the several departments of the exposition management.  This work was only partially completed when the adjournment was taken.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall reported that five bids had been received for the construction of the Administration building, but the figures were not announced, the tabulation of the bids not having been completed.  A special meeting will be held within a few days to pass upon these bids.</p>
                            <p>The creation of a bureau of admissions has formed the subject of considerable discussion among the members of the committee and the matter was disposed of by creating the bureau to be in charge of three members of the executive committee, Messrs. Lindsey, Bruce and Kirkendall, with Mr. Lindsey as chairman, the bureau to be under the direction of the ways and means department.</p>
                            <p>The concession for a Moorish village was let to E. A. Felder, who agreed as a part of his contract to expend $25,000 on the buildings and decorations of the concession, making a genuine Turkish village even to the harem of the chief, which will be peopled by Turkish beauties imported for the occasion.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Exhibits of the Transmississippi Exposition continues to receive applications for space for exhibits of all kinds.  In this morning's mail were a number of applications, among them being the following: Charles F. Brown, a mineralogist of Hot Springs, Ark., asked for space for exhibiting a mineral collection which he said was valued at $50,000.  L. Prang &amp; Co. of Boston applied for space for an exhibit of chromos and etchings.  The Phillips Sanitary Grate company asked for 250 square feet for an exhibit showing an improved fire grate.  R. H. Browne applied for space in the Electrical building for exhibiting an electrical device.  J. G. Benster &amp; Co. of Moline, Ill., applied for the privilege of making an exhibit of windmills near the irrigation grounds.</p>

                            <p>There was rejoicing about the exposition headquarters this morning over the information that the artesian well contractor had recovered his drill and other tools lost at the bottom of the 700-foot hole three weeks ago.  The tools were recovered this morning and the work of drilling was at once resumed.  The losing of these tools caused very serious delay in sinking the well, but it is expected that a flowing stream of water will be struck within the next 100 feet.</p>

                            <p>The work of securing the $200,000 of cash payments on exposition stock is progressing in the most encouraging manner and the goal is almost reached.  The state appropriation of $100,000, which was voted by the last legislature, will not be available until $200,000 in cash has been paid in by stock subscribers, although the law making the appropriation becomes effective tomorrow.  The exposition management has been making strong efforts to encourage subscribers to pay their subscriptions in full in order to bring the total up to $200,000 by the time the law takes effect and this effort has been very successful up to this time, the full amount of paid subscriptions at noon today being $153,280.  This result has been accomplished by means of printed requests, which have been mailed to each subscriber.  In addition to this, Manager Lindsey of the Ways and Means Department, accompanied by Director Herman Kountze, started out this morning with a paper to secure the signatures of some of the larger subscribers to an agreement to pay their subscriptions in full on or before July 10 in order to bring the total payments up to the desired amount.  The following signatures were obtained to this paper: Lee-Clarke Andreesen Hardware company, A. Millard, estate of Ezra Millard, C. W. Lyman, Commercial National bank, J. L. Brandeis &amp; Sons, Nebraska Clothing company, J. A. Creighton, J. M. Woolworth, W. A. Paxton.</p>
                            <p>A roll of honor has been started at the exposition headquarters, containing the names of those subscribers who have paid their subscriptions in full in order to help make the state appropriation available.  These subscribers will receive handsomely engraved stock certificates, testifying that they have paid their stock in full, as soon as the blank certificates are received from the printer.  Those who have paid in advance in full, up to noon today, are, the figures indicating the amount of their subscriptions:</p>

                            <p>The appointment of an art director is a matter which will engage the attention of the exposition management very soon.  The control of the Art department has been placed in the hands of a committee of men who are members of the Western Art association, under the supervision of the executive committee of the exposition, and the selection of an art director has been the subject of considerable thought on the part of all concerned, as it is conceded that the character of the display will depend entirely upon the man selected as director.</p>
                            <p>The committee having the Art department in charge has recommended a well known artist to the executive committee for appointment, and applications for the position have been received from other sources.  The Department of Exhibits has received an application from A. H. Griffith, director of the art museum of Detroit, Mich., who offers to fill the position without pay.  Mr. Griffith is endorsed by a number of people who are well known as patrons of art, among them being Senator T. W. Palmer of Michigan, Hon. John W. Bookwalter of New York, Governor Bushnell of Ohio, D. M. Ferry of Detroit and George H. Barbour of Detroit, the latter having been a member of the jury of awards in the Art department at the World's fair.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DRAWINGS OF THE EXPOSITION BUILDINGS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Architects Crowding the Work that Bids for Construction May Be Invited at Earliest Possible Date.</head>
                            <p>The work of making the working drawings for the main buildings of the Transmississippi Exposition buildings is progressing rapidly, a large force of draughtsmen being employed night and day.  The plans for the Mines and Mining building will be completed about July 15.  The drawings for the Machinery building are in hand and will probably be completed by the last of the month.</p>
                            <p>The plans of Architect Cass Golbert for the Agricultural building were received from him today and will be placed in the hands of the draughtsmen at once.  All of the plans of the main buildings are now in the possession of the architects-in-chief and every effort is being made to complete the working drawings in order that contracts may be let as soon as possible.</p>
                            <p>The contract of Briggs &amp; Cushman, who were awarded the carpenter work on the Administration building is in the hands of the executive committee for approval and the contractor will be ready to commence work within two weeks.</p>
                            <p>The general public has expressed many misgivings as to the stability of the Administration building on account of its great height, as compared with the ground area.  The building is to be 150 feet in height and only fifty feet square on the ground.  Every assurance is given by the Department of Buildings and Grounds, however, that the building will be as stable as any permanent building of one story.  A method of anchoring will be used which is new in exposition architecture.  The foundation will be of piling.  Huge cottonwood logs will be of piling.  Huge cottonwood logs will be driven into the <choice><sic>gorund</sic><corr>ground</corr></choice> a distance of thirty or forty feet and the building will be securely anchored to these, making it very rigid, so that the danger of overturning will be reduced to the minimum.</p>
                            <p>These piles will be driven by the Department of Buildings and Grounds next week, so that as soon as the carpenter contractors get their material on the ground, the way will be clear for them to go ahead.</p>
                            <p>Smith &amp; Eastman, the Chicago firm which secured the award for the staff work on this building, will be in the city early next week to enter into a contract for the work.  They will undoubtedly establish a staff plant on the grounds for the manufacture of their material, and will thus have the advantage on future buildings.  This fact is regarded as a strong factor in favor of Omaha contractors having the inside track for securing the carpenter work on the other main buildings.</p>

                            <p>The contest was begun at the national convention which was held in Philadelphia a year ago, where an informal resolution endorsing Omaha was adopted.  This is subject, however, to the approval of the 1897 convention, which meets at Detroit, and to this end some arrangements must be made to offer the convention some inducements in the way of the entertainment of delegates.

                            <div3>
                            <p>At the regular monthly meeting of the Board of Directors of the Transmississippi Exposition held yesterday afternoon the plan of organization of the exposition management was changed and the Departments of Publicity and Promotion were consolidated under the management of Edward Rosewater, who has been in charge of the Department of Publicity since the organization of the exposition.  Manager Hitchcock, who had been in charge of the Department of Promotion, resigned his position as manager of that department and member of the executive committee, and the plan of organization was changed to reduce the executive committee to six, instead of seven members, giving President Wattles the right to cast the deciding vote in case of a tie in the committee.  Heretofore the president has had a voice but no vote in the proceedings of the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>There were thirty-two of the fifty directors present when the secretary finished reading the minutes of the last meeting.</p>
                            <p>Before any business had been transacted, Mr. Hitchcock called up his resignation, which had been offered at the last meeting and voted down.  He renewed his announcement that he had firmly determined to resign as a member of the executive committee and manager of the Department of Promotion, and moved that the resignation be accepted.  Mr. Wharton seconded the motion, and it was put to a vote and carried without a dissenting voice.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles then declared that the next business in order was the election of Mr. Hitchcock's successor.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Wharton said that at the last meeting Mr. Hitchcock had stated there was no further work for the Department of Promotion to do, and the speaker believed that it would be a wise policy to reduce expenses as much as possible.  He therefore moved that the Department of Promotion be consolidated with the Department of Publicity.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock admitted he had said that the work of the Department of Promotion was concluded, but he said he wished now to say that there was much to be done.  He said it rested with that department to carry out the collateral ideas in connection with the exposition, such as the mobilization of the militia, etc.  He said that the president of the exposition had been in close touch with the work of the Department of Promotion since the beginning, and he moved as an amendment that the president be elected as manager of that department, that the work might be continued by the man who had had it in charge and was familiar with it.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wharton replied, taking the position that the exposition was too large to be impeded in its onward course by any subordinate.  He opposed the idea of putting the president in charge of any department.  The president, he said, should be in constant touch with all the departments, and not tied down with the detail work of any of them.</p>
                            <p>Director Hussie wanted to know how much would be saved by consolidating the two departments.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock said no department of the exposition had been conducted so economically as that of promotion.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">WHERE ECONOMY EXISTS.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater said he had not intended to take any part in the discussion and did not intend to vote on the question of consolidating the two departments, but he said it was just as well for the members of the board to understand the situation.  He prefaced his explanation by saying that in no previous exposition had the Departments of Publicity and Promotion been separated, as the work was so closely related, but when the present exposition was organized the division was made because there was so much to be done both in the east and in the west.  At the last meeting of the executive committee which the speaker had attended Mr. Hitchcock said there was no longer any necessity for the Department of Promotion, and the speaker said he agreed with that statement.  Taking up the question of the relative expense of the two departments Mr. Rosewater said the reports of the secretary showed that the Department of Publicity had expended $4,600, while the Department of Promotion had expended $8,600.  He said these figures spoke for themselves.  Referring to the salaries paid the superintendents of the two departments Mr. Rosewater said the duties of the two positions were as different as could well be imagined.  The superintendent of the promotion department was not required to do anything but simple clerical work, according to the directions of the chief, while the superintendent of the publicity department was required to keep the exposition continually before the public and devise ways of keeping up the public interest.</p>
                            <p>General Manderson spoke at some length in favor of consolidating the two departments in the interest of economy.  He quoted the following figures from the report of the secretary showing the expenditures by departments up to this date:</p>

                            <p>Section 4. Executive Committee&#8212;The executive power and administrative authority of this association shall be placed in the hands of an executive committee of six directors, who, as such committee, shall have full general power and authority of the Board of Directors in all matters, except such as the Board of Directors shall by resolution specifically reserve to itself in advance of final action by the executive committee; provided, that in case of a tie in the committee the president shall have the right to cast the deciding vote.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wharton renewed his motion to consolidate the two departments and it was carried without a dissenting vote.</p>
                            <p>The matter of limiting the amount of expense which might be incurred by the executive committee was then broached by Mr. Lyman, who introduced a resolution providing that no contracts or expenditures shall, in the aggregate, exceed 75 per cent of the total of the stock subscriptions, donations and amounts due from concessions.</p>
                            <p>This resolution precipitated considerable discussion and it was finally referred to the executive committee with instructions to make a full report on the matter at the next meeting of the Board of Directors.</p>
                            <p>A resolution by General Manderson, instructing the secretary to furnish each director with a monthly report showing the names of employes and their salaries, was adopted and the board adjourned.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Executive Committee Considers Several Important Matters.</head>
                            <p>At the meeting of the executive committee of the exposition, held at the Commercial club rooms yesterday afternoon, the matter of appointing an art director was discussed briefly, the offer of Mr. Griffith, director of the Art museum of Detroit, Mich., to fill the position without pay being presented by Manager Bruce of the Department of Exhibits.  No action was taken on the application, the matter of selecting a director having been heretofore referred to the committee of the Western Art association.  During this discussion President Wattles made the proposal that he would be one of a party of Omaha men to raise a purse of $5,000 to purchase works of art after the exposition to encourage artists to make displays.  It was stated that the city of Atlanta appropriated $2,500 with which to purchase works of art as a means of inducing artists to send their works to the Atlanta exposition.</p>
                            <p>A letter from Commander Clarkson of the Grand Army of the Republic was presented by Manager Hitchcock.  The letter was in reference to a proposed union of the blue and gray or a monster meeting of the soldiers of the northern and southern armies.  The writer said the project was a most laudable one and would be supported by him if properly started by the exposition authorities.  It was suggested that several attempts had been made heretofore on several occasions to bring about the same result, but without success, and the writer expressed the opinion that considerable generalship would have to be displayed in order to make the movement a success.</p>
                            <p>A letter was received from George E. Collins, the colored delegate from this state to the convention of the National League of Republican Clubs, calling attention to the fact that a movement has been started among the colored delegates to the league meeting to make the question of discrimination against colored people in hotels and other public places an issue in selecting the next place of meeting of the national organization.  The writer asked the exposition management to agree in writing that it "would do all in its power" to prevent such discrimination in case Omaha was selected.  The request will be complied with.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Ford of the Women's board submitted a communication quoting a letter received from Homer Moore, reviewing the proceedings of the National Music Teachers' association and the failure to secure the next meeting for Omaha, and suggesting that certain things be done by Mr. Moore in the way of arranging for a musical congress, etc.  The letter was referred to President Wattles with a request that he inform Mr. Moore that the exposition is not ready to take the matter up at this time.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Allowing Rebate to Those Who Pay on Stock.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition held a special meeting at noon today.  The time within which a rebate of 5 per cent will be allowed subscribers to exposition stock who pay their subscription in full was extended ten days.  This action was deemed advisable for the reason that it has been found that the managers for many of the large subscribers have found it necessary to consult with the directors of their concerns before paying their subscriptions in full, and the time limit placed on the offer of a rebate was found to be too short.  This rebate applies only to the 35 per cent of the subscription which, under the rules of the exposition, is not assessable until 1898, and does not apply to that portion of the subscription until the remaining 65 per cent has been paid in full.</p>
                            <p>The contract and bond of Briggs &amp; Cushman for the carpenter work on the Administration building was approved by the committee.</p>
                            <p>The matter of selecting an art director was brought up by Manager Bruce, who reported that he had received a letter from Mr. Griffiths, the directors of the Detroit Art museum, in which he stated that he should ask for a salary of $4,000 to cover the entire period of the exposition, together with allowance for expenses.  This was somewhat in the nature of a surprise to the members of the committee, in view of the fact that it had been understood that Mr. Griffith had offered his services without salary.  A general discussion was had on the question of entering into a contract with either Mr. Griffith or the man who had been recommended by the committee of the Western Art association, there being little difference in the matter of the expense.  It was finally decided that no action should be taken for the present, and the committee will endeavor to follow the example of Nashville by finding some patriotic citizen who is posted in art matters to offer his services without cost to the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Building and Loan Associations Will Work Together.</head>
                            <p>At the Commercial club last night about twenty representatives of the various building and loan associations of Omaha and South Omaha met and decided to act as a unit in securing the 1898 national convention of building and loan associations and in entertaining the delegates if the convention was secured.  T. F. Godfrey was made chairman of the meeting and T. J. Fitzgerald of South Omaha secretary.</p>
                            <p>D. H. Christie and G. M. Nattinger briefly explained the character of entertainment that had been provided for previous conventions, and it was the general opinion that motor rides to Council Bluffs and South Omaha, with a banquet, together with adequate accommodations for the sessions of the convention, would be all that would be expected.  Mr. Christie stated that while the convention last year declared a preference for Omaha, there would undoubtedly be a contest at Detroit this year, and it was desirable that the Nebraska delegates should be assured that if they obtained the next convention for Omaha all the associations would co-operate in the task of entertaining it.</p>
                            <p>In accordance with this suggestion, A. P. Tukey moved that it be declared the sense of the meeting that the convention should be secured and that all associations should stand by the enterprise.  This was carried by a unanimous vote, and it was also ordered that the president of each of the local associations should designate one member of a general committee on entertainment in case the convention was secured.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, July 9.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;H. Sling, Hip Lung and Sam Latt, Chinese merchants from Chicago, have been here several days trying to secure permission from the Treasury department to import 500 Chinese laborers to be employed at the Omaha exposition.  H. Sling and his partners have secured concessions for a theater and joss house at the exposition and claim that the buildings can only be erected by Chinese.  The department is disposed to grant the request, but the laborers will be admitted under greater restrictions than have ever been imposed before.  They will also be kept under espionage while in this country, and will be compelled to leave the United States at the expiration of three months.  Permission was given last January for the admission of 500 Chinese laborers to be employed on the Nashville exposition, and they were to remain six months.  The time has about expired and it is now discovered that less than sixty Chinamen can be found on the exposition grounds.  The others have doubtless engaged in the laundry business in the various cities of the country.  Before granting the request of H. Sling and has associates the secretary of the treasury directed them to submit it in writing and they agreed to do this.  They started on the return trip to Chicago tonight and will forward a written proposition within the next few days.</p>

                            <p>LINCOLN, July 9.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;A number of the state exposition directors were in the city today, being under the impression that they would receive their commissions and be able to hold a business meeting.  They have been notified by the governor that the commissions will be issued Monday and they are called to hold a meeting on Tuesday.  The governor has not yet decided what course to pursue in regard to the appointment of Martin Dunham.  It is reported today that Mr. Dunham will probably resign, but no communication to that effect has been received from him.  Should another appointment be made in place of Mr. Dunham, it is probable that T. F. Sturgis of Omaha will be chosen, although C. A. Whitford of Arlington and John Martin of South Omaha are strongly recommended.  Mr. Sturgis is a silver republican, Mr. Whitford a populist and Mr. Martin a democrat.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The trip of the Transmississippi Troopers to South Omaha to participate in the Fourth of July celebration of the Magic City last Monday promises to dispel entirely the somewhat strained relations which have heretofore existed between the semi-public bodies of the two cities.  The feeling of good fellowship which was manifested on both sides before the day was over was strong evidence that the visit of the troopers was most opportune.</p>
                            <p>An invitation from the South Omaha Equestrian club asking the troopers to take part in the parade in South Omaha was the occasion of the trip to the packing center of the west.  Hanscom park was selected as the rendezvous, and when the start was made from there at 10 o'clock Monday there was a most satisfactory number of troops in line, with Major Dudley Smith in command.  The uniforms of the troopers were not received in time for the parade, but each man wore white riding trousers and a dark coat and hat, and all along the line of march they were greeted with cheers and flattering remarks.</p>
                            <p>After the parade was over Major Smith requested Captain Lott of the South Omaha Equestrian club and Captain Foye of the Thurston Rifles to have their companies follow the lead of the troopers.  This was done and the line was halted beneath the spreading trees in Syndicate park, where the order to dismount was given.  When the horses had been picketed and arms stacked the weary men were lead to another part of the park, where elaborate preparations had been made for their reception.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">PETER ILER'S FORESIGHT.</head>
                            <p>Peter Iler of the troopers, who had been in the parade with the rest of the party, had anticipated the wants of those who had ridden for hours in the hot sun, and an Omaha caterer, under Mr. Iler's instructions, had prepared a cold lunch under the trees.  A long table, covered with a snowy cloth, was laden with sandwiches, pickles, olives, cakes and various other things calculated to tickle the palate of a hungry man.  Lemonade was furnished as a lubricant and after the lunch was over the neatly uniformed waiters rolled several huge ice cream freezers from a cool nook.  Some of the part made wry faces over the idea of eating ice cream, but when the covers were removed, revealing a large number of "cool bottles" of extra pale, packed in ice, these expressions vanished.</p>
                            <p>After the contents of the freezers had been sampled there was impromptu speaking, Mr. Iler made a few remarks in honor of the occasion, and Major E. M. Bartlett made a short speech, which was received with cheers and manifestations of approval on the part of the South Omaha people.  Major Smith followed with a few remarks in the same strain, expressing the friendship and unity of interest which exists between the residents of Omaha and South Omaha, and then Captain Lott and W. B. Cheek and other members of the South Omaha Equestrian club made short talks, in which they voiced the sentiments of their organization.  It had been arranged that the Equestrian club would organize one troop of troopers and uniform the men in the style adopted by the organization, but it was stated by the speakers that the sentiment aroused by the appearance of the troopers in the parade would undoubtedly result in two or more troops being organized in the Magic City.</p>
                            <p>Then everybody cheered for everybody else and the little affair was over.  The friendly feeling engendered by this gathering under the cool shade of Syndicate park was strongly in evidence, and Peter Iler was voted the prince of good fellows for his thoughtfulness in providing for the wants of the tired and thirsty troopers.</p>

                            very well in Chicago.  They are merchants and dealers, and among the most intelligent of their race.  They say that they are very anxious to obtain permission for 400 of their countrymen to be at the exposition for three months next year.  I told them that I would be glad to help them in any legitimate way; that probably their wish would be accomplished, but that we could only be friends so long as they kept strictly within the law.  When they violated it we would thenceforth be enemies.  Chinese have a wonderfully strong desire to come to this country and chances of this kind are sometimes availed of to get here permanently.  You remember that the Chinese colony at the Nashville exposition slipped away one night, left the grounds and obtained their freedom.  If these 400 Celestials reach Omaha the temptation will be very strong for them, too, but I do not believe they will get away from the exposition people.  Chinese use all kinds of dare devil devices to obtain admission to this country, risking their lives and liberty, seemingly with no care for the consequences.  A case came to my notice a few days ago when some Chinese from British Columbia secreted themselves in the hold of a vessel and had several tons of coal placed over them.  They were discovered, however."</p>

                            <head type="main">MUSIC.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>When it was known to be sure that the Music Teachers' National association would be holding its next meeting in New York the question arose, "What can we have in the place of it?" and the answer to that question has been found in a possibly National Congress of Musicians.  The nature and work of such a congress was discussed with a number of the leading musicians in New York at the time and their heavy co-operation was promised.  It was believed by them that a much more representative gathering could be obtained than was embraced in the membership of the Music Teachers' National association, since a large number of very prominent musicians had never been its members, or taken part in its work.  These men have not approved of its methods and have deplored the fact that anybody could become a member if he could afford to spend $3, that musicianship had nothing to do with it.  As a congress of musicians would be necessity embrace in its active force only those of acknowledged ability and would class all others as "associates," there could rise no objection from these musicians on that score.</p>
                            <p>Since the close of the convention the writer has spent some time planning the details for such a congress.  As it now appears he would recommend that it continue five days, that the day sessions be held in some suitable hall in the city, that the evening concerts be held in an immense music hall to be situated on the exposition grounds.  The financial details under which this plan could be carried out do not need to be discussed here.  The order of exercises could be as follows:  9:30 a. m., paper or discourse;  10:15 a. m., paper or discourse; 11 a. m., recital; 1:30 p. m., paper or discourse; 2:15 p. m., paper or discourse; 3 p. m., recital; 4 p. m., discussion; 8:15 p. m., grand concert.</p>
                            <p>It is intended that the paper should be prepared by men and women who are especially conversant with the subjects to which they are assigned, bringing to it a specialist's skill.  For instance, Dr. Hanchett of New York would be able to produce a remarkable essay upon "The Soul in Beethoven's Music," and W. L. Tomlins of Chicago possesses some original and valuable ideas concerning "Music as a Factor in the Development of the Individuality of a Child."  Mr. Thomas, editor of the American Art Journal of New York, could present a world of information upon "The Development of Americanism in Music."  In the program outlined above there would be room for twenty essays, and a great variety of subjects could be chosen.  At the close of the congress these essays should be carefully arranged and published at the twenty chapters of a book which would surely be valuable to every person interested in music.</p>
                            <p>It should be the central idea of the recital and concert programs to produce American compositions, and when performed by the orchestra it should be stipulated that the composer should be present to conduct his own work.  These programs could be so varied in their makeup as to appeal to and attract the great mass of the people who do not care for "classical music," and who would have no interest in the essays.  In this way the exposition could make money for its music fund and have the benefit of the great names of composers and conductors.  The essays would be of interest to those who have studied music somewhat and desire to broaden and increase their knowledge.  Furthermore, the whole would be upon such a plane and be of such personal advantage to the great educators, performers and composers of this country that their co-operation could be depended upon.</p>
                            <p>The great musicians of the country have differed in their regard for the Music Teachers National association, but all have been anxious for the welfare of American music.  In a recent letter to the writer Mr. George W. Chadwick says,  "I have no special connection with the Music Teachers' National association, but will be glad to do anything I can in your interests should the occasion occur."  Mr. Chadwick composed an important work for the opening of the World's fair at Chicago, and perhaps could be prevailed upon to write something for the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
                            <p>The music of the exposition should, as a general thing, be of a nature to appeal and entertain the masses, but at times it should occupy the plane of high art and interest and attract the cultured.  Such a congress as is herein outlined would certainly do this, and, if the work of its preparation were begun immediately large delegations from nearly all the states in the union could be expected, and the hearty co-operation of the leading musicians enlisted; but this must be done before these people form other alliances and become interested in other matters.</p>

                            <p>Anton Seidl has been conducting in London, and the papers credit him with being the greatest of Wagner conductors.  He is now at Bayreuth directing the great festival, the yearly <choice><sic>occurence</sic><corr>occurrence</corr></choice> of which has made the little Bavarian village a Mecca to musicians from all parts of the world.  This country should have some such <choice><sic>musicial</sic><corr>musical</corr></choice> center to which the teachers could go for new inspiration and for such information as would keep them abreast of the times.  A summer resort and a music school united to a series of opera and concert performances would accomplish a vast deal for the up-building of American music and the education of the American musician.  It might be possible for Omaha to present these advantages&#8212;excepting the opera&#8212;during the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EDUCATIONAL DISPLAY AT THE <choice><sic>EXPOSITIO</sic><corr>EXPOSITION</corr></choice></head>
                            <head type="sub">Woman's Board of Managers of the Exposition Completes the Details for Securing an Excellent Exhibit.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The Woman's Board of Managers of the Transmississippi Exposition, having in charge the educational exhibits of the exposition, has prepared a plan for securing a large and representative collection showing the conditions prevailing in the educational system of the country.  In addition to making preparation for the exhibits to be made at the exposition the board has adopted a plan by which the character of this display shall be raised to a high standard and made to illustrate the best work of which the students of the competing region are capable.  In this plan it is provided that a preliminary contest shall be held under the direction of the woman's board, and the successful competitors at this contest shall be honored by having their exhibits placed in the exposition in space to be provided by the board.  A competitor in this preliminary contest, however, is not debarred from entering his exhibit in the exposition, provided he pays for the necessary space therefor.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the prizes for single exhibits offered by the exposition management the woman's board has made up an additional premium list for collective exhibits made by schools or colleges.  Under this list premiums in the form of pennants are offered as follows: One special pennant for the best state exhibit, ten pennants for the ten best county exhibits, ten pennants for the best exhibit in each of thirty-two classes.  These classes are as follows: Under group 1 are the graded schools, including kindergartens and all intervening grades up to and including colleges and universities; group 2 includes schools for the education of the defective classes, such as schools for the deaf and dumb, blind, feeble minded and schools of correction and charities; group 3 includes technical schools, including technological, industrial and manual training institutions, business colleges and examples of Sloyd work; group 4 covers special schools, such as Indian schools and parochial  schools; in group 5 are art schools, covering exhibits of drawing, modeling, wood carving, etc.; group 6 covers exhibits of music, including those from both public and private schools; group 7 includes miscellaneous schools, libraries, chautauqua work, women's clubs and exhibits showing child study.</p>

                            <head type="sub">TEMPTING PREMIUMS.</head>
                            <p>The exposition authorities offer a tempting list of premiums for individual exhibitors in the form of diplomas.  A jury of awards will be selected for each class of exhibits and the awards will consist of a special diploma for a silver medal, a diploma for a bronze medal and a diploma of honorable mention.  Every diploma calling for a medal will be accompanied by an official medal of bronze prepared by act of congress at the United States mint.</p>
                            <p>It is in the individual competition, however, that the woman's board has made its work most prominent.  This is the preliminary contest, designed to encourage the pupils of all organized schools, whether public or private, to exert themselves to the utmost.  A large number of prizes are offered in this contest, and the additional incentive is offered that all work winning prizes is to be placed in the exposition without any additional expense to the exhibitor.</p>
                            <p>In order to enter this competition every exhibitor must first secure from Secretary Frances M. Ford of the Woman's Board of Managers of the exposition a certificate which costs 25 cents.  The next requirement is that the competitor must be an enrolled student in some organized school.  All work must be done by the competitor, but there is nothing to debar any competitor from competing for as many prizes as he sees fit if he comes within the age limit fixed for the several classes, but he must have a separate certificate for each entry.  These certificates will have blanks for the name and address of the competitor, and the name of his instructor, and they must accompany each exhibit.  All exhibits must be in the hands of Secretary Ford, at exposition headquarters, Paxton block, Omaha, by April 15, 1898.  Prizes will be awarded as soon as possible after that date, and all exhibits winning prizes will be placed in the exposition.  Exhibits not winning prizes will be held subject to the order of the owner.</p>

                            <head type="sub">VALUABLE TO EDUCATORS.</head>
                            <p>In making up the premium lists for this individual competition the members of the woman's board have consulted with some of the most prominent educators in the country and the object has been to spur the pupils on to their highest efforts.  Prominent educators have already expressed the opinion that the material produced in this competition will be very valuable, and several of them have announced their determination <choice><sic>do</sic><corr>to</corr></choice> secure much of it for their work, so that in addition to winning the prize offered by the woman's board there is a strong probability that much of this material will bring a good price from many of the most prominent educational institutions in the country.  A glance at some of the divisions of the premium list will show the basis for this belief on the part of the educators referred to.</p>
                            <p>Medals of gold, silver and bronze are offered as prizes in this competition.  One gold, two silver, and four bronze medals will be awarded to each class competing under each division of each subject.  For the purposes of this competition all competitors will be divided into six classes.  Class 1 will include all children under 6 years of age; class 2 will include those between 6 and 9 years of age; class 3 those between 9 and 12 years; class 4 those from 12 to 15 years of age; class 5 those 15 years of age who are not in universities or colleges, and class 6 those from universities and colleges.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Description of the Mines and Mining Building.</head>
                            <p>The perspective drawing of the Mines and Mining building of the Transmississippi Exposition has been received by the Department of Promotion and Publicity from Architect John J. Humphreys of Denver, who designed the building.  The drawing shows a handsome building, designed along rigid classic lines, of the Doric order, modified to comport with nineteenth century requirements.  The result is a building of simple dignity, and having an air of repose which in considered requisite in a large building.</p>
                            <p>The facade represents a frontage of 400 feet accentuated at center and ends with pavilions, sixty-four and forty feet respectively, thereby obtaining sufficient variety of mass.  The solidity of these pavilions and their strong perpendicular lines and shadows will give a strong contrast of light and shade.</p>
                            <p>The height of the building to the top of the main cornice is forty feet; the height of order thirty feet, resting on stylobate ten feet high.  The height of the center pavilion to the top of the crowning group of statuary is eighty-five feet, while the end of the pavilion is sixty-five feet to the top of the dome.</p>
                            <p>The lighting of the building will be obtained by large windows, ten feet wide by twenty-four feet high, placed at intervals of sixteen feet, and the roof will have a large skylight area, making the interior very bright and cheerful.</p>
                            <p>The center entrance of twenty-four feet wide by thirty-four feet high, and will be very rich in decoration, flanked on either side by coupled columns and their accompanying pilasters, standing six feet from the walls.  The main cornice breaks around a projection of columns supporting pedestals for groups of statuary twelve feet high.  The center of the pavilion is crowned by a colossal group of statuary.  There will also be single statues between columns resting on stylobate, which will be projected out to receive them.  The spandrils above the arch will be decorated with bas-reliefs.  The end pavilions with their entrances will be crowned with shallow domes.</p>
                            <p>The implements emblematic of mining are so few that, with the exception of a few trophies, the entire exterior elaboration will be confined to classic ornaments, and reserve for the wall spaces of the large center vestibule, which is twenty-four feet wide and sixty feet long, such elaboration.</p>
                            <p>The ceiling will be a large barrel vault,<unclear reason="cut off"/></p>

                            <p>CHICAGO, July 11.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Factions in the Chinese colony in South Clark street are engaged in a bitter dispute over the representation at the Transmississippi Exposition.  Wong Chin Foo, president of the Chinese Equal Rights league and editor of the Chicago Chinese News, has been appointed commissioner and purposes importing a number of skilled workmen from the Celestial empire.  Hip Lung, Hong Sling and Lem Let have been allowed have been private concessions by the directors of the exposition and are following the plans suggested by their prominent countrymen.  Wong Chin Foo alleges that his rivals are prompted in their undertaking by a desire to dispose of the imported Chinamen at a high price and smuggle laundrymen into the country.  Both factions have representatives in Washington, who expect to secure an audience with Secretary Gage.  So bitter is the feeling of each side that a personal encounter between partisans of the leaders is expected at any time by the police.</p>

                            <head type="sub">BACK FROM THE EDUCATIONAL MEETING</head>
                            <head type="sub">Superintendent Pearse and Secretary Gilland Tell of the Work Required to Secure Next Year's Convention of the Educators.</head>
                            <p>Superintendent Pearse of the Omaha schools and Secretary Gillan of the Board of Education returned this morning from Milwaukee, where they attended the annual convention of the National Educational association.  They also succeeded in winning for Omaha the preliminary skirmish for the location of the 1898 convention, and now all that is necessary is that the citizens of Omaha shall succeed as well with the executive committee when it visits the city to investigate the resources of the city in the way of accommodation and entertainment.</p>
                            <p>Both gentlemen are much elated on account of their victory, which was won against overwhelming odds.  It was an uphill battle from the start and they met a well organized and vigorous opposition from Washington, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, which were the principal opponents.  How close the fight was is evident from the fact that on the final vote in the committee Omaha received 10 votes; Washington, 9; Salt Lake, 8, and Los Angeles 7 votes.</p>
                            <p>Having won in the convention, both Superintendent Pearse and Secretary Gillan are confident that the expectations of the committee can be satisfactorily met.  The committee will probably visit Omaha in September, and at that time the members must be satisfied as to the ability of the city to provide adequate accommodations for the convention.  The only possible objection that is anticipated as serious is to the location of the Coliseum, which is the only auditorium in the city that is adequate for the purposes of the convention.  If the building was located downtown they would regard the convention as already secured, but it is possible that some members of the committee may have some objection to offer on this point.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition held a short special session at the Commercial club rooms at noon today.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion, and President Wattles were appointed a committee to see that the interests of the exposition were properly represented at the meeting of the Transmississippi Commercial congress, to be held in Salt Lake City this week.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater suggested that today is the eightieth anniversary of the birth of ex-Governor Alvin Saunders, vice president of the exposition, and upon motion of Mr. Bruce, Mr. Rosewater was appointed a committee to draw up suitable resolutions, expressing the congratulations of the exposition management to the veteran who has spent half a century in the public service.</p>
                            <p>Manager Reed of the Department of Concessions announced that an erroneous impression seems to prevail among the people that the exposition management was guilty of extravagance in sending commercial agents abroad to visit foreign countries in the interest of the exposition.  Mr. Reed wished to call the attention of the public to the fact that in every case where commercial agents or commissioners have been appointed it has been under conditions which required them to bear  their own expenses, the only arrangement by which they could draw any pay whatever being an agreement by which they received a commission on the money for exhibit space received by the exposition through their efforts.  Mr. Reed said the rate of commission paid to these men was very low, being much below that paid by any former exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Rival Leaders Contest for Exposition Privileges.</head>
                            <p>According to some of the Chicago newspapers, there promises to be a lively contest between the opposing factions of the Chinese in that city over the Chinese concession at the Transmississippi Exposition.  The leaders of the two factions which seem to exist among the Mongolians of Chicago were competitors for the Chinese concession and each side made a fight for the privilege of exploiting the sights and scenes of the flowery kingdom.  Wong Chin Foo, editor of the Chinese News and president of the Chinese Equal Rights league of the United States, was one of the applicants and Hong Sling, the immigrant agent for several railroads, was his opponent.  Both sides exerted every effort to land the prize and Hong Sling was successful.  The Department of Exhibits then made overtures Wong Chin Foo and he was appointed commissioner of the Chinese section.</p>
                            <p>It seems that the fight between these two factions was not ended by this termination of the first encounter, and each side seems determined to impede the other as much as possible.  Wong Chin has organized a company to be known as the North China Trading and Manufacturing company and says he will apply to the Treasury department at Washington for permission to import 300 of his countrymen from north China, representing all branches of manufacture and of the skilled arts of China.  The Chinese exhibit in charge of Foo will be in the Manufactures building.</p>
                            <p>The concession secured by Hong Sling will be on the Plaisance and will comprise a Chinese theater, farm, bazaar and joss house.  Sling has also formed a company and has applied to the Treasury department for permission to import 500 Chinamen for the purpose of operating the concession.</p>
                            <p>Wong Chin Foo charges that Sling's sole purpose is to import a lot of coolies, men and women of the lowest social grade, and sell them as slaves after they have served his purpose at the exposition.  Foo says that he wants to show that the people of north China are not objectionable as citizens, and he will endeavor to prevent his opponent from importing "coolies."</p>

                            <p>The artesian well on the exposition grounds is rapidly nearing the center of the earth, a depth of 800 feet having been reached yesterday afternoon.  The drill is going down at the rate of about fifty feet per day.  All of yesterday the drill was in limestone rock.  Contractor Nebergall says he expects he will have to go to 1,000 feet before striking a good flow of water.</p>

                            <p>The following associations will be formally invited to hold their annual meetings of next year in Omaha be the Commercial club this week:  American Pharmaceutical association, National League of Republican Clubs American Association of Agricultural Colleges and Experimental Stations, Building and Loan National association, and the Photographers' Association of America.  This was the report made to the Commercial club's executive committee this afternoon by Commissioner Utt, and it was decided to go right after the five conventions mentioned in lively style.  It was also resolved to at once begin making plans for the entertainment of the executive committee of the National Educational association when it visits Omaha in September to inspect the facilities of the city for the big convention of school teachers next summer.</p>
                            <p>Messrs. Poppleton, Hospe and Utt were appointed a committee to wait on the Indian teachers with a view of securing the national meeting in 1898.</p>
                            <p>The meeting adjourned for two weeks, unless a special meeting should be made imperative before that time.</p>

                            <p>This is not a subscription to the stock of the exposition, but is a donation to the enterprise, and the money will be paid in at once.  This is the full amount of the subscription asked for by the exposition management, without any discount for full payment at this time, which is being allowed all stockholders who pay up in full.  The donation is considered very liberal, as the Rock Island has only one line through the city, and has neither a terminal point nor a division here.</p>
                            <p>The Rock Island is the fourth road to make its subscription to the exposition, leaving the Missouri Pacific, the Union Pacific and the Wabash yet to be heard from.</p>
                            <p>The payment of this $20,000 makes the total amount paid in to date $190,000, or just $10,000 short of the amount necessary to make the state appropriation available.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>D. R. Smith, jr., assistant commissioner for the Chinese section in the Manufactures department, is in the city in consultation with the Department of Exhibits regarding the exhibits of methods of Chinese manufacturing to be made under the direction of Wong Chin Foo, the Chinese commissioner.  The functions of the Chinese commissioner are entirely distinct from those of the concessionaire of the Chinese village.  The latter will be on the Plaisance and will consist of a bazar, joss house, Chinese farm, restaurant theater, etc.  The exhibits to be secured by the Chinese commissioner will be under the jurisdiction of the Department of Exhibits and will comprise sections in which will be shown Chinese artisans at work at their several vocations, making the many articles of a useful and ornamental nature for which the skillful workmen of the northern part of China are noted.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith is an American, but he has traveled extensively in all parts of China and is thoroughly familiar with the language and customs of the <choice><sic>counry</sic><corr>country</corr></choice>.  He promises that the Chinese section shall eclipse anything ever before attempted in that line.  He says this will be accomplished through the aid of the North China Trading and Manufacturing company, a powerful company including within its membership many of the wealthiest and most influential merchants of North China who are interested in pushing their wares before the American public.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Concessions of the exposition has received an application for a concession for space and the right to operate the smallest railroad in the world.</p>
                            <p>Accompanying the application is a photograph showing a train of cars consisting of an engine, tender, four flat cars, or "gondolas," a box car and a caboose.  The train is in motion, the steam is blowing from the safety valve and the whistle is sounding for a crossing.  The engineer is kneeling in the flat car just back of the engine tender operating the tiny engine, and in each of the other flat cars are seated two boys, their feet doubled under them and evidently enjoying themselves hugely.  One boy is perched on top of the box car and another is on the caboose.</p>
                            <p>The dimensions of the engine are given as follows:  Weight of the engine alone, 300 pounds; length of engine and tender, six feet, seven and one-half inches; diameter of drive wheels, eight inches; diameter of cylinders one and one-half by two and one-half inches; water supply, eleven and one-half gallons; diameter of boiler, eight inches; water space in boiler, twenty-seven inches long; ten one-inch flues, each nineteen inches in length.  This miniature train is guaranteed by its exhibitor to make fifteen miles per hour.</p>
                            <p>The application for space for this train is made by R. Norris of Denver.</p>

                            <p>A. Monsnier of Brussels, whose letter head shows him to be an "exposition agent," writes the Department of Exhibits for information regarding the exposition for the benefit of his customers.</p>
                            <p>Charles A. Goss, an attorney who resided in Omaha until recently, writes from Cleveland, O., that he is now connected with the Standard Lighting company of that city and makes application for space for an exhibit by that company.</p>
                            <p>A novel application comes from a man named Firman of Philadelphia, who wants space in which to exhibit a machine for making hot roast beef sandwiches.  He states that he does not want a concession to sell the sandwiches, but merely to exhibit his machine with a view of finding a market for others like it.</p>
                            <p>T. P. Cartwright, commissioner for the shoe and leather section of the Department of Exhibits, reports that the St. Louis Shoe and Leather club has decided to make an exhibit at the exposition.  Mr. Cartwright also states that he secured five applications for space in Cincinnati, and will go from there to Buffalo, New York and Chicago on the business of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Fred Schmohl, a concessionaire at the Nashville exposition, has made application to the Department of Concessions for the privilege of erecting an old southern plantation.  He states that if he is granted this concession he will erect on the top of one of the cabins a figure of a negro sixty-five feet in height, so constructed that he will move his eyes and play on a banjo, singing loud enough to be heard over an area of five acres.  He wants 2,000 square feet of space.</p>
                            <p>A. E. Tice, the proprietor of an entertainment called "The Devil's Dance," now being exhibited at Coney Island, asks for a concession to operate his attraction at the exposition.  He gives a "bill board" description of his show, which seems to indicate that it is largely an electrical device showing some wonderful antics played by the subtle fluid at the command of his satanic majesty in order to terrify two coy maidens who have been enticed into his cave in a huge mountain.</p>

                            <p>Fish Commissioner Brice today said to The Bee that it was absolutely essential that the various bureaus to be represented at the Omaha exposition should name their representatives at once, and the president should name the president of the board, in order that the scope of the work might be decided upon.  He said he would like to know definitely the extent of his exhibit in order that he might utilize considerable of the Nashville exhibit.  He was emphatic in saying that the government building should be completed not later than February, so that the exhibits now at Nashville might be removed to Omaha without necessitating packing and shipping to Washington, a distance of 750 miles, and the out to Omaha.  It would be food policy to complete the government building long before the exposition opened, as his experience at Nashville was not of a character to warrant undertaking a government fish exhibit unless space was at his disposal for that purpose.  He said it was his desire and intention to even excel the Atlanta exposition exhibit, which he regarded as the finest the commission ever made.</p>

These headquarters, the judge said, would be in charge of the assistant secretary of the commission, who had not yet been selected.  There are several candidates for the position among them being Senator Dearing of Plattsmouth, George Furnas of Brownsville, C. H.

More than the required amount has been promised before July 20.

                            <p>The actual work of erecting the city which is to house the great Transmississippi and International Exposition has commenced.  The pile foundation for the Administration building is being put in and will be completed by tomorrow night.  Briggs &amp; Cushman, the contractors for the framework of this building have their material on the ground, and their workshop and is now being erected.  They will be ready to begin the active work on the building as soon as the foundation is completed.</p>
                            <p>The Administration building will be completed within four months from this date.  While the building could be constructed in less than two months if there were need for doing so, the contractors have been given plenty of time, as there is no necessity for haste.  The carpenter contractors are given three months to complete their portion of the work and the staff contractors are given thirty days to put the staff in place.</p>
                            <p>To facilitate work the fence around the Kountze tract has been entirely closed, a section of the fence having been constructed across Twentieth street just south of Manderson.  This part of the grounds will be kept closed to all except those having business therein in order to prevent delay.  The other portions of the exposition grounds will be left open until it becomes necessary to close them on account of the work.</p>
                            <p>The next contract to be let will be for the Manufactures and Liberal Arts building.  Bids for this were to have been opened today, but protests were received from contractors that the time was too short for them to prepare their bids, and the time was consequently extended for five days, and bids for the construction of this building will be opened at 4 p. m., July 20.</p>

                            <head type="sub">In Addition to the Well, Pumps Will Be Used.</head>
                            <p>The artesian well on the exposition ground is going down toward the bowels of the earth at a rapid rate.  A depth of 900 feet has been reached and no delay has ensued since the tools were recovered last week.  It is anticipated that a heavy flow of water will be struck within the next 100 feet.</p>
                            <p>An erroneous impression seems to prevail regarding what is to be expected of this well.  Rumor about town has it that the water supply of the exposition depends upon this hole in the ground.  Nothing could be further from the fact.  While the well will be of immense benefit in the way of a water supply, and while other wells will probably be sunk in the event that a good flow is secured in the first one, yet there are other resources which will be called upon in supplying the immense quantities of water which will be required.</p>
                            <p>It is estimated that for the lagoon alone there will be about 1,000,000 gallons of water required every day.  No well could be expected to supply this quantity of water, and the well now being sunk will not be called upon for any such impressive feat.  Preparations are being made for two other means of supply.  Both contemplate pumping water from the Missouri river.  By one plan it is proposed to construct a line of pipes from the river to the east end of the lagoon and pump the water be means of centrifugal pumps into the lagoon, allowing it to flow out gradually through the sewer at the west end of the main court.  Another plan is to pump the water from the east end of Cut Off lake and pump it from the west end into pipes which will carry it to the east end of the lagoon.  Whether this plan will be agreed to by the property owners along Cut Off lake has not yet been determined.  If they object the water will be taken from the river.  The pumps and other machinery necessary to carry these plans into effect have been offered to the exposition management free, as exhibits, and either plan will entail but little expense.</p>
                            <p>For fire protection to protect the buildings of the exposition, the water company's system will be called upon.  The artesian well will be utilized for display purposes and for drinking water, and for supplying the buildings if the quantity is sufficient.</p>

                            <p>The success of the Nebraska delegation in landing the 1898 meeting of the National League of Republican Clubs was the subject of general discussion on the streets today as soon as it became known that the recommendation of the committee on location, endorsing Omaha, had been adopted by the convention.  All reports coming from Detroit were to the effect that excellent work had been done by the delegation and the members of the delegation were highly commended on all sides for the diplomacy displayed.</p>
                            <p>The comments on the result of the meeting of the national league in Omaha were along just two lines.  One was purely political and the other was concerning the effect upon the exposition.  It was conceded that, as a political move, the meeting will be most effective and its effect will be far-reaching throughout this entire section.  As to the effect upon the exposition, it was agreed that the meeting will bring to this city thousands of visitors from all over the country, men who will patronize the exposition and advertise it extensively upon their return to their homes.</p>
                            <p>Among republicans, especially, the feeling of rejoicing was most noticeable, but citizens without regard to party affiliations expressed the greatest gratification that the long list of national conventions had been increased by the addition of a gathering so large as the national league.</p>

                            <p>Another important convention has been added to the already long list of national bodies which will make Omaha their meeting place for 1898.  The American Association of Agricultural Colleges and Experimental Stations is the last gathering to fix upon Omaha as its meeting place for next year.  This association is now in session in Minneapolis, and the place for the next meeting

                            was selected this morning.  Superintendent F. W. Taylor of the Department of Exhibits of the exposition is in attendance at the meeting, and it was largely through his efforts, assisted by the other Nebraska delegates, that Omaha was decided upon.</p>
                            <p>The attendance at the meeting of this body is in the neighborhood of 100, all of the delegates being professional men, many of them being accompanied by their wives and families.  The sessions continue several days.</p>

                            <p>Another huge convention which is in a fair way to hold its 1898 meeting in Omaha is the Epworth league, now in session in Toronto.  The claims of Omaha and the many advantages offered by this city as a convention location for 1898 are being ably presented to the meeting of the league, and the contest for the choice has narrowed down to Omaha and Seattle.  The cabinet of the league, at a meeting held yesterday, decided that the convention should be held next year at one of these two cities.  Both are making a hard fight for the prize.</p>
                            <p>The meeting of the Epworth league brings with it about 12,000 or 15,000 delegates and visitors.  The convention continues in session several days.</p>

They stated that the reports in the Chicago papers regarding the trouble between them had been grossly exaggerated and had little foundation in fact.  That there had been a slight difficulty they did not deny, but they agreed in saying that nothing serious had existed, and even this had been removed and they would not conflict in the future.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith stated that the functions of the Chinese commissioner and the concessionaire of the Chinese commissioner and the concessionaire of the Chinese village were so entirely different that there was really no occasion for any disagreement.  He said an understanding had been reached which would obviate all future difficulty.  Both men left for the east this morning.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DETROIT, Mich., July 15.&#8212;Omaha was selected for the next convention of the Republican National league.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>DETROIT, July 15.&#8212;There was lots of talk among the national republican league delegates this morning about a coming departure from the program of Crawford for president, Dowling for secretary and Omaha for the next meeting place.  Maryland men wanted the convention to decline to ratify the action of the committee on time and place and select Baltimore as the convention city, thus giving the east a show for league benefits along with the west.  As to the secretaryship, the Michigan delegates had started an active boom for Fred J. Blakely of Detroit, and the men from Illinois were still in the field with Ora E. Chapin of Chicago for secretary and Chicago for the convention.</p>
                            <p>Before the convention was called to order the committee on credentials were obliged to hold a meeting to consider questions of proxies and changes made in the personnel of the delegates from New York and from Illinois, caused, it was asserted, by the absence of some of the delegates.</p>
                            <p>The new president, Mr. Crawford, called the convention to order at 11 o'clock.  A motion was passed directing that copies of the plank in the platform urging the passage of a discriminating duty act for the protection of American shipping in the foreign trade be sent to the president, vice president and members of congress.  A resolution of thanks for and appreciation of the efficient services of Mr. Woodmansee as president was adopted unanimously.  The citizens of Detroit were thanked for their bountiful entertainment.</p>
                            <p>The list of vice presidents was then read as follows:  Pennsylvania, Mahlon D. Young; Oregon, H. M. Cake; Nebraska, W. P. McCreary; Iowa, John S. McQuiston; Indiana, J. W. Egnew; Virginia, Samuel Burroughs; West Virginia, Stuart Reed; Illinois, W. A. Rodenberg; Alabama, Charles Henley; New Jersey, Thomas McEwan; New York, John W. Totten; Ohio, W. E. Sefton; Tennessee, F. L. Case; Texas, J. E. Lutz; Vermont, H. S. Peck; Wyoming, F. E. Warren; Louisiana, W. S. Hero; Missouri, John L. Gleason; Maryland, J. C. Friedel; Massachusetts, W. M. Crane; Michigan, A. F. Peake; Kansas, K. H. Hook; Kentucky, W. M. Donaldson; Minnesota, R. E. Thompson; Colorado, Benjamin F. Kimberly; Utah, Dennis C. Eichnon; Georgia, J. F. Hanson; Arkansas, M. A. Elliott; Oklahoma, C. M. Barnes; California, L. G. Brow; New Mexico, Max Frost; South Dakota, W. G. Porter; College league, J. B. Whitney, Illinois.</p>

                            <p>When nominations for secretary were called for, Mr. Payne came forward and presented the name of Ora E. Chapin of Chicago in a vigorous and somewhat sensational speech.  He characterized his candidate as a man earnest, active, capable, pure in heart and purpose, and for McKinley from the beginning; upholding the administration not in a half-hearted way, but earnest and straightforward.  "Chicago is not asking for the convention next year, and the Chicago delegation is not asking for it, but there are some men here, paid emissaries, who want to make some money out of it.  John R. Tanner cannot place me under the lash; he can remain if he will the arch-enemy of the McKinley administration, but he can't lash me into line."</p>
                            <p>Melville W. Hayes of Ohio nominated Fred J. Blakely of Michigan in a glowing speech.  Ohio, he said, had never swung its electoral vote in behalf of democracy.  He would present a man worthy and capable, who had no enemies, always an indefatigable worker for the league.  His manhood, he said, spoke for itself, and the ability was of the highest.</p>
                            <p>E. S. Reese of Minnesota presented the name of Michael J. Dowling for secretary.  He predicted that the battle royal in the politics of the country was coming within the next two years and the league must have a man in charge of the details of its organization who was tried and true and experienced.  Minnesota was considered doubtful in the last campaign, but on election day it showed 54,000 plurality for McKinley.  The position of Minnesota was that of Michigan's guest, but Michigan ought not to bring a candidate against the present faithful efficient secretary.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">DOWLING WINS EASILY.</head>
                            <p>Missouri seconded Dowling's nomination.  Mississippi endorsed the nomination of Dowling, and President Dingley of Michigan surprised the convention by declaring that Michigan had no candidate for secretary, indicating dissatisfaction in the state delegation at the candidacy of Blakely.  "Michigan wants to do what is right, and it therefore seconds the nomination of Michael J. Dowling," concluded Mr. Dingley.  Arkansas was the next state to come to the front with an emphatic endorsement of Dowling.  President Copley of Illinois said that in behalf of 90 per cent of the Illinois delegation he refused to be lashed into line for Chapin by 10 per cent.  He supported Dowling.  Then there was a scramble on the part of delegates to secure recognition to second the nomination of the present secretary.  Wisconsin, New York, North Carolina, Vermont and Pennsylvania flocked to the Dowling standard in rapid succession, and the college league and Commercial Travelers' league added their voices to his support.  Many calls were heard for his election by acclamation, but the regular order was demanded and the roll call proceeded with.  Michigan was disposed at first to announce a divided vote, but later got together on Dowling.  Ohio, from whence the nomination of Blakely had come, then changed from Blakely to Dowling.  The vote resulted:  Dowling 1,289; Chapin, 360&#8532;; Blakely, 38&#8532;.</p>
                            <p>It was made unanimous for Dowling.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Dowling thanked the delegates for his re-election and promised as good work under President Crawford as had been done under President Woodmansee.  He expressed his determination to shape the destinies of the league according to his best ability, regardless of the criticism of those who may not like his methods.  Three cheers for Dowling followed.</p>
                            <p>President Crawford called Marcus Pollasky to the chair during the election of a treasurer.</p>
                            <p>Congressman McEwan of New Jersey named Frank J. Higgins of that state and the sentiment of the convention was so evidently unanimous for him that the rules were suspended and Mr. Higgins elected by acclamation.</p>

                            <p>The report of the committee on time and place of the next convention was submitted by the chairman, Governor Barnes of Oklahoma.  He announced that Omaha had been selected by unanimous vote, with one exception.  The committee recommended that the date be left to the new national executive committee.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Boyd of Maryland made a minority report in favor of Baltimore, signed by Boyd and by Steinberg of New York.  Michigan seconded the substitution of Baltimore for Omaha, and Mr. Boyd continued his argument, asserting that the Marylanders had actually done more real fighting and sacrificing for republicanism than any state in the union, until finally the formerly ostracised republicans became successful, and did so through the work of the Maryland Republican League clubs.  He closed by eloquently describing Baltimore's charms and varied conveniences, including the city's good eating and beautiful women.</p>
                            <p>A minority report in favor of Chicago was submitted by George Bird of Illinois and others.</p>
                            <p>General Willard Warner of Tennessee moved that the question of time and place be referred to the executive committee for determination, but it was not seconded.</p>
                            <p>C. J. Greene of Omaha spoke fervidly in support of the majority report.  He said populism has run riot in Nebraska and if the convention would come to Omaha it would do much to win the state back.</p>
                            <p>D. H. Atwell of Texas presented the claims of the city of Dallas, as the only republican city in Texas.  He said the Texas newspapers had never printed any extended Associated Press reports of republican league gatherings, and the only way to get the proceedings before the people of his state would be to hold the next convention in Dallas.</p>
                            <p>State Senator Hamilton of Chicago said his delegation would be happy to see the next convention in Chicago, but the conventions should be so controlled that out of them should come the "sinews of war."  He moved that the whole subject be referred to the executive committee for determination for the reason that the committee could canvass the situation and decide best for the league financially and otherwise.</p>
                            <p>Delegate Hayes of Toledo, a member of the executive committee, declared that he had rather exercise his prerogative as a delegate on the floor in settling this question than to act upon it in the committee.</p>
                            <p>After further discussion, during which three-quarters of the delegates were on their feet, a motion to table the motion to refer the question of convention place to the executive committee prevailed, against a chorus of protests from Illinois, reinforced by many other delegates.</p>

                            <p>The question then recurred on the substitution of Baltimore for Omaha, but after a deal of confusion a substitute for the whole matter was adopted, under which the roll of states was called and the delegates voted for the cities of their choice respectively.</p>
                            <p>The result of the ballot sustained the majority report and gave the convention to Omaha.  On the roll call Baltimore and Chicago each received substantial support, but before the announcement of the vote the states were clamoring for a chance to swing into line for Omaha.  A motion that the secretary cast the entire vote of the convention for the Nebraska city prevailed.</p>

                            <p>The Maryland men angrily demanded the announcement of the result of the ballot.  The secretary announced the vote as follows:  Dallas, 75; Chicago, 188; Baltimore, 240; Omaha, 1,097.  Then, on motion of Marcus Pollasky and in the midst of a scene of wild disorder, the convention adjourned.  During the closing fifteen minutes nearly everybody present crowded excitedly about the platform and it was the general verdict that the convention of '97 will be conspicuously remembered for its lack of order.</p>

                            <p>Another exposition building is about ready for inviting bids for construction, and full plans and working drawings will be turned over to the Department of Buildings and Grounds early next week.  This is the Auditorium building.</p>
                            <p>The drawings for the Auditorium, which are made by Fisher &amp; Lawrie of this city, show a building which will be an artistic addition to the other beautiful buildings on the main court of the exposition.  It will stand on the south side of the Kountze tract, just west of the Arch of the States and will occupy a space 136x246 feet.  There will be two principal entrances, one on the east and the other on the north side, facing the lagoon.</p>
                            <p>The exterior of the building presents the appearance of two stories surmounted by a high balustrade, back of which appears another story.  The whole design shows a very studied treatment along classic lines of their Corinthian order of architecture, liberally embellished with ornamentation drawn from the inexhaustible resources of the French renaissance.  The first story is of ashlar work, with arched openings, while the second story is treated with columns on the principal facades, back of which appear open loggias, twenty feet in depth.  The balustrade surmounting the second story guards an open promenade twenty feet wide, back of which rises a "clear story" liberally treated with Corinthian columns.  At each corner of the building is a square pavilion rising above the main lines of the structure.</p>
                            <p>Statuary is freely used on the exterior of the building, designed along lines which convey at once to the eye the general character of the building and the use to which it is devoted.  At each corner of the pavilions are life-size figures representing music, dancing, etc.  A large pediment on the east facade contains an allegorical group depicting the muses.  Surmounting this pediment is a statue of heroic size representing Fame.</p>
                            <p>The interior of the Auditorium is arranged on the lines of a Greek theater, with the seats in a semi-circle, facing the south.  The main floor has a seating capacity of 4,000 and the stage 500.  Opening from the auditorium and arranged around the sides are from twelve to fifteen large rooms, each about twenty feet square, which may be used for committee rooms, dressing rooms for theatrical people, etc.</p>
                            <p>The interior is most artistic, being treated along the same lines as the exterior, with the free use of ornamental columns, but no massive columns appear to break the view of the audience from any point.  The immense roof of the structure is supported entirely by trusses, involving intricate engineering problems.</p>
                            <p>Especial attention has been paid by the architects to the problem of acoustics, and they express the belief that the building will be entirely satisfactory on that point.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Congress of All Agricultural Societies at the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>A congress of all organizations whose work is essentially agricultural is one of the things which the Department of Publicity and Promotion of the Transmississippi Exposition is working to bring about.  It is estimated that there are in the United States fully fifty societies of a national character whose work is connected more or less directly with the farm, and fully four times that number of state organizations which are working full harmony with the national societies, but along entirely different lines.  Each of these societies is organized independently of the others and issues its own literature, holds its meetings regardless of the others and develops specialists of a high order along the lines which gave birth to the society.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Publicity and Promotion believes that this form of organization, while of inestimable value in each branch, results in narrowing the views of the members of each, and that from continual obligation to his particular association the individual loses sympathy with his fellow agriculturists in other branches.  It is expected that this effect will be counteracted by the proposed congress.</p>
                            <p>The plans for this gathering have not been completed, but the general proposition is to secure the participation and presence of the principal representatives of all state boards of agriculture, stock breeders' associations, horticulturists, dairymen and all other branches of the vast army engaged, under whatsoever heading or division, in agricultural work.  With this end in view, letters are being sent out to the representative men and officers of these various societies, asking their views and co-operation in formulating a plan for such a congress, with the suggestion that the meetings cover a period of at least two weeks.  It is argued that the exposition presents the best opportunity ever offered for carrying out this long cherished scheme of prominent educators, as the Transmississippi Exposition will be the greatest exposition along agricultural lines ever seen in the United States.  It is suggested by the department that an advisory board be formed to arrange a plan for the congress and the persons addressed are asked to express their opinion on this suggestion.</p>

                            <p>George M. Mischke, western agent for the Department of Exhibits of the Transmississippi Exposition, writes to the department that the state of Colorado will be represented at the exposition in a most creditable manner, notwithstanding the fact that the legislature failed to make any appropriation for that purpose.  He reports that the people of the state are wide awake to the many advantages offered by the exposition as a means of bringing their state to the attention of the world.  He says that great preparations are being made to exploit their conception of the resources of the Centennial state.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Schute, secretary of the State Board of Horticulture, has assured Mr. Mischke that the society is making the most elaborate preparations to exploit the horticultural resources of the state and will have an exhibit of Colorado fruit which will make southern California look well to its laurels.</p>
                            <p>The commercial interests of the state, according to Mr. Mischke, are thoroughly aroused, while the mining interests are losing no time in making preparations to show to the world the mineral resources of the state.  He states that the selection of the architect of the Mines building from among the architects of Denver has aroused a great interest in having the state properly represented and an organization to carry this into effect has already been perfected among the principal mine owners.</p>
                            <p>The adjutant general of Colorado is said by Mr. Mischke to be imbued with the magnitude and importance of the mobilization of the militia which is proposed in connection with the exposition, and has promised that the entire national guard of Colorado shall be in attendance at the encampment.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Some of the Attractions of the Great Southern Exposition&#8212;The Western States Taking Advantage, While New England is Neglectful&#8212;Substantial Basis for Business Prosperity in Tennessee.</head>
                            <p>NASHVILLE, TENN., July 7.&#8212;In accord with my promise to give you a report of my trip to the Tennessee Centennial, I beg to state that I found everything in a flourishing condition.  To begin with, the natural topography of the park renders it wonderfully beautiful and particularly adapted to purposes of the centennial.  The best effects by highest architectural talent are obtained, and next to the buildings the great feature of beauty is the landscape gardening.</p>
                            <p>The grounds are beautifully laid out, decorated with beautiful beds of flowers, foliage plants and a pretty lake.  On the lake are gondolas, manned by gondoliers, all direct importations from Venice.  The Parthenon is a most perfect art gallery, and the display of pictures is said by competent judges to be one of the most magnificent ever gotten together.  Next to the Parthenon in point of wonder and attractiveness is the Agricultural building.</p>
                            <p>The display in the Agricultural building is simply marvelous.  The government makes a good display.  All of the Southern and many of the Western states are well represented, some by special buildings.  The Western states that have taken an especial interest are Ohio, Indiana and Illinois.  The people from these states are pouring into Nashville and, joined by people of the South, have made the exposition a grand success.  You know the exposition opened May 1 and will continue until November 1.</p>
                            <p>Up to the 1st of July the average expenses were $1650 per day, and the average receipts are a little less than $2400 per day.  You will thus see, even from a financial standpoint, the exposition is a success.  This is more than the most sanguine friends anticipated.  One feature I particularly desire to call attention to is the fact that there is no extortion at Nashville connected with the exposition.  The prices at the hotels are the same as before the beginning of the centennial.  There is ample provision for the biggest crowds.  The largest attendance at the exposition was:  Negro day, 21,000; McKinley day, 30,300; Confederate day, 33,500.  It is estimated that at least 75,000 people were in Nashville during these busiest days, and they were all housed and fed with apparent comfort.  You know Nashville is a city of schools, and all of the large school buildings have been turned into temporary hotels.  The Vanderbilt University, with its forty acres of park, is now a vast boarding house.  It is a most delightful place, and is truly a Mecca of rest for the visitors to the centennial exposition.</p>
                            <p>I very much regret that New England has taken so little interest in the Tennessee Centennial.  It is a great field and a great opportunity for the cultivation of the South and her growing interests.  The West seems to thoroughly appreciate this fact, and is taking advantage of it.  September 23 is Massachusetts day, and I sincerely trust there will at least be a large visitation from New England to the centennial on that date.</p>
                            <p>My trip covered a large portion of Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky and Ohio.  It is my pleasure to report great activity in business circles, and the indications all point to a most bounteous harvest.  The wheat crop is saved.  It is fully 25 per cent greater than a year ago, and the farmers are getting 10 to 15 cents per bushel more for their wheat this year than they received for their last crop.  Potatoes are in great abundance, and command good prices.  The prospect for corn and cotton was never better.</p>
                            <p>On the whole I found that farmers and merchants are feeling wonderfully encouraged.  Everybody seems to look for a good business, and taking the crop prospects as a groundwork, their hopes certainly seem well based.  The Southwest, i. e., the great middle country, is a most remarkable and fruitful country.  New England cannot afford to lose any opportunity for the cultivation of the Southwest.  I trust you will do all in your power to bring to the attention of the good people of New England the opportunity which the Tennessee Centennial offers for gaining a knowledge of the Southwest.</p>
                            <p>The railroads south of the Potomac and Ohio rivers, and east of the Mississippi river have made remarkably low rates to the Tennessee Centennial.  The Western roads are fairly generous, but the roads north and east of the Ohio and Potomac rivers are treating the centennial badly.</p>
                            <signed>Yours very truly, <lb/> C. P. GAITHER.</signed>

                            <p>The premium list of the individual competition instituted by the Lady Board of Managers of the exposition makes an imposing appearance and hold out inducements sufficient to stir the most reticent child to exert himself to the utmost to win one or more of the prizes offered to successful competitors.  School work, for the purposes of this competition, is divided into many classes and in each class there are offered a variety of subjects from which to choose.  One gold, two silver and four bronze medals are offered in each class, and there is also the incentive in an agreement that the prize winners shall be given place in the exposition proper.</p>
                            <p>The object of this individual competition, as stated heretofore, is to secure the highest grade of work for exhibition purposes in the exposition, and it is requisite that all work intended for this competition shall be in the hands of Secretary Frances M. Ford, at exposition headquarters by April 15, 1898, accompanied by a certificate, properly filled out, the certificate costing 25 cents.</p>
                            <p>For the purposes of this competition all competitors, except those in manual training, are divided in six classes, as follows: Class 1, all children under 6 years of age; class 2, children between the ages of 6 and 9; class 3, those between 9 and 12 years; class 4, those between 12 and 15 years; class 5, those 15 years of age who are not in universities or colleges; class 6, those in universities or colleges.</p>
                            <p>In the manual training competition the classification of competitors follows the division by grades in use in the schools, division 1 including grades 5, 6, 7 and 8; division 2 being those in the first year in the manual training branch of the High school; division 3 those in the second year of the High school grade; division 4 those in the third year, and division 5 those in the fourth year of the High school course.  A finished piece of work is required in each class.</p>

                            <p>In the sewing competition there are two divisions, No. 1 covering collections of samples of hand work, darning, buttonholes, patching, hems, etc.  Division No. 2 requires a finished garment.  The first division is open to class 4 and the second to class 5.</p>
                            <p>The history competition promises to develop an immense mass of heretofore almost unknown facts regarding the early history of cities and towns, on the one hand, and on the other hand it will serve to stimulate a familiarity, on the part of competitors, with history and with current events.</p>
                            <p>The first subject is local history, and here competitors are given a choice of subjects for their papers.  These papers are required to be based on original material, or on personal investigation.  Competitors may choose either of the following three subjects: The state, the town or the county in which the competitor resides.  This competition is open to classes 3 and 4.</p>
                            <p>Subject 2 covers American history.  This is open to class 4, and two subjects are offered from which to choose.  The first is a supposed speech of George Washington at the opening of the Transmississippi Exposition.  For this paper the competitor will be required to follow Washington's ideas and style, and he must submit proofs, in the form of foot notes, referring to his writings, to justify all important statements.  The second subject proposed is this: "The Compromises of the Constitution in Relation to the Transmississippi County."  This paper must be based primarily on documentary proofs.</p>

                            <p>Subject 3 covers European history.  Two subjects are here offered from which to choose.  The first is a supposed correspondence between Gladstone and Bismarck, the provision being made that the paper must be in accord with their style of thinking and writing.  The second subject treats of "Russia as a Power in the World's Politics."  This competition is open to classes 4 and 5.</p>
                            <p>Subject 4 covers miscellaneous history and here five subjects are offered for papers.  The first is "The Diary of a Cuban Patriot;" the second, "Conversation Between and Armenian and a Cretan of the Nineteenth Century;" the third, "Comparison of the French Chamber of Deputies with the House of Representatives of the United States;" the fourth, "Comparison Between the Power, etc., of the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Speaker of the House of Representatives;" the fifth, "Comparison Between the Power of the President of the United States and the Emperor of Germany."  This competition is open to class 5.</p>
                            <p>Under subject 5 of the history competition is a puzzle in transmississippi history, open to all classes.  This puzzle will be ready for distribution by September 1, and will be sent upon application accompanied by a 2-cent stamp.</p>
                            <p>Nature study is another subject which is expected to develop many valuable contributions, and exhibits in this class bid fair to be in great demand after the competition is over.  There are seven subjects under this head and competitors are offered a choice under each subject.  The classification is as follows:</p>
                            <p>Subject 1&#8212;Local vegetable life:  a. Trees of your neighborhood; leaf.  b. Flowering plants of your neighborhood; leaf and blossom.  c.

                            <p>George M. Mischke, western agent for the Department of Exhibits of the Transmississippi Exposition, writes to the department that the state of Colorado will be represented at the exposition in a most creditable manner, notwithstanding the fact that the legislature failed to make an appropriation for that purpose.  He reports that the people of the state are wide awake to the many advantages offered by the exposition as a means of bringing their state to the attention of the world.  He says that great preparations are being made to exploit their conception of the resources of the Centennial state.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Schute, secretary of the State Board of Horticulture, has assured Mr. Mischke that the society is making the most elaborate preparations to exploit the horticultural resources of the state and will have an exhibit of Colorado fruit which will make southern California look well to its laurels.</p>
                            <p>The commercial interests of the state, according to Mr. Mischke, are thoroughly aroused, while the mining interests are losing no time in making preparations to show to the world the mineral resources of the state.  He states that the selection of the architect of the Mines building from among the architects of Denver has aroused a great interest in having the state properly represented and an organization to carry this into effect has already been perfected among the principal mine owners.</p>
                            <p>The adjutant general of Colorado is said by Mr. Mischke to be imbued with the magnitude and importance of the mobilization of the militia which is proposed in connection with the exposition, and has promised that the entire national guard of Colorado shall be in attendance at the encampment.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Tells How Omaha Managed to Capture a Convention.</head>
                            <p>President Charles E. Winter of the Nebraska League of Republican clubs returned yesterday from Detroit, where he was in attendance upon the meeting of the national league.  Mr. Winter was considerably elated over the success of the Nebraska delegation in securing the 1898 meeting of the national league for Omaha, but insisted that a large portion of the credit for that success belonged to the delegates from other states who had given very valuable assistance.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska delegation reached Detroit Sunday evening and the convention met Tuesday.  The place for the next meeting was not fixed by the convention until Thursday at about 1:30 p. m., but the entire time of the Nebraskans was occupied from Sunday until the convention adjourned in making votes for Omaha.  In this the delegation received strong support from the southern states, and Delegate T. H. Martin of Atlanta, the editor of a trade paper, "Dixie," was especially vigorous in his support of Omaha's cause.  Colonel "Dick" Woods of Sioux Falls, S. D., was another delegate who did much to further the efforts of the Nebraska delegation.  By reason of his wide acquaintance and influence with prominent members of the league he gave the Omaha advocates strong support.  Delegate Fairfield of North Adams, formerly a resident of Lincoln, and Delegate Long of Wisconsin, formerly an attorney of Omaha, both did good work, according to President Winter, and assisted materially in creating sentiment favorable to Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The invitation from Omaha was presented to the executive committee by Mr. Winter and the committee report was favorable, but the fight on the floor of the convention was a hot one.  Mr. Winter said the Chicago forces were well organized.  Their principal argument was that the hotel men of their city were starving for want of patronage and the convention must come there to save them from going to the wall.  A strong paid lobby was working constantly in the interests of Chicago, and Mr. Winter said tremendous pressure was brought to bear upon the convention in a number of ways.  The Chicago candidate for secretary was a strong man and would probably have been elected, but the sympathy for the old secretary, Dowling, who is without hands or feet, was too strong to overcome.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Winter said the Nebraska delegation formed no combinations to secure the next convention for Omaha, but depended upon the logic of the situation.  Kansas City was a strong opponent of Omaha, being in the field for the next convention, but when the Missouri and Kansas delegations saw that the meeting would go to Baltimore unless Omaha was chosen, they dropped their fight and voted for Omaha.  The Maryland delegation kept fighting to the last for Baltimore.</p>
                            <p>President Crawford is described by Mr. Winter as a Kentucky gentleman in every sense of the word, and both he and Secretary Dowling are said to be strong friends of Omaha, and disposed to do everything to have this city make a favorable showing for the convention.  The date of the convention was left to the president and the national committeeman from Nebraska.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Prof. Taylor Tells His Experience at Minneapolis.</head>
                            <p>Prof. F. W. Taylor, superintendent of the Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Irrigation of the Department of Exhibits, has returned from Minneapolis, where he attended the annual convention of the American Association of Agricultural Colleges and Experimental Stations.</p>
                            <p>The next convention will be held in Omaha and Prof. Taylor was feeling rather jubilant over the manner in which the Nebraska delegation deliberately walked off with the prize, while the other delegates were unconscious that the operation was being performed.  He stated that it has always been an unwritten law that every second meeting of the society should be held in Washington, and the delegates from other states took it for granted that this custom would be followed.  They conceded, however, that Omaha might get some advertizing out of the matter by calling the attention of the convention to the fact that an exposition was to be held in 1898.  This quiet confidence was taken advantage of and the Nebraska delegates did some tall logrolling before the time came to fix the place and date of the next meeting.  Chancellor MacLean of the Nebraska university presented an invitation from the state authorities, and Prof. Taylor followed with an invitation from the exposition and city authorities.  A delegate from Montana seconded the motion of Chancellor MacLean that the invitation be accepted, and before the other delegates awoke to the situation the selection had been made.</p>
                            <p>This convention was attended in Minneapolis by about 250 people, but Prof. Taylor thinks that the Omaha meeting will be attended by a much larger number.  The convention continues three days under ordinary conditions.</p>

                            <p>City Electrician Schurig is laying wires to secure another convention for this city during exposition year.  The body is the International Association of Fire and Police Telegraphers.  This year it meets in Nashville on September 14 and 15.  Electrician Schurig will try to be present at the meeting, but in the event that he will be prevented from doing so on account of the Ak-Sar-Ben festivities, through the mails he is booming the city as the place for holding the next convention.</p>
                            <p>At this year's Nashville meeting an attempt will be made to consolidate with the telegraphers the Association of Electrical Workers of the United States.  If this is accomplished, next year's meeting will call together some 600 or 700 men.  They will come from all parts of the United States and Canada.  Electrician Schurig is at present a member of both bodies.</p>

That was the decision reached at an important meeting held Friday night.</p>
                            <p>According to the plans laid out at the meeting the capital stock of the society will be $25,000.  This is to be divided up into shares of $5 each.  Within one week after the shares are subscribed, a 10 per cent assessment will become due.  Thereafter assessments of not more than 20 per cent a month may be called.</p>
                            <p>No permanent officers of the society will be elected until a considerable number of shareholders are secured.

                            <p>The persistent efforts of the Omaha members of the Western Travelers' Accident association have at last met with success and the next annual meeting of the association will be held in this city during the week of the state fair next fall.  It has been customary for the association to hold its meetings at Grand Island where the headquarters are located.  The Omaha members began their efforts to have an exception made to the rule this year some time ago, but at a meeting held at the Murray hotel last Saturday night it seemed that the efforts would fail, as the officers of the association were disposed to object.  Yesterday, however, consent of these officers was obtained, and the meeting will be held in this city as above announced.  To complete the arrangements for the meeting the members of the association living in Omaha will have another meeting at the Murray hotel next Saturday night and a full attendance is expected.</p>

                            <p>The participation of Nebraska counties in the exposition promises to be on an extensive scale.  This matter is being agitated in many of the counties of the state and preparations are being made to have the resources of these counties properly exploited.  Greeley county has made an appropriation for this purpose and the work of gathering the grains, grasses and other materials, which can only be secured now for next year, is well under way.  Platte county has taken the matter up and the secretary of the Board of County Commissioners, Gus G. Becher, has written the exposition authorities for all information regarding space, etc.  He also asks for plats of the main buildings, details regarding locations for county exhibits and other comprehensive matters.  Other counties are taking this matter up and there are indications that when the gates are opened many Nebraska counties will be prepared to show the world the manifold resources of the state.</p>

                            <p>W. I. Kierstead of this city, who is one of the delegates from Nebraska to the Transmississippi congress in session at Salt Lake City last week, introduced the following resolutions endorsing the Transmississippi Exposition, which was unanimously adopted:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, This congress at its last session did by unanimous resolution propose the holding of a Transmississippi Exposition at the city of Omaha, to be held from June 1 to November 1, 1898, which will illustrate to the world the great resources of the transmississippi country; and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The great purpose so inaugurated has assumed tangible form and plans for the enterprise have been duly adopted; and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The national government has appropriated $200,000 for a government building and exhibit and the citizens of Omaha have raised $500,000 by subscription and many of the states embraced in the transmississippi region have already made appropriations for suitable state exhibits, making altogether more than $1,000,000 now available; now, therefore, be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That this congress does reiterate its endorsement of said Transmississippi Exposition, and most respectfully recommends and petitions the several states and territories to give their substantial support and encouragement to the same by making exhibits of their several interests and resources, creditable to each and commensurate with the magnitude of this great enterprise; and that the several states and territories, whose legislatures meet during the coming winter, make liberal appropriations to further proper exhibits of their respective states and territories.</p>

                            <p>The Minneapolis Journal, in speaking of the efforts made by Chancellor George E. MacLean of the University of Nebraska to secure the next annual convention of the Association of American Agricultural Colleges and Experimental Stations, said:</p>
                            <p>If the twelfth annual convention of the Association of American Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations is not held in Omaha it will be through no failure of the eloquence of Chancellor George E. MacLean.  With an effective speech Dr. MacLean carried the convention by storm this morning.  He secured the adoption of a resolution favoring Omaha as the next place of meeting.  At first the resolution was received with scant favor.  The selection lies with the executive committee, and it was urged against the resolution that it trenched upon the domain of that governing body.  To this Dr. MacLean wittily rejoined that even the most humble might approach the Almighty with prayers and petitions, and that even the honorable and infallible executive committee could hardly object to receiving a modest petition as that incorporated in the resolution.  This was followed up with some well-chosen arguments and the resolutions went through with a rush.  Of course, the executive committee may not heed the recommendation, but it is likely to have a large weight in determining the place of the next meeting.</p>

Van Duzen &amp; Co., the Cincinnati bell founders who applied for the right to place a chime of bells in one of the towers on the exposition grounds, has informed the Department of Exhibits that the space under the roof of the Administration arch which was suggested as a location for the chimes is not suitable for that purpose on account of the absence of necessary acoustic properties.  It is probable that some other place will be selected for these bells.</p>

                            <head type="sub">This Interest Will Rapidly Increase Now That the Work of Erecting Buildings is to be Commenced.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The exposition ground is the most popular resort in town.  Thousands of people visit there every day in carriages, on bicycles and on foot.  The process of making ready for the magic city which is soon to adorn the site seems to possess an entrancing interest.  To some the work seems to be dragging on with unwarranted slowness, while others are astonished at the progress which has been made.  The latter belong to the class who have some adequate conception of the tremendous amount of work which must be done before the actual work of preparing the grounds can commence.  They realize that the progress which has been made on the construction work of the Transmississippi Exposition in a little over four months represents work which occupied Chicago a year and a half.</p>
                            <p>March 1 of this year the architects-in-chief were employed and since that time the ground has been surveyed, the arrangement of it determined, the buildings designed, the grading of the lagoon and the ground of the main court nearly completed, the working drawings of five of the eight main buildings completed, the contract let for one building, the foundation in for it, the contract for another to be let next Thursday, and two more buildings ready for the advertisement for bids.  Only those familiar with the enormous amount of detail work represented by the summing up covered by this last sentence can appreciate the amount of western push and energy which has been utilized to bring the work to its present stage in the limited time employed.</p>

                            <head type="sub">FROM CORNFIELD TO PARK.</head>
                            <p>The ground of the main court is now beginning to assume form and to give a faint idea of the beauty with which it will be adorned when the gates in the Arch of States are opened to the public June 1, 1898.  From a cornfield surrounded by a barb wire fence the ground on which the main architectural features of the show are to be centered has been transformed, and but little imagination is required to people it with the vast throngs which will crowd the magnificent buildings which will be reflected in a thousand shadows in the silver waters of the lagoon.</p>
                            <p>The canal has been almost completed and workmen are engaged in dressing the banks and preparing the approaches which will lead to the water's edge.  The roadway around the lagoon has become quite popular, notwithstanding its unfinished and rough condition.  The earth from the lagoon has been placed on the sides and has not been leveled off as it will be when the proper time comes, so that as a roadway it is not exactly ideal, but this trifling circumstance does not seem to make any difference to the thousands of people who drive from one end of the lagoon to the other every day.</p>
                            <p>The open space along the lagoon will afford excellent opportunity for the exercise of the skill of the landscape gardener.  This is especially true at the east end of the lagoon.  The top of the bank at this end will be about twelve feet above the level of the water and the earth about the circular end has been sloped backward, giving a steep incline which is in full view of all parts of the main court.  A pretty conceit in connection with this incline has been suggested by T. R. Kimball, one of the architects-in-chief.  His idea is to have this bank a mass of potted plants in full bloom, giving the effect of a mass of color as seen from a distance.  His plan is to have all the plants of one kind and of uniform size, and to change the color each week, having all heliotrope one week, a scarlet flower the next week, then a mass of white blossoms, and so on, to the end of the floral color scale.  Mr. Kimball says the plan is entirely practical and could be executed with very little expense as the flowers would not be removed from their pots and would not be injured in the least by the operation.</p>

                            <p>The question of an art display is a matter which is giving the members of the executive committee considerable food for thought at this time.  An art building has been arranged for and the design for it has been completed.  It will be a work of art in itself, but the scope of the art exhibit is the point upon which the executive committee is at present undecided.  One thing has been conceded from the beginning.  The art exhibit will be made meritorious and will not be suffered to degenerate into a mediocre affair which will reflect upon the community which gave it birth.  This section of the United States has a lower percentage of illiteracy than any other part of the union, and the artistic taste of the people will be exemplified in the art exhibit.  A committee of members of the Western Art association will have charge of the Art department under the direction of the executive committee.  One plan suggested is to give prominence to the development in mural decoration, a feature which has not been presented by former expositions.  In this section might be shown the work of the Mural Painters' society&#8212;such men as Walter Shirlaw, E. H. Blaishfield, Kenyon Cox and other members, whose work in the Boston library, Congressional library, Philadelphia city hall, and the Corcoran art gallery has won for them high distinction in the world of art.  It is also proposed to show all modern methods of reproduction in photography, and every other means, and to exhibit the most artistic photographs of the greatest pictures in the galleries of the world.</p>

                            <p>The exposition has attracted to Omaha noted decorators and sculptors, who desire to be given an opportunity to assist in producing some of the statuary, bas relief work and other forms of decorative work which will be liberally employed in giving an artistic finish to the exposition buildings and grounds.  The latest of these artists to visit Omaha was Sculptor Moretti of New York, who has many works of art in this country, which will endure for generations as monuments of his skill and art.  Prominent among these is the famous Vanderbilt monument at Nashville.  Moretti was a pupil of Dupre, the famous sculptor and artist of Florence, Italy, and is well known in this country.  He has been at the Nashville exposition, where he has many examples of his work, and came around by Omaha, en route to New York.  He brought with him a number of sketches and designs suggestive of decorations for the exposition buildings, both interior and exterior, as well as sketches of statuary intended to be made in imitation bronze, and several photographs of staff reproductions of noted works of art, suitable for a place in the art building.</p>

                            <p>With the Transmississippi Exposition ten months off the Omaha terminal railroads have formally taken up the subject of rates into Omaha during the exposition.  The general passenger agents of the lines leading into Omaha have taken time by the forelock in this matter, believing that better rates may be secured and better traffic arrangements negotiated if ample time be allowed for the work.</p>
                            <p>At a recent meeting of general passenger agents held in the headquarters of the Elkhorn railroad, a resolution was unanimously adopted, appointing a permanent committee to consider rates for the Transmississippi

Lomax, general passenger agent of the Union Pacific; John R. Buchanan, general passenger of the Elkhorn; Charles A. Rutherford, general passenger agent of the Rock Island's passenger department; and Thomas F. Godfrey, city passenger and ticket agent of the Missouri Pacific.  Of this committee Mr. Buchanan was chosen permanent chairman.  Regular meetings of the committee will be held from now until the exposition shall have closed, and all passenger traffic matters in connection therewith settled.  The meetings will be held at the Elkhorn headquarters on the first Tuesday of each month at 3 o'clock p. m.</p>

                            <head type="sub">TO GET RID OF BROKERS.</head>
                            <p>A member of the committee stated that strenuous efforts would be made to devise ways and means for thwarting the operations of ticket brokers during the exposition.  He said if the railroads could be assured that they would be protected from the brokers during the exposition, better rates into Omaha by at least 25 per cent could be obtained than if the brokers were allowed to handle the cheap railroad tickets that will be sold into Omaha on account of the great show.  Some of the passenger men were in favor of a city ordinance, taxing the brokers so high that the tax during the exposition would be practically prohibitive, but as a similar plan was tried at Nashville, only to be overthrown by the supreme court of Tennessee, it is not likely to be attempted here.  It is altogether likely that some new means of dealing with the question will be devised.  The work of the committee at the start will be largely historical.  The history of passenger rates and the volume of traffic attracted to every exposition that has been held in this country during the last quarter of a century is to be studied by the committee before any attempt is made to secure low rates for the Transmississippi Exposition.  The members of the committee are a unit on securing for Omaha the best rates possible, and will work not only with their own railroad companies, but with all others in the United States toward this desideratum.  Later on the passenger men will take up the subject with their respective general managers.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rutherford of the Rock Island went into Chicago last evening to consult with higher officials of that road on the matter.</p>

                            <p>The artesian well at the exposition grounds is the principal point of interest for visitors to the grounds.  It is surrounded by people nearly all the time and great interest is manifested in the progress which it is making.  There is a steady flow of water at the rate of about twenty-five or thirty gallons per minute, but the drill is still going down, and it will not stop until a larger flow is reached.</p>
                            <p>Contractor Nebergall states that the water bearing rock in this vicinity is about 1,000 feet below the surface and almost invariably lies in strata arranged in the same manner.  A thick layer of limestone is first penetrated by the drill, then a layer of sandstone, then another of limestone, followed by sandstone; then comes another layer of limestone and last of all a thick layer of sandstone where the largest flow of water is struck.  The first layer of sandstone has been penetrated and the drill is working in the second layer of limestone.  Mr. Nebergall estimates that the formation is about thirty-five feet in thickness altogether, and says he will probably reach the lower ledge of sandstone within the next two or three days.</p>
                            <p>When this point is reached, it is proposed to "shoot" the well by placing a large charge of nitro-glycerine at the bottom and exploding it.  This is intended to open up seams in all directions and increase the quantity of water.  The well is but six inches in diameter, and only a limited quantity of water could flow from it unless a large reservoir was opened at the bottom, and this is the purpose of the nitro-glycerine.</p>

                            <p>The levelling of the bluff tract of the exposition grounds is proceeding in a satisfactory manner.  The earth is simply being moved from one point to another and the ground made more even.  When this is done the landscape architect will take the tract in charge and lay out the walks, and make arrangements for the horticultural display which will form a prominent feature of this portion of the grounds.  The various concessionaires will soon begin the erection of their buildings, some of which will be on the most elaborate scale, requiring the expenditure of considerable money.  Some of these building will cost as much as $25,000, and many of them will reach almost to this figure.  The erection of some of the mechanical concessions will require considerable time and their construction will be commenced this summer.</p>
                            <p>The Horticultural building and the Dairy and Apiary building, which were ordered by the executive committee at its last meeting, will be located on the bluff tract and several of the smaller buildings will occupy a portion of it.</p>
                            <p>The bluff tract is designated to be a pleasure resort and it will be made a most attractive place for visitors, the purpose being to have it arranged along artistic lines in keeping with the architectural beauty of the main court.</p>

The front of the building is the same length as the auditorium, with which it pairs, the Art building being located east of the Arch of the States and the Auditorium standing west of it, both on the south side of the lagoon.</p>
                            <p>The open court between the two sections of the Art building has a loggia extending all around it, the front wall of this loggia connecting the front walls of the two buildings, forming a continuous facade.  The building is Roman classic in style, the rich ornamentation of the Roman period being strongly in evidence.  Each building is in the form of a Greek cross, surmounted by a flat dome at the center.  The Corinthian order dominates the whole building.  The inner galleries of the building will be lighted from the top in order to save all the wall space for pictures and to give the proper light for sculpture and paintings.  The court between the buildings will be filled with architectural fragments, while palms and other plant life will form an artistic setting for the whole.</p>
                            <p>The Art building will be fireproof in order to give the proper protection to the paintings and other valuable works of art which will be housed in the structure.</p>
                            <p>At each end of the building will be an esplanade, surrounded by a balustrade, making a beautiful approach, which will be reached by winding walks through small parks arranged in the stiff Italian style.</p>

                            <p>The Machinery and Electricity building has been issued in perspective by the architects-in-chief of the exposition and will soon be placed before the public through the press.  The drawing shows a building of general rectangular mass with a "clear story," an arcaded gallery extending along the entire front.  This gallery is surmounted by a balustrade, forming a promenade which will be accessible to the public and which will be ornamented by plants.</p>
                            <p>A rectangular pavilion forms each corner of the building and each of these pavilions is surmounted by a group of statuary symbolizing the contests between intellect and brute force.  A man of athletic proportions is seen wrestling with a wild animal which is overpowering him.  The central group of statuary, surmounting the main portion of the building, is a quadriga, symbolizing the victory of intellect over force.  In this group the man is standing in a chariot, driving four wild animals which are completely subdued.</p>
                            <p>The ornamentation of the Machinery and Electricity building is unique.  Instead of following the rigid rules of architectural ornamentation, this building will be beautified with representatives of chains, circular saws, cog wheels, screws, nails, sash chains and other mechanical devices.</p>
                            <p>The Machinery and Electricity building will stand at the northeast corner of the main court, facing south.  The architect of this building is Dwight H. Perkins of Chicago.</p>

                            <p>County Commissioner W. I. Kierstead returned yesterday from Salt Lake City, where he attended the meeting of the Transmississippi Commercial congress as a delegate from this county.  He reports that the interest manifested in the Transmississippi Exposition by the members of the congress was most enthusiastic and he says that the delegates from every transmississippi state promised most emphatically that their state would be represented in a creditable manner at the exposition.  Mr. Kierstead said this feeling was manifested when he introduced him resolution endorsing the exposition and recommended that every state in the transmississippi region participate.  Strong speeches were made in support of this resolution by Colonel John Doniphan of St. Joseph, W. J. Bryan and others, and the resolution was adopted by an almost unanimous vote.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kierstead said the people of Salt Lake City manifested especial interest in the exposition and said they would take a large amount of the material forming the Mormon jubilee exhibit and use this as a nucleus for an exhibit at the exposition.  Delegates from other states promised to stir the people of their sections to renewed efforts and much enthusiasm was shown which inspired Commissioner Kierstead with the belief that the failure of many of the legislatures to make appropriations would not prevent those states from making a good showing.</p>

                            <p>Bids for the construction of the Manufactures' building of the Transmississippi Exposition were opened by Manager Kirkendall and Superintendent Geraldine of the Department of Buildings and Grounds yesterday afternoon.  There were ten bids in all, four being received from Chicago, one from St. Louis and five from Omaha contractors.  The figures were highly satisfactory to the exposition authorities, being considerably below the maximum of cost fixed by the executive committee.  The bids on the carpenter, staff and plastering work were submitted separately, the total of the lowest in each class being $38,483.  The cost limit fixed by the executive committee for this building was $75,000.  Architect-in-Chief Kimball stated that the finishing of the building, including sculpture, painting, retouching next spring and decorating, would cost not to exceed $12,000 making the total cost of the completed building about $50,000.</p>
                            <p>Two of the bidders submitted figures on the building complete, McArthur Bros. of Chicago, $47,864, and Goldie &amp; Sons of Chicago, $50,740.  These firms did not make bids on the staff or carpentry separately.  For the staff or carpentry separately.  For the staff and plastering there were three bids, as follows: Rocheford &amp; Gould, Omaha, $14,600; F. A. Seifert, St. Louis, $14,850; Smith &amp; Eastman, Chicago, $9,608.  On the carpenter work there were six bids, as follows: R. A. Esthel, Omaha, $33,514.91; Murdock, Campbell &amp; Co., Chicago, $36,663; J. M. Swaziek, Omaha, $42,020; A. G. Wahlstrom, Omaha, $42,514; Rocheford &amp; Gould, Omaha, $33,700; R. C. Strehlow, Omaha, $28,875.  Each of the bidders on the carpentry work make certain allowances for the pile foundation, providing it is put in by the exposition authorities.  These reductions were from $900 to $1,800.  Several bidders also stated the time they would require to complete the building, running from sixty to 285 days, the latter being the time fixed by Swaziek of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>Smith &amp; Eastman of Chicago were the lowest bidders on the staff and R. C. Strehlow of Omaha was lowest on the carpentry, the total of their binds being $38,483.  Strehlow offered a reduction of $1,700 if the foundation is put in by the exposition authorities,

Mr. Pollock is a newspaper man, and was connected with the Milwaukee Sentinel for several years.  He was secretary of the Semi-Centennial Exposition association of Milwaukee until that organization concluded to abandon the idea of having an exposition.  He states that there is a lively interest being taken by the manufacturers of Wisconsin in the Transmississippi Exposition, and he anticipates that a large exhibit will be made by them.  As the manufacturing interests of that state are extensive and varied, Mr. Pollock promises an exhibit which will be of more than usual interest.</p>

Frank A. Tidd acted as chairman.  Considerable figuring has been done by the local members of the order for the purpose of raising funds to put into the building.  The structure as planned will cost $3,000 and it is proposed that all the lodges throughout the transmississippi region be asked to donate certain amounts.  The committees reported progress last evening but no definite plans were adopted for the raising of the fund.  The question of consolidating the meeting place of all the lodges in the city was also brought up.  It was proposed that Myrtle hall in the <choice><sic>Contenential</sic><corr>Continental</corr></choice> building be used for this purpose.  The matter is to be laid before the different lodges and a report will be made at the next meeting of the committees.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, July 21.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;If foreign governments are not made familiar with the fact that Omaha is going to hold an exposition next year it will not be the fault of the State department nor of the Nebraska delegation now in congress.  Today Senators Thurston and Allen, Representative Mercer, Dudley Smith and W. F. Gurley called on the president with a view of securing additional recognition from the government for the Transmississippi Exposition.  The senate resolution introduced by Allen, calling upon the executive to make proclamation of the international character of the exposition was presented to the president, with a request that, if consistent with the public service, he take official notice of the exposition.  President McKinley expressed himself most enthusiastically in favor of the exposition, but not desiring to interfere with the State department directed a letter to Acting Secretary Adee with a request that he comply with the desire of the delegation for a supplemental letter to the American ministers at foreign courts.  Consequently Secretaries Adee and Gridler, the latter having gone as far as he thought consistent in his former letter, drafted an addition advice which will be signed by the secretary tomorrow.  This letter will remind our foreign representatives that Omaha will hold an exposition next year and that it is the president's request that invitations be extended to foreign governments to participate.  The draft of the letter was heartily approved by the delegation.</p>
                            <p>Dudley Smith who goes abroad in interest of the Transmississippi Exposition, contemplates sailing on Saturday.  He had hoped to be the bearer of the president's proclamation and may yet have that distinction as Senator Thurston will call on Mr. McKinley in the morning to urge executive recognition of the exposition.  Hope of passing the joint resolution through the house has been abandoned, but should the president issue a proclamation as he agreed to, it is thought it will give the exposition a stronger standing than even a letter issued by the State department.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The Apiary building and its exhibits are the subject of consideration at the hands of the management of the Transmississippi Exposition at this time.  At the last meeting of the executive committee, the Department of Buildings and Grounds was authorized to ask for competitive drawings for this building, and the department is now making investigations into the question of the most approved plans for buildings designed for this purpose.  Local architects will be asked to submit drawings as soon as it has been determined what manner of building will best answer the purpose.</p>
                            <p>This is a matter in which the hundreds of bee keepers in this section are vitally interested.  The Iowa state commission was especially inquisitive about the arrangements which were to be made for the display of exhibits representing the extensive apiary interests of that state and representatives of the Nebraska bee keepers have been inquiring into the matter.  Iowa stands at the head of the list of states in the extent of her apiary interests and the amount of business represented.  Nebraska is not far behind and it rapidly forging to the front.</p>

                            <p>G. W. Hervey, one of the best local authorities on bees and apiarian interests generally, was at exposition headquarters this morning consulting with the Department of Exhibits regarding apiary exhibits.  Mr. Hervey stated that the apiarian interests of Nebraska are rapidly increasing and will soon compare favorably with any state in the union.  He said there are now about 1,000 bee keepers in this state and they have been remarkably successful in increasing their stock of bees, owing partly to the fact that this entire section has been singularly free from the diseases which usually attack the industrious little insects.  The recent scourge which swept across the section immediately contagious to Omaha, Mr. Hervey stated, was confined almost entirely to Omaha <unclear reason="torn"/>ection adjacent; aside from this he said there had been no general disease among the bees of this state.  He also said that this state has a larger variety of honey plants than any other state in the union and these conditions will undoubtedly result in a very large increase in the apiarian interests in the near future.</p>
                            <p>It is generally believed among bee men that E. Whitcomb of Friend will be appointed by the Nebraska Exposition commissioner to have charge of the apiary section of the state's exhibit.  Mr. Whitcomb was president of the Nebraska Bee Keepers' association for a long time, and was in charge of the state's apiary exhibit at the World's fair.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Exhibits authorizes the official announcement that it contemplates erecting the cases for installing the exhibits in the Apiary building, and will charge exhibitors $1.50 per square foot for floor space in these cases.  This is regarded as a most reasonable charge, and the announcement is made to correct a rumor which had been circulated among bee men to the effect that a rate of $10 per foot was to be charged them for space.</p>

                            <p>Governor Silas A. Holcomb, Lincoln, Neb.: My Dear Governor&#8212;I write to suggest that now,a s the act, under which the state will participate in the exposition, has been fully complied with, if it meets your approval, a proclamation be issued by your excellency to the people of this state, stating the fact that the provisions of the act of the legislature have been fully complied with, and that under this act the state of Nebraska will participate in the exposition, and requesting all counties, cities and citizens of the state to lend their assistance and best efforts in behalf of this enterprise to the end that the state of Nebraska may be properly represented and advertised through this great enterprise, and that its success may reflect due credit on the great state in which it will be held.</p>
                            <p>I am satisfied that such an official proclamation by you would arouse an interest throughout the state to the importance of the exposition which is not at present manifest.</p>
                            <p>I find on examination that at the Midwinter fair at San Francisco the governor of California <choice><sic>isued</sic><corr>issued</corr></choice> an official invitation, inviting the participation of all other states of the union in that exposition.  These invitations were sent out by the governor under seal of the state to the governors of all other states, and we would be under many obligations to you if you would make a similar official announcement and invitation to the governors of all the states of the union outside of the transmississippi states, whose governors have already appointed representatives, inviting the participation of all these states and asking that the governors appoint commissioners to represent their states, that friendly intercourse and commercial relations may be increased between all parts of the union by this great interstate and international exposition.</p>
                            <p>Will you kindly give these two suggestions your careful consideration and advise me at an early date of your conclusions, and oblige.</p>

                            <p>The twenty-fifth annual convention of the International Association of Fire Engineers will be held at New Haven, Conn., beginning August 20.  It is expected that the convention will be one of the biggest ever held by the association, and the New Haven people are taking elaborate preparations for the entertainment of their guests.  The mayor of the city is an ex-fire chief, and as the present chief of the New Haven fire department expects to retire at an early date on account of his age, they propose to make the convention a record breaker.</p>
                            <p>It is scarcely likely that Omaha will be represented at the convention.  The expense of taking such a trip is a considerable item, and as the sentiment of the city council is taking a somewhat economical tone recently, that body is not likely to pay the bills.  Chief Redell is confident that the 1898 convention could be secured for Omaha if it was gone after in the right way, but this would be attended with a large expense, for which there is no apparent provision.</p>

                            <head type="sub">FOR A LARGER HORTICULTURAL BUILDING</head>
                            <head type="sub">Exposition Executive Committee Decides on Separate Buildings for Apiary and Dairy Products&#8212;Architect Appointed.</head>
                            <p>At the meeting of the executive committee of the exposition this afternoon, it was decided that the amount set aside for the construction of the Horticultural building at the last meeting, $25,000, was entirely too small.  The manager of the Department of Buildings and Grounds stated that the architects had gone over the matter very carefully and had decided that the amount named would be too small to erect a building which would be creditable.  It is the intention to locate the Horticultural building on the lower end of the bluff tract, where it will stand alone.  It was considered that this situation would require a building of imposing proportions.  After discussing the matter, the committee decided to increase the <choice><sic>alowance</sic><corr>allowance</corr></choice> for this building to $35 000.</p>
                            <p>The next action was to rescind the motion passed at the last meeting, requiring the <choice><sic>eDpartment</sic><corr>Department</corr></choice> of Buildings and Grounds to ask for competitive drawings on the Horticulture and the Dairy and Apiary buildings.  It was stated that the local architects were opposed to the idea of making competitive drawings for the reason that the unsuccessful competitors would receive nothing for their time and work.  It was decided to appoint architects to design these buildings.  Charles F. Beindorff was appointed as architect of the Horticulture building, he to make the plans, detail drawings, specifications and all other work except superintend the construction.</p>
                            <p>The Dairy and Apiary building was then taken up, and it was decided to make separate buildings for exhibits in these classes.  The sum of $15,000, set aside at the last meeting for the combined building of the Apiary and Dairy building, was divided, and two buildings will be erected, the Dairy building to cost $8,000 and the Apiary building to cost $7,000.  Charles Cleves was appointed architect of both buildings, the conditions being the same as in the case of the Horticultural building.</p>
                            <p>The completed drawings of the Auditorium building was received from Fisher &amp; Lawrie <choice><sic>o fthis</sic><corr>of this</corr></choice> city, and were inspected by the committee.  The Department of Buildings and Grounds was instructed to advertise for bids for the construction of this <choice><sic>buiuding</sic><corr>building</corr></choice>.</p>

                            <p>The state of Kansas will take an active part in the Transmississippi Exposition, according to the assurances given by the governor of that commonwealth to E. C. Hunt, the representative of the Department of Publicity and Promotion, who visited the state this week in the interest of the exposition.  The governor promised that he would at once consult with the leading men of Kansas regarding the appointment of a state commission and the making of an exhibit representative of the state.  The governor suggested several public-spirited men who would probably serve in the capacity of commissioners and said he would consult with them regarding the matter before making any public announcement.</p>
                            <p>The governor also stated that a special session of the legislature would probably be called this winter to take action in the matter of enacting railway legislation.  He agreed that a call for a special session should include the consideration of an appropriation for representation at the exposition.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Manager Bruce of the department of exhibits, acting through Superintendent Taylor of the combined bureau of agriculture, horticulture and forestry, is getting the plans laid for an immense apple carnival at the exposition in the autumn of next year.  For several years the apple producing counties in Southwestern Iowa have united in a carnival.  It is proposed that they abandon the undertaking this year and next and join with the other apple raising sections of the trans-Mississippi country in a gigantic apple demonstration at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Taylor has had this feature under consideration ever since his connection with the department, and has been talking it up among the horticulturists of the country.  The first result of this is that a convention of representatives from all state horticultural societies in the trans-Mississippi region will be held in Omaha, August 12, to further consider the matter.  Prof. Taylor is just now sending out the invitations.</p>
                            <p>The main features of the carnival will be apple demonstrations and decorations of all sorts.  They will be everywhere.  They will be "in the atmosphere and also in the air."  The walks will be paved with them and carloads will be given away.  Thus far the scheme meets with much favor.</p>

                            <p>Walter W. Pollock, who will represent the exposition as commissioner in Wisconsin, is in the city for a conference with the exposition management.  Mr. Pollock was the secretary of the temporary organization for the promotion of the proposed semi-centennial exposition at Milwaukee.  He believes that a good exhibit will come from that state.  The manufacturers and other business concerns believe in exposition and are regretting that the plan to have one at Milwaukee was abandoned.  He thinks the space taken may be 15,000 or 20,000 feet.  There is some reason to hope, too, that the state will yet make an appropriation for the Trans-Mississippi exposition.  An adjourned session of the legislature will be held in August and if it is determined that anything save special business may be taken up by it the proposition to vote an appropriation will probably be presented.  Mr. Pollock, after a day or two in the city, will visit friends at Tarkio and Rockport, Mo., before returning to Milwaukee.</p>

                            <p>Superintendent Burns of the department of concessions has returned from Nashville, where he put in ten days visiting the exposition, paying special attention to the concessions.  He says that they have a much better exposition there than he expected to find, and have some very excellent sections and features.  He joins with others who have been there in praising the hospitality of the southern people.</p>
                            <p>The revised figures on the amount of Trans-Mississippi stock paid in to the end of July 20, when the 5 per cent arrangement ceased to operate shows that $220,349 has been received and of this amount about $45,000 is out of the 35 per cent of subscription not assessable until 1898.</p>
                            <p>W. M. Brewer of Alabama writes that the governor will in a few days designate a certain sum to be applied out of the state funds toward defraying the expense of a mineralogical exhibit from Alabama.  This is at the request of the state geologist.</p>

                            <p>The Omaha lodges of the Knights of Pythias are pushing their scheme for a building to be used as Pythian headquarters on the exposition grounds.  Frank A. Tidd presided over a meeting of the several committees at Royal Arcanum hall Tuesday night.  It is hoped that a building to cost about $3,000 may be constructed, and it is the expectation that the funds will be contributed by the lodges of the order in the Trans-Mississippi region.  However, a definite plan for the raising of the money has not been settled on.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Architect Follows the Style Adopted in the Greek Temples, Producing What is Considered a Beautiful Effect.</head>
                            <p>The perspective drawing of the Manufactures building was completed by the architects-in-chief of the exposition this morning.  This building is a companion of the Machinery building and faces it across the lagoon, both buildings being at the east end of the main court, the Machinery building on the north side and the Manufactures building on the south bank of the canal.  S. S. Beman of Chicago is the architect of the Manufactures building, and the stately beauty of the structure in which will be displayed the products of the liberal arts will form one of the most striking features of the imposing architectural effect presented by the main court.</p>
                            <p>The famous temple of Erectheion at Athens, one of the finest examples of the Greek Ionic architecture the world has ever seen, is shown in every line of the Manufactures building and the imposing beauty of this magnificent example of architectural effect has been utilized by Mr. Beman in designing a classic in every feature.  The Manufactures building is the same size as the Machinery building, 300x140 feet, and the style of the two building is harmonious in every sense, although they are not at all alike.  The building under discussion has a colonnade extending along its entire front, corresponding to the arcade which forms a striking feature of its companion on the opposite side of the lagoon.  The central motive of the Manufactures building is a circular pavilion extending some distance in front of the main line of the building.  This pavilion is formed of a richly decorated Ionic cornice carried on Ionic columns, which support symbolic figures standing out from the frieze.  This pavilion is surmounted by a flat dome.</p>
                            <p>At each corner of the building are pavilions which are rectangular to the height of the main cornice and are surmounted by circular temple forms.</p>
                            <p>The cornice of the building is very richly decorated with designs taken from the rich storehouse of the Green Ionic, and this form of decoration is used throughout the building.</p>
                            <p>The clear story windows are filled with rich ornamental grill work.</p>
                            <p>The interior of the entrance dome and the frieze below it will be richly decorated in color.  It is the intention of the architects in this, as in the other buildings in the main court, to use a considerable amount of color decoration to add to the richness of detail in giving the buildings artistic finish.</p>

                            <p>The failure of the legislature of Colorado to make an appropriation for a state exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition will not shut the state out entirely.</p>
                            <p>Two Colorado gentlemen who have had large experience in fairs and expositions throughout the world, will have what will certainly be a most novel and interesting concession at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>It will be interesting to Colorado people to know that there will be a Cripple Creek at Omaha.  Not a miniature or a model, but a wideopen town, just as it was in 1892 and 1893, with its stores, hotels, saloons, variety theaters, post express offices, miners' cabins, graveyard, mines and mills in operation, the town people by those who have lived and worked in mining camps.  There will

                            be stages, mule teams and burros, in fact everything necessary to make up the town as it really existed eighteen months after the Bennett &amp; Meyers cattle camp became the greatest gold camp in the world.  The management of this big undertaking is in the hands of Richard Norris, located at Elitch's gardens, Denver, and James H. Love of San Francisco, Cal., two well known promoters and managers of popular enterprises.</p>
                            <p>Cripple Creek at Omaha will be made the headquarters for visiting Coloradoians, and the newspaper of the camp, which will be a feature, will contain Colorado news exclusively.  Cripple Creek will cover 250,000 square feet of ground, and will be surrounded with scenic effects in cycloramic form, and be made as realistic as possible.</p>
                            <p>Pike's Peak from the west and Mount Pisgah will overlook the camp and be so constructed in profile that the perspective of the earth will be perfect.  Those who witnessed Mr. Love's Mount Shasta in San Francisco or in Chicago will vouch for his ability to construct a mountain sixty feet in height with a twenty or fifty-mile perspective that will deceive most any one.</p>
                            <p>Messrs. Norris &amp; Love will manage for Colonel T. Wahn Morgan Draper the big society circus which will be given in Denver early in September, after which Mr. Norris will establish an office in Cripple Creek, while Mr. Love will open one in Omaha, lay the camp out, begin its construction and have it completed in every detail ready for the opening of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>Council Bluffs will make a systematic effort to promote the interests of the Transmississippi Exposition, and will endeavor to create and lead a movement that will have for its object the awakening of an interest throughout the western part of the state that will be as personal as that felt generally by the people of Council Bluffs and Omaha.  For this purpose a meeting has been called to be held at the city building on Tuesday evening.  The meeting has been called jointly by the officers of the Merchants' and Manufacturers' and the Business Men's associations.  The invitations issued by Secretary Judson yesterday invite the Grape Growers' association and all other business organizations in the city, as well as the Council Bluffs stockholders in the exposition, city and county officials and park commissioners.</p>
                            <p>There has long been a feeling among the live and wideawake men of Council Bluffs that the people of the city and western Iowa, who will receive the greatest and most direct benefit from the exposition, do not properly comprehend its magnitude and its importance to them.  It is believed that if there is a meeting of all of the representative men of the city some means can be devised to awaken the degree of interest that is beginning to be felt and should be manifesting itself by this time.</p>
                            <p>No set program will be followed, but it is expected that each man will come prepared to express his ideas and make suggestions that will prove of value.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Architect Follows the Style Adopted in the Greek Temples, Producing What is Considered a Beautiful Effect.</head>
                            <p>The perspective drawing of the Manufactures building was completed by the architects-in-chief of the exposition yesterday.  This building is a companion of the Machinery building and faces it across the lagoon, both buildings being at the east end of the main court, the Machinery building on the north side and the Manufactures building on the south bank of the canal.  S. S. Beman of Chicago is the architect of the Manufactures building, and the stately beauty of the structure in which will be displayed the products of the liberal arts will form one of the most striking features of the imposing architectural effect presented by the main court.</p>
                            <p>The famous temple of Erectheion at Athens, one of the finest examples of the Greek Ionic architecture the world has ever seen, is shown in every line of the Manufactures building and the imposing beauty of this magnificent example of architectural effect has been utilized by Mr. Beman in designing a building which shows the classic in every feature.  The Manufactures building is the same size as the Machinery building, 300x140 feet, and the style of the two buildings is harmonious in every sense, although they are not at all alike.  The building under discussion has a colonnade extending along its entire front, corresponding to the arcade which forms a striking feature of its companion on the opposite side of the lagoon.  The central motive of the Manufactures building is a circular pavilion extending some distance in front of the main line of the building.  This pavilion is formed of a richly decorated Ionic cornice carried on Ionic columns, which support symbolic figures standing out from the frieze.  This pavilion is surmounted by a flat dome.</p>
                            <p>At each corner of the building are pavilions which are rectangular to the height of the main cornice and are surmounted by circular temple forms.</p>
                            <p>The cornice of the building is very richly decorated with designs taken from the rich storehouse of the Green Ionic, and this form of decoration is used throughout the building.</p>
                            <p>The clear story windows are filled with rich ornamental grill work.</p>
                            <p>The interior of the entrance dome and the frieze below it will be richly decorated in color.  It is the intention of the architects in this, as in the other buildings in the main court, to use a considerable amount of color decoration to add to the richness of detail in giving the buildings artistic finish.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Omaha Parties Think They Have a Valuable Invention.</head>
                            <p>A scheme for lighting race tracks for night horse races has been patented by two Omaha men who purpose showing the same at the exposition and giving a practical example of the working of it.  The inventors are L. V. Morse and E. G. Solomon.  The claim made by the inventors is that the arrangement of the lights is such that all the light is thrown on the track, instead of into the eyes of the spectators, as by other systems, and they claim to have the lights so arranged as to avoid making shadows of the horses on the track.</p>
                            <p>The greatest complaint made by racing men concerning night racing is against the shadows which confuse the horses until they do not know whether they are racing shadows or competitors.  The inventors of the new system claim to have overcome this objection by means of searchlights placed at the turns and by overhead lights placed directly over the tracks.  It is claimed that the lights are so arranged that the horses can be plainly seen at any point on the track and that the lights are shaded in such a way that none of the rays shine in the eyes of the spectators.</p>

Mr. Hodgins is right at home in this line of work, as he was one of the moving spirits in the exposition held in the coliseum building a few years ago, and was the originator and executive officer in the "Nebraska exhibit trains," which were sent all over the east a few years ago to advertise Nebraska's resources to the world.  Mr. Hodgins has also been in the newspaper business for several years, and is at present the business manager of the Nebraska Trade Exhibit, a trade journal issued from Omaha.

The appointment of an architect for these two buildings will be tendered to another Omaha architect by Manager Kirkendall at once, as it is desired to have these buildings under way at once.</p>
                            <p>Charles F. Beindorff, who was assigned the Horticultural building by the executive committee, has accepted the position and will at once enter upon his work.  This building will stand almost alone upon the bluff tract and will afford a fine opportunity for the display of architectural skill.</p>

H. Griffith, director of the Art museum of Detroit, Mich., who is an applicant for the position.  Mr. Griffith was requested to come to Omaha for consultation with the executive committee and the committee of the Western Art association having charge of the art exhibit of the exposition.  He is expected to arrive about Wednesday of this week.  Mr. Griffith will probably be appointed as art director if the details can be arranged to the satisfaction of all concerned.

                            <head type="sub">MANUFACTURERS INTERESTED IN EXHIBITS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Commissioner for the Badger State Sees Good Reasons to Hope for a Creditable Exhibit in Omaha.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Several evidences of an active interest in the Transmississippi Exposition on the part of the manufacturers of Wisconsin, and especially of the city of Milwaukee, have come to light within the past few days.  Manager E. E. Bruce of the Department of Exhibits has received a number of mail applications for space, besides many inquiries from manufacturers and others desirous of information as to conditions upon which exhibits may be made.  The Schlitz Brewing company is one firm which has already closed negotiations for a large space, and several others are already planning to show their products.</p>
                            <p>Walter W. Pollock of Milwaukee, who was secretary of the Wisconsin semi-centennial committee which undertook to promote the Wisconsin exposition in 1898, and which <unclear reason="folded"/>ed because of the opposition of the ultra-conservative moneyed men of Milwaukee, is planning to get up a big Wisconsin exhibit in the Transmississippi Exposition.  He is in the city to consult with the exposition officials concerning the details of the work.  To a reporter he said:</p>
                            <p>"Although thousands of former Wisconsin people live in Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and the newer states of the west, comparatively few are aware of the great importance the Badger state has attained in recent years in manufacturing.  Milwaukee is a great beer making center, and the prosperity of the city is due in no small degree to the enterprise and liberality of Captain Pabst and the Uihlein brothers, who own the Schlitz brewery.  But the value of the Milwaukee beer product is not more than one-tenth of the manufacturing industries of the city.  Milwaukee could make a showing that would surprise the world, if the manufacturers could be awakened to a sense of the importance of showing their wares at Omaha next year.</p>
                            <p>"The Cudahy, Layton, Plankinton and Bodden packing houses have an annual product approximating to one-third of that of Omaha.  No city in the United States tans a greater amount of hide into leather than Milwaukee, and the city is near the top in the production of flour.  There are half a dozen great knitting factories which make a great variety of garments.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">VAST MACHINERY PLANT.</head>
                            <p>"A Milwaukee firm which recently closed a contract for enormous power engines to go to London has sent its mining, flour mill and saw mill machinery to all parts of the world.  There are four concerns which make a specialty of large machinery of every description, and a dozen which make harvesters and other farm machinery.  One of the largest factories for the making of stamped tinware does a business in Milwaukee which extends all over the country.  The annual output of manufactured clothing is about $5,000,000, of boots and shoes about $1,000,000, and so on through the list, which includes everything from the locomotive and cars and rails necessary to equip a railway down to the smallest articles necessary to the everyday life of the humblest citizen.</p>
                            <p>"What is true of Milwaukee is in a measure true of the entire state.  I recently saw a map showing the location of the cheese factories by dots, which showed the great importance of the dairying interest of the southern part of the state.  The northern third is covered with dense pine and hardwood forests, which will for many years continue to supply the west and southwest with lumber.  There are lead and zinc mines in the southwestern part of the state and iron in the northern.</p>
                            <p>"The city of Racine makes enormous quantities of agricultural machinery and vehicles; Sheboygan is supreme as a chair-producing center; the Fox river valley makes more paper than any other western district.  In fact the chapter of Wisconsin's industries is a long one, but I hope that it will be well indexed in the exhibit to be made at Omaha next year."</p>
                            <p>"What is the prospect of securing a state appropriation for an Omaha exhibit?"</p>
                            <p>"An adjourned session of the legislature will be held in August, and while there is no certainty that the legislators will do anything except adopt the new revised statutes, I believe that the proper effort on the part of the officials of the Omaha exposition would result in some official recognition of the great industrial event on the part of the state of Wisconsin."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Low Figures on Exposition Buildings Due to Fact that There is Plenty of Money in the Treasury.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The authorities of the Transmississippi Exposition are congratulating themselves upon the very favorable showing made by the bids received for the construction of the Manufactures and Liberal Arts building, the first of the large buildings on the main court for the construction of which bids have been asked.  The figures furnished the architects before the plans were made for this building fixed the limit of cost at $75,000.  The lowest bids received for the carpenter work and the staff work amounted to $38,483.  These bids do not cover the cost of the plumbing, painting, sculpture and other finishing, the total of which is estimated at about $10,000 or $12,000, making the total cost of the building, ready for occupancy, about $50,000, or about one-third lower than the estimated cost.</p>
                            <p>Taking these figures as a guide the exposition officials argue that the cost of constructing the entire exposition buildings and beautifying the grounds will be much less than was originally estimated, and it is believed that the income from stock subscriptions and all other sources up to the time of opening the gates will be sufficient to pay all the expenses of preparation, which is the greatest bugbear to all expositions.  If this reasoning proves good the Transmississippi Exposition will be the first of recent expositions in this country to open <unclear reason="covered"/>gates without being heavily in debt.  Instances have occurred where the gate re-<unclear reason="unclear"/> were mortgaged several times long before the gates were opened, and many other similar devices resorted to in order to complete the buildings sufficiently to throw the exposition open to the public.  No such condition confronts the Transmississippi Exposition, and it is the definite and settled policy of the management that no such course shall be followed.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">KEEPING COST WITHIN RESOURCES.</head>
                            <p>There has been a rigid determination on the part of those having the matter in charge to "cut the garment according to the cloth," and this method has been pursued from the start.  It is for this reason that the figures on the Manufactures building are especially gratifying.  They convey the assurance that the estimates made at the beginning will not be exceeded.</p>
                            <p>There are several reasons assigned for the low figures obtained on the Manufactures building.  Prominent among these reasons stands the fact that the exposition treasury is in a healthy condition.  In this connection the action of the legislature, in requiring that $200,000 should be paid in by stock subscribers of the exposition before the state appropriation of $100,000 could be made available, is regarded as a blessing in disguise.  It is generally conceded that the obstructionists who caused this clause to be inserted in the bill did not do so through a desire to aid the exposition management in making the affair a success, but that has been the direct effect of their action.  It was simply a coincidence that the act of the legislature was effective (provided the $200,000 was paid in) just about the time the Department of Buildings and Grounds was ready to begin asking for bids for the construction of the main buildings, but this coincidence is credited with being largely responsible for the low figures obtained on the theory that a contractor who contemplates bidding on a large building will invariably bid lower if he knows that when he is allowed an estimate on construction he can get the money without having to wait.  The fact that the Transmississippi Exposition has over $175 000 in its treasure was well known to all the contractors who submitted bids on the Manufactures building, and the effect of that knowledge is apparent on the face of the bids.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WORKING PLANS ARE PERFECT.</head>
                            <p>There are other factors which operated to bring these bids down to a point which is satisfactory both to the contractor and the exposition authorities.  One of these factors is the removal of every element of uncertainty on the part of the contractor.  The working drawings on all of the main buildings are being worked out to the smallest detail by the architect-in-chief, so that a contractor may know to a nicety just what material he will require to complete a given building.  Nothing is left to the imagination of the contractor and he is not compelled to allow a wide margin for material and labor which does not appear on the plan, but which will be required by the superintendent of construction.</p>
                            <p>The low price of building material and the progress which has been made in the erection of exposition buildings also contribute to reduce the expense of construction.  This last reason is especially applicable to the staff work.  At the Columbian exposition the manufacturing and working of staff was largely experimental and thousands of dollars were expended by the management of that enterprise in making experiments with different kinds of staff.  The men who did the work have profited by the knowledge thus gained at the expense of Chicago and are enabled to avoid the difficulties which beset the path of the Columbian exposition and the Transmississippi Exposition will derive the direct benefit by a marked reduction in the cost of the work.</p>
                            <p>Now that the buildings on the main court are about disposed of, those having in charge the directing of the general plan of operations are taking thought regarding some of the lesser details of the exposition grounds.  When the grounds were first arranged it was decided to locate a band stand on the bluff tract where a full-sized brass and reed band was to discourse popular music at all times.  The original plat of the grounds shows such a stand located at the east end of the viaduct leading across Sherman avenue from the main court to the bluff tract.</p>
                            </div3>     
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">PROVIDING FOR MUSIC.</head>
                            <p>It has lately been suggested that this stand be constructed near the edge of the bluff so that a larger number of people might gather around it, and it is suggested that a method of construction be adopted which is new in this section.  The departure consists in the construction of an immense sounding board at the back of the stand, or on the side toward the bluff, which will throw the sound over the bluff tract and give exposition visitors the benefit of the music instead of having the sound dissipated over the muddy waters of the Missouri.  This plan has been adopted in a public park near Philadelphia where the Damrosch orchestra is now playing, and it is said to be very satisfactory.</p>
                            <p>The question of transporting visitors from one part of the exposition grounds to another is a question which will receive the attention of the exposition management at an early day.  At the Columbian this was accomplished by an intramural railway, but this method is impracticable for the Transmississippi Exposition on account of the general plan of the grounds.  That some method of locomotion other than that furnished to most individuals by nature will be necessary will be conceded by those who have attempted to make the circle of the main court on foot.  This court is one-half mile in length and about an eighth of a mile in width.  A trip around it, especially if the several buildings are inspected, will be a fair day's work.  The same is true of either of the other tracts, and for anyone not a pedestrian the circle of the entire grounds would be a severe task.  It is conceded by those who have given thought to the matter that a railway is impracticable, but no decision has been reached as to the plan to be adopted to accomplish the desired result.</p>
                            <p>It is suggested that the solution of the difficulty lies in the motorcycle or horseless carriage.  These vehicles have been made entirely practicable and they can be operated any place where an ordinary buggy can be driven.  One firm of exhibitors has already asked for authority to operate one of these vehicles in connection with its exhibit as a means of advertising its display of textiles, etc.  It will be necessary to have driveways about the exposition grounds for the purpose of supplying the various establishments which will be in<unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission will hold its first legal meeting at the Dellone hotel this evening, and will probably continue in session all of tomorrow and perhaps a portion of Wednesday.  The members of the committee are these:</p>
                            <p>First Congressional District&#8212;H. M. Boydston, Nebraska City.</p>
                            <p>Second District&#8212;A. C. Whitford, Arlington.</p>
                            <p>Third District&#8212;W. A. Poynter, Albion.</p>
                            <p>Fourth District&#8212;C. D. Casper, David City.</p>
                            <p>Fifth District&#8212;W. M. Dutton, Hastings.</p>
                            <p>Sixth District&#8212;William Neville, North Platte.</p>
                            <p>The commission held a preliminary meeting in Lincoln July 13 and effected a temporary organization by elected Judge Neville chairman and C. D. Casper secretary.  No business was transacted, as the law making the state appropriation was not operative until Monday of last week.</p>
                            <p>Besides organizing in legal form the commission will probably transact a large amount of business in order to get its work well under way as soon as possible.  It is expected that an assistant secretary will be chosen who will be the executive officer of the commission.  A number of candidates are in the field for this position.  A superintendent of agriculture, a bookkeeper, stenographer, superintendent of building and a timekeeper will also probably be selected, thus organizing the work force of the commission.  The headquarters will be in this city, at some point to be selected by the commission, and all business will be done there.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">MUCH WORK TO BE DONE.</head>
                            <p>Members of the commission say there is an immense amount of work to be done in a short time, and that no time will be lost in getting the whole movement under headway.  Conferences will be held tonight and tomorrow with the representatives of the various organizations of the state which have asked the commission to set aside certain amounts of money to be used in promoting exhibits of various kinds.</p>
                            <p>Since the appointment of the commission the members have been flooded with letters from the different societies in the state asking that a portion of the state appropriation be set aside for making an exhibit in the class in which the writer is interested.  Thus the representatives of the dairy interests of the state want $3,000 set aside for showing the resources of the state in the dairy line; the Woman's Board of Managers has asked that $5,000 be used in buying space for the educational exhibit; the Beekeepers' association wants $2,500 used for assisting in making an exhibit of the apiarian interests; the Horticultural society has asked for $10,000, the various agricultural societies want $12,000 set aside for exploiting the agricultural resources of the state; people interested in irrigation want from $3,000 to $5,000 devoted to that purpose; the state fish commission has asked for $5,000; the live stock interests ask for $10,000, those interested in fine arts think $3,000 should be devoted to a display in that line, the florists want $1,500 used for a floral display and so on to the end of the chapter.  Representatives of these various interests will be consulted with, and the commission will endeavor to agree upon some plan for apportioning the state appropriation so as to produce the best result and satisfy all concerned.</p>
                            <p>The commission does not have the handling of a cent of the state appropriation.  All indebtedness incurred by the commission must be certified to the governor for his approval, after which the voucher goes to the state auditor, who draws a warrant and sends it to the person to whom the money is due and the warrant is cashed by the state treasurer.  The state commission has no treasurer.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Park Board Will Shoot the Exposition Well.</head>
                            <p>President Tukey of the Board of Park Commissioners says that drilling in the artesian well at the exposition grounds has been stopped for good.  The drill reached a depth of slightly more than 1,000 feet Saturday night and struck a layer of very hard lime rock, which effectually disposes of the expectation of getting any more water.  It is believed, however, that the flow already secured will be sufficient for the purpose.  President Tukey says that it is at least amply sufficient for the park and lake, but whether it can be made to answer for all exposition purposes is a question.  At present the flow is forty gallons a minute.  This affords a supply of 2,400 gallons an hour, or 57,600 gallons a day.  This would keep the lake full but would leave scarcely any surplus for other purposes.</p>
                            <p>The board will be better able to tell how much may be expected from the well after it has been shot and the pipe lowered to the rock.  At present the six-inch pipe has only been let down to a depth of about 700 feet and the water that now comes to the surface filters up around the outside of the pipe.  It is suspected that a great part of <unclear reason="torn"/>rest on the bottom of the well, the flow will be materially increased.</p>
                            <p>It is also possible that shooting the well with dynamite will increase the flow.  The drill has passed through three layers of water bearing sand.  A charge of probably 100 pounds of dynamite will be shot off at each layer.  This will tear big seams in the surrounding rock and open up cavities which may more than double the flow.  Sometimes the dynamite shot shuts off the flow altogether, but the board will take chances on that.</p>
                            <p>In case the flow is not increased there is some talk of putting in a pump.  The idea is that the supply of water reached by the well is practically inexhaustible, but that the pressure is not strong enough to bring it to the surface in sufficient quantities to answer all the requirements of the exposition.  But if the water is there, it could be pumped out in almost any quantity desired and it is thought that this would prove much more economical than any other source of water supply that has been suggested.</p>

                            <p>Prof. J. H. Gore, honorary commissioner for the Transmississippi Exposition to Switzerland and other European countries, writes to the Department of Concessions that the proprietor of a panorama of the Alps now on exhibition at the Brussels exposition is a prospective concessionaire at the Transmississippi Exposition.  Prof. Gore says the exhibit is a high class entertainment and a meritorious work.</p>
                            <p>Sweden is one of the countries to which Prof. Gore is accredited, and he says in his letter that he intends taking a trip there for the purpose of interesting the Swedish government in the exposition.  Incidentally, he suggests that he will look into the matter of securing a Swedish village for the exposition&#8212;a genuine article, organized in Sweden and showing the life and customs of the people of that country.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Delegates Go After Building and Loan Association Convention.</head>
                            <p>The Omaha delegates to the annual convention of the United States League of Local Building and Loan Associations will leave for Detroit tonight.  D. H. Christie, G. M. Nattinger and T. J. Fitzmorris will represent the Omaha associations, and it is expected that several of the association out in the state will send delegates.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska delegates expect to have no great difficulty in securing the 1898 convention of the league for Omaha.  A lot of hard work was done at the convention at Philadelphia last year, which resulted in the adoption of a resolution recommending Omaha as the location for 1898.  With that in their favor the delegates have no doubt of success this year.  So far there is no organized opposition to Omaha, but other aspirants will undoubtedly develop at Detroit.</p>
                            <p>The local delegates have supplied themselves with a lot of exposition literature, the pamphlets bearing on the title page the official seal of the exposition and references to the invitations extended to the league by the Board of Trade, the Commercial club, the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben and other local organizations.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Nattinger will accompany the delegation and improve the opportunity to visit her mother at Benton Harbor, Mich.</p>

                            <p>The people of Omaha probably do not yet appreciate the extensiveness of the advantages that will <choice><sic>acrue</sic><corr>accrue</corr></choice> from the meeting of so many societies in Omaha during the year 1898.  The sessions of these great bodies will be in themselves important features of exposition year and Omaha will do well to make every preparation to care for these bodies.</p>
                            <p>The national institute of Indian school employes will be held in July with at least 600 delegates.  This will be the first national institute of the kind ever held and will be of especial interest.</p>
                            <p>The Swedish Evangelical mission covenant of America will, it is estimated, bring from 2,000 to 3,000 delegates and will meet in May.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska Jewelers' association, with 100 delegates, will meet in June.</p>
                            <p>The National Dairymen's association will bring at least 300 delegates.</p>
                            <p>The American Nursery association will bring probably 200 delegates.</p>
                            <p>The National Electric will meet June 21 to 23 and will bring 300 delegates.</p>
                            <p>The National Association of Railway Postal Clerks will bring 600 delegates.</p>
                            <p>The American Institute of Homeopathy will be held in June and will bring 800 delegates to Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The Travelers' Protective association will also meet in June with 1,000 delegates in attendance.</p>
                            <p>The general assembly of the United Presbyterian church will have from 300 to 400 delegates and will meet the last Wednesday in May.</p>
                            <p>The Danish Lutheran church of America ought to bring at least 800 in June.</p>
                            <p>The American Fisheries society will bring perhaps 50 delegates in July.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska Funeral Directors' association will bring 400 delegates.</p>
                            <p>The Republican National league will bring 2,200 delegates and perhaps 2,000 additional visitors.</p>
                            <p>The National Educational association will bring 18,000 to 22,000.</p>
                            <p>The American Association of Agricultural Colleges and Experimental stations will bring perhaps 600.</p>
                            <p>The National Electric Light association is another organization which will meet in Omaha in exposition year, but we are unable to estimate the number of delegates to that body.</p>
                            <p>It is safe to say that these conventions already secured will bring at least 44,000 people to Omaha who will come especially to participate in the proceedings of their society.  But in the meantime every one of these people will be talking "Omaha" to their friends and this will be the means of bringing many others to this city.</p>
                            <p>The exposition year is full of promise to Omaha and every citizen of Omaha ought to put his shoulder to the wheel and help in making that year the greatest in Omaha's future.</p>

                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission met at the Dellone hotel in this city last night to commence the active work for which it was created.  All the members were present.  The meeting held last night was the first meeting since the state appropriation of $100,000 became available.</p>
                            <p>The first business transacted by the commission was the selection of headquarters.  Propositions were considered from three hotels, and it was decided to establish the offices and headquarters of the commission in the Dellone hotel annex, at the northeast corner of Fourteenth street and Capitol avenue.  The commission will occupy three rooms on the second floor, facing both streets, for which it will pay $30 per month.</p>
                            <p>An assistant secretary was then selected.  For this position there were a number of candidates and the members of the commission were buttonholed on all sides by these

                            candidates and their friends before the meeting commenced.  W. H. Deering of Plattsmouth, a member of the state senate from Cass county, was the lucky man and was elected after the salary had been fixed at $75 per month.</p>
                            <p>The next business was the election of a bookkeeper, and Dan Althea of Beatrice was selected, after the salary had been fixed at $60 per month.</p>
                            <p>The selection of a stenographer was the rock upon which the commission split.  There was a decided difference of opinion as to whether the stenographer should be a man or a woman.  It was decided to fix the salary at $40 per month.  After a long discussion it was the opinion of five members of the commission that the selection of the stenographer should be left to Mr. Boydston.</p>
                            <p>The commission lost no time in declaring itself on the labor question.  The law making the appropriation for state participation in the exposition provides that unskilled labor shall be paid at the rate of $1.50 per day, and the members of the commission decided to adopt the scale for skilled mechanics fixed by the Omaha labor unions as a guide in regulated the wages to be paid skilled labor by the commission.</p>
                            <p>It has been practically conceded from the beginning that the state commission would distribute the several exhibits made under its direction in the several buildings erected by the exposition management, paying for the space in these buildings rather than to undertake to erect a separate state building for the housing of all kinds of exhibits.  It has also been determined to erect a building to be used as headquarters for people of the state to congregate, and which shall be known as the Nebraska building.  The general understanding has been that this building shall cost in the neighborhood of $15,000.</p>
                            <p>In accordance with this idea a number of architects in Omaha and at other points in the state submitted sketches for such a building.  These were examined by the commission, but no action was taken.  The commission is in no hurry about selecting a plan for this building, and will exercise great caution in selecting a design that will entitle the state building to a desirable location on the grounds.</p>

                            <p>The members of the commission held a consultation with the architects-in-chief of the exposition this morning regarding the location of the proposed state building.  The commissioners were strongly in favor of having the state building given a desirable location on the bluff tract, the piece of land lying along the edge of the bluff east of Sherman avenue and commanding a beautiful view of the broad valley of the Missouri for miles above and below the exposition grounds.  This portion of the grounds is to be parked and is to be used as a resting place and pleasure resort.</p>
                            <p>The Horticultural building will be located on the lower portion of this tract and the Plaisance will occupy the upper end of it.  It has been suggested that all of the state buildings be located on this tract, but some of the sites suggested are more desirable than others and the Nebraska commission is anxious that the building to be erected by it shall be given a good location.  The commissioners favor a site on the main avenue running north and south at a point about half way between the Horticultural building and the viaduct leading across Sherman avenue from the main court.  The plan of the grounds, as at present outlined, contemplates the erection of two buildings at this point, one on each side of the main entrance, facing each other.  The location has not yet been assigned to any building.  The Nebraska commissioners contemplate making overtures to the state commissions of other states with a view of having one of them agree to erect one of these two buildings, so that they may be designed along harmonious lines and present an attractive appearance.  It was suggested by some of the commissioners that the Illinois commission might be induced to expend a portion of its appropriation in this manner or that the Iowa commission might look with favor upon the idea.</p>
                            <p>The state commission <choice><sic>willl</sic><corr>will</corr></choice> meet the executive committee of the exposition tomorrow and this matter of locating the state building will form one of the subjects for consideration.</p>

                            <p>The commission convened at 1:30 p. m., at its headquarters at the Dellone.  The three rooms selected as offices had been supplied with furniture purchased by the commission this morning, comprising desks, chairs and tables and a neat pattern of oil cloth on the floor.</p>
                            <p>All members of the commission were present, Assistant Secretary Deering and Bookkeeper Althen were at their desks and the offices presented a busy appearance.</p>
                            <p>As soon as the commission convened a delegation from the Nebraska Poultry association appeared to ask for a portion of the state appropriation for a poultry exhibit.  The association was represented by President W. H. Havens of Fremont and W. C. Adkins, E. J. Richards, Thomas Foster and Major G. T. Croft of Omaha.  President Havens acted as the spokesman of the delegation, and asked the commission to expend $5,000 in promoting a poultry exhibit.  He called the attention of the commission to the fact that Nebraska is the foremost state in the union in the poultry business, and said the time had passed when the state looked to the east for fine birds.  He said the poultry shows held in this state during recent years had demonstrated that the finest birds in the United States were bred in Nebraska, and he expressed the opinion that the poultry exhibit at the exposition should be made larger than any exhibit ever held in this section.</p>
                            <p>The subject was generally discussed by the members of the commission and the delegation of poultrymen, but no action was taken.</p>
                            <p>The State Board of Agriculture will meet in this city tomorrow and will hold a consultation with the commission regarding the state exhibits of agriculture and kindred industries.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The members of the Nebraska Exposition commission held a consultation with the architects-in-chief of the exposition yesterday regarding the location of the proposed state building.  The commissioners were strongly in favor of having the state building given a desirable location on the bluff tract, the piece of land lying along the edge of the bluff east of Sherman avenue and commanding a beautiful view of the broad valley of the Missouri for miles above and below the exposition grounds.  This portion of the grounds is to be parked and is to be used as a resting place and pleasure resort.</p>
                            <p>The Horticultural building will be located on the lower portion of this tract and the Plaisance will occupy the upper end of it.  It has been suggested that all of the state buildings be located on this tract, but some of the sites suggested are more desirable than others and the Nebraska commission is anxious that the building to be erected by it shall be given a good location.  The commissioners favor a site on the main avenue running north and south at a point about half way between the Horticultural building and the viaduct leading across Sherman avenue from the main court.  The plan of the grounds, as at present outlined, contemplates the erection of two buildings at this point, one on each side of the main entrance, facing each other.  The location is the most desirable on the grounds and has not yet been assigned to any building.  The Nebraska commissioners contemplate making overtures to the state commissions of other states with a view of having one of them agree to erect one of these two buildings, so that they may be designed along harmonious lines and present an attractive appearance.  It was suggested by some of the commissioners that the Illinois commission might be induced to expend a portion of its appropriation in this manner or that the Iowa commission might look with favor upon the idea.</p>
                            <p>The state commission will meet the executive committee of the exposition today and this matter of locating the state building will form one of the subjects for consideration.</p>

                            <p>The commission convened at 1:30 p. m., at its headquarters at the Dellone.  The three rooms selected as offices had been supplied with furniture purchased by the commission yesterday, comprising desks, chairs and tables and a neat pattern of oil cloth on the floor.</p>
                            <p>All members of the commission were present, Assistant Secretary Deering and Bookkeeper Althern were at their desks and the offices presented a busy appearance.</p>
                            <p>As soon as the commission convened at delegation from the Nebraska Poultry association appeared to ask for a portion of the state appropriation for a poultry exhibit.  The association was represented by President W. H. Havens of Fremont and W. C. Adkins, E. J. Richards Thomas Foster and Major G. T. Croft of Omaha.  President Havens acted as the spokesman of the delegation, and asked the commission to expend $5,000 in promoting a poultry exhibit.  He called the attention of the commission to the fact that Nebraska is the foremost state in the union in the poultry business, and said the time had passed when the state looked to the east for fine birds.  He said the poultry shows held in this state during recent years had demonstrated that the finest birds in the United States were bred in Nebraska, and he expressed the opinion that the poultry exhibit at the exposition should be made larger than any exhibit ever held in this section.</p>
                            <p>The subject was generally discussed by the members of the commission and the delegation of poultrymen, but no action was taken.</p>
                            <p>Miss Nellie O'Rourke was chosen as stenographer for the commission.  Miss O'Rourke is a resident of Omaha and is a niece of the late Patrick Gilmore, the noted band leader.  She was chosen from among a large number of applicants.</p>
                            <p>On motion of Mr. Poynter the secretary was instructed to notify all state associations which desire to make exhibits at the exposition to submit estimates to the commission at its next meeting of the amount of space each association will require for its exhibit.  These estimates will be tabulated and the commission will then be able to form some idea of the demands which will be made upon it.</p>

                            <p>The time for the regular meetings of the commission will be the second and fourth Tuesdays of each month at 4 p. m.  The offices of the commission will be open at all times and during the interval between meeting the commission will be represented by Secretary Deering.</p>
                            <p>The consideration of plans for a state building occupied the time of the commission during the greater part of the afternoon yesterday.  Plans were submitted by a number of local architects and by others from out in the state.  These were discussed, but no decision was reached.  The members of the commission are anxious to settle upon the plans for building so that work may be commenced as soon as possible, and so that a cut of the building may be placed on the stationery of the commission.</p>
                            <p>Among the plans submitted yesterday was a set prepared by Architect Zander of Omaha.  His plans called for a building calculated to house all the exhibits to be made by the state.  It was 284x264 feet on the ground and eighty-five feet high.  He favored the idea of erecting a large building for state exhibits, but the members of the commission said it had been decided that the various exhibits to be made by Nebraska people should be placed where they would be in direct competition with exhibits from other states, and that the state building should be designed as a meeting place for visitors from the other states, and as a headquarters for the commission.  It was also to be used as headquarters for any state which did not desire to erect a separate building.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Zander asked for time to prepare a rough sketch in the line of the ideas suggested and was given until noon today.</p>
                            <p>The commission will adjourn at 3 o'clock this afternoon.</p>
                            <p>The State Board of Agriculture will meet in this city today and will hold a consultation with the commission regarding the state exhibits of agriculture and kindred industries.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Begin Work on Their Exhibit for the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>Last night the committee of Danes which has had in charge the matter of a Danish exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition, held a meeting at Washington hall and prepared the plan and arrangements for the display.</p>
                            <p>It was decided that the exhibit should be in the form of an old-fashioned Danish farmhouse, which is to be an exact reproduction of the country places that dotted and still dot the fatherland.  The front portion will be occupied with an inn.  Behind this is to be a stage upon which is to be enacted a typical Danish pantomime.  The purpose is to have the building of a national character such as will attract the Danish residents of the transmississippi section.</p>
                            <p>The exhibit is to be managed by a stock company, which will be incorporated under the laws of the state.  The capital stock will be $25,000, the shares being $5.  Some of the stock has already been subscribed.</p>
                            <p>At the next meeting of the board of directors of the exposition company a subcommittee consisting of S. Jonasen, Theodore Olsen and S. F. Neble will present the project.  A complete sketch of the proposed building will also be shown.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Council Bluffs People Turn Out To Show Their Interest.</head>
                            <head type="sub">PLAN FOR A PERMANENT ORGANIZATION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Need of a General House-Cleaning in the City, of Increased Motor Service, and of a Specific Exhibit Considered.</head>
                            <p>Nothing but the deep interest Council Bluffs people feel in the Transmississippi Exposition could have induced enough of the most active and pushing kind to attend a meeting that filled the red hot council chamber on such a sweltering night as last night.  The men who were responsible for calling the mass meeting to organize Council Bluffs for exposition work felt a little shaky about the time the meeting was to occur, for they realized that it would be much pleasanter for men who had spent the day in hot stores and offices to spend the evening in the coolness of their homes and verandas, and they were encouraged and gratified when the attendance became sufficient to well fill the room.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Carson was called to the chair and C. H. Judson was made secretary.  It was a free-for-all meeting and everybody had a chance to talk and make suggestions.  Dr. Cleaver spoke of the necessity of the people of Council Bluffs doing all that lay in their power to solve the transportation problem.  More than half of the visitors to the exposition would have to pass through Council Bluffs, and the present motor line with its present equipment would be sadly inadequate to afford transportation to the hundreds of thousands who would expect to use the electric cars between the two cities.  He thought the citizens should assist the Omaha and Council Bluffs Motor company in every way possible in providing a service that would be fully adequate to the demands.</p>
                            <p>Alderman Casper favored a specific and characteristic Council Bluffs exhibit, showing the wonderful productiveness of the soil of the hills that are covered with vineyards&#8212;in short a horticultural exhibit that would attract the attention it deserved.  He thought when more than one-half of the people of the city had no real idea of the present extent of the fruit industry around the city it was time to make a great exhibit for their own benefit as well as for the enlightenment of the world.</p>
                            <p>J. P. Hess favored this idea and at the same time suggested the necessity of giving the city a general housecleaning in preparation for the reception of the hundreds of thousands of visitors that would come here next year.  Council Bluffs, he declared, is one of the most beautiful of cities, but its appearance could be made a great deal more attractive if a sentiment could be created that would induce every property owner to repaint, repair and beautify his home and property.</p>
                            <p>H. W. Tilton spoke of the necessity of having a representation at the exposition that would be in the closest touch with the manufacturers who would come to the big show with their exhibits.  They should be shown something that would induce them to make an extra effort to secure western trade.</p>
                            <p>F. A. Bixby spoke of the necessity of a descriptive book and the organization of a literary bureau that could be the means of disseminating information vital to Council Bluffs and western Iowa.</p>
                            <p>Judge James said there was the greatest necessity for perfect harmony between the city and transportation companies.  All of the railroads should be asked and encouraged to do the utmost to attract visitors and make their journey to and from the city easy and pleasant.  The motor company in particular, he thought, needed every encouragement to make the effort necessary to meet the heavy demands that would be made upon it.  He believed that the exposition would be a greater affair than even the most sanguine Council Bluffs and Omaha people imagined it would, and there should be no other thought than that it is just as much a Council Bluffs enterprise as it is an Omaha affair.  He also insisted upon a general cleaning up of the town.</p>
                            <p>Prof. Sawyer thought if there was the proper concert of action on the part of the people Council Bluffs would be able to impress the exposition visitors with the idea that it was the best station on the air line to paradise.</p>
                            <p>Senator Pusey was much gratified by the report and suggestions he had heard, and thought such gatherings were of the utmost importance to the city as well as to the exposition.  He was in hearty accord with the exposition idea.  He believed it would do more for the farmers, manufacturers and the people of Iowa generally that it would for any other state in the union.  It would be of greater benefit to Iowa than it would be to Nebraska.  Exposition visitors could not ride through Iowa and not realize its wealth and its beauty and the fact that it was the banner agricultural state in the union.  He had abundantly satisfied himself that the exposition would be of vastly more benefit to the state than was the Chicago fair.  The majority of the people who visited the exposition would have to pass through Iowa, for the most of them would come from the east.  The people of Iowa were generally realizing this, and the sentiment favoring a great exhibit was rapidly <choice><sic>crystalizing</sic><corr>crystallizing</corr></choice> into a demand for an appropriation that would be sufficiently large to make a much better showing than we made at the Columbian exposition.  He explained the difficulties encountered in getting through the first preliminary appropriation of $10,000, and declared that he stood alone in the Iowa senate as the advocate of the Transmississippi Exposition, but since the governor had appointed the Transmississippi Exposition, but since the governor had appointed the Transmississippi commissioner the fires had been kindled all over the state and when he returned to the legislature next winter and advocated a liberal appropriation he expected to find members from all sections ready to say, "Come on Pusey, we will help you get a good round sum."  "I intend to do the best I can," said he, "to get as liberal an <choice><sic>apropriation</sic><corr>appropriation</corr></choice> as possible.  I do not think it advisable to ask for an extraordinarily large sum, but it must be large enough to be a proper measure of the importance of the exposition and the state.  This money will only be used for a state exhibit, for the benefit of all of Iowa, and be it ever so large it will still leave plenty for Council Bluffs to do."</p>
                            <p>Secretary Judson said that he had been in conference with many eastern manufacturers and had found them strongly desirous of getting back the western trade they had lost during the three years of hard times.  This will bring them to the exposition with their exhibits and induce them to make greater efforts even than were made at the Columbian fair.  Many of these manufacturers, especially in New England, are realizing the necessity and importance of establishing western factories to be able to meet the competition of western concerns whose products have practically driven their own goods out of the western markets.  He advocated a permanent organization and the appointment of at least three committees, one on finance, one on ways and means and the other on membership and general organization, all working for the exposition, committees that would coalesce all interests.</p>
                            <p>The secretary's suggestion was followed, and a committee of five was appointed to draft an outline and report at a meeting to be held in the council chamber tomorrow evening.  This committee was appointed by the chairman and consists of:  Prof. Sawyer, Dr. Cleaver, Judge James, Victor Bender and C. H. Judson.  The meeting then adjourned.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Members of the Commission Ask Architects to Submit Plans for a Structure that Will Be a Credit to the State.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission has decided to ask the architects of the state to submit plans for a state building at the next meeting of the commission, which will be held the second Tuesday in August.  This conclusion was reached after examining plans submitted by Craddock of Lincoln and Voss, Zander and Irwin of Omaha.  The members of the commission say plainly that they do not know what they want, except that the building must be a credit to the state, must harmonize with the other buildings of the exposition and must not cost over $16,000, including architects' fees, cost of superintending the construction, painting, finishing and everything else to complete the building ready for occupancy, but not including furniture, lighting, etc.</p>
                            <p>The discussion of this matter occupied the entire morning session of the board.  Chairman Neville and Commissioners Poynter and Whitford were in favor of deciding at once on a plan, that the preliminaries might be concluded before the next meeting of the board, and prompt action taken at the next meeting to commence the construction.  Commissioner Dutton insisted that the commission should proceed slowly and give the architects all over the state a chance to submit plans, if they desired to do so.  He said it would be unfair to architects in other parts of the state to take action at this meeting before an opportunity had been afforded them to make a proposition to the commission.</p>
                            <p>This argument finally prevailed and a motion was adopted providing that plans be received by the commission at its next regular meeting.  In this connection a resolution by Commissioner Poynter was also adopted, providing that the limit for the cost of the buildings should be fixed at $16,000.</p>
                            <p>A general discussion followed as to what details should be given the architects as to what the commission would require in the way of a building.  It was decided to leave the size and shape of the building to the architects, but it was stipulated that there must be provision for several offices of good size, ample toilet accommodations as will make the building a headquarters for Nebraskans and afford accommodations for the people of other states.  It was also agreed that the building must compare most favorably with the elaborate architectural creations which will be erected on the grounds by the exposition management.</p>

                            <p>The acceptance by the city council of the deeds conveying Kountze park to the city completes the transaction by which the city gets another public park, and enables the Board of Park Commissioners to assist the exposition management in preparing the ground for the exposition.  The new park, which will be known as Kountze park, contains eleven acres, not including the streets surrounding it, or Twentieth street, which passes through it from north to south.  It forms the center of what will be the main court of the exposition and the Board of Park Commissioners will assist in beautifying it to the extent of the funds at its disposal.  The board has set aside $30,000, which it will use for this purpose.</p>
                            <p>Among the improvements which will be made by the Board of Park Commissioners will be the bridges across the lagoon at Twentieth street, which will be permanent in their nature, it being the intention to retain the portion of the lagoon on the park tract as a permanent improvement.  The artesian well on the grounds will also be taken in charge by the board as a means of supplying the lake with fresh water.</p>
                            <p>The Arch of States, which will form the main entrance to the exposition, will be constructed across Twentieth street at the south side of Kountze park and this will be erected of permanent material by the Board of Park Commissioners.  After the exposition is over this beautiful arch will remain as a permanent entrance to the park and as a landmark which may be seen for miles.  It will be constructed of either terra cotta or of gray sandstone, while the coat-of-arms of <choice><sic>tbhe</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> states of the union will be in appropriate colors in the frieze, protected from the elements by superimposed arches.  The Board of Park Commissioners will also assist the exposition management in making any other improvements on this piece of ground, the only limitation being that the improvements shall be of a permanent nature.</p>

                            <p>Last night the committee of Danes which has had in charge the matter of a Danish exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition, held a meeting at Washington hall and prepared the plan and arrangements for the display.</p>
                            <p>It was decided that the exhibit should be in the form of an old-fashioned Danish farmhouse, which is to be an exact reproduction of the country places that dotted and still dot the fatherland.  The front portion will be occupied with an inn.  Behind this is to be a stage upon which is to be enacted a typical Danish pantomime.  The purpose is to have the building of a national character such as will attract the Danish residents of the transmississippi section.</p>
                            <p>The exhibit is to be managed by a stock

                            <p>At the next meeting of the board of directors of the Exposition association a subcommittee consisting of S. Jonasen, Theodore Olsen and S. F. Neble will present the project.  A complete sketch of the proposed building will also be shown.</p>

                            <p>Peregoy &amp; Moore of Council Bluffs have filed application with the Department of Exhibits for space for thirteen firms in the tobacco section.</p>
                            <p>I. N. Simpson, commercial agent for the iron trade, notified the Department of Exhibits from Des Moines that he would report next week with six applications from extensive manufacturers.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Concessions has an application for the privilege of operating a cyclorama on the exposition grounds.  The application is made by a firm which has a large number of these pictures, and the exposition is offered the choice of these five subjects:  The Battle of Gettysburg, Custer's Last Fight, the Battle of Lookout Mountain, the Battle of Waterloo and the fight between the Monitor and Merrimac.</p>
                            <p>J. T. Calvert, secretary and treasurer of the A. J. Root company of Medina, O., manufacturers of bee keepers' supplies, was a caller at exposition headquarters today.  Mr. Calvert is the guest of R. M. Lewis of this city, a bee keeper, and he stated to the exposition people that his firm was making elaborate preparations to make an exhibit at the exposition which will eclipse all former efforts in that direction.  He was greatly interested in the preparations which are being made for a large exhibit of bees and honey.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Details of the Structures that Will Contain the Products of the Mines and the Fruits of the Soil.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The perspective drawing for the Agriculture building has been issued from the office of the architects-in-chief of the exposition.  This building was designed by Cass Gilbert of St. Paul, Minn., and is a companion of the Mines building.  The Agriculture building will stand on the north side of the main court, west of the Administration building, while the Mines building will occupy a corresponding position on the east side of the Administration building.  Both are the same size, 400x140 feet, and have the same height of cornice, forty feet.</p>
                            <p>The Agriculture building is one of the most richly decorated structures on the grounds.  The architecture is of the Corinthian order, modified, as are all the main buildings, by the French renaissance.  The whole order is carried on a high base, the building being a rectangular mass with strong central motive and square pavilions at the ends.</p>
                            <p>The central pavilion is elaborately treated and is marked by an arched entrance, thirty-five feet in height, opening into a semi-circular vestibule having three high doors leading into the building.  The walls and the half dome of the vestibule are elaborately decorated in color.  The mouldings about the arch are formed of broad bands of fruit, cereals, etc.  Surmounting this central pavilion is a seated figure of "Agriculture," flanked by pairs of figures symbolizing plenty.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SCULPTURE IN ABUNDANCE.</head>
                            <p>The corner pavilions are surmounting by rich groups of sculpture symbolizing the different branches of agriculture.  Between the columns forming the main walls of the buildings are high arches over square-headed windows.  The space over these windows and beneath the arches are to be treated in rich color.</p>
                            <p>The scheme of both the sculptured and colored ornament of the building is designed to express the purpose to which the building is to be put.  The central ornaments in the frieze are heads of cattle, and garlands of fruits and flowers are used as chief ornaments in the frieze and over the centers of the arches.  The colors to be used in this decoration are the rich greens of foliage, corn color, the red of the poppy and the colors of fruit.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Gilbert has arranged for a large number of entrances to the Agricultural building.  Besides the central main entrance there is a large entrance in each of the corner pavilions.  There are also doors on the front side, half way between the center and ends, making five entrances at the front of the building, and the ends are equally well supplied with entrances, there being three in each end.</p>
                            <p>The perspective of the Mines building has also been completed by the architects-in-chief.  This building was designed by John J. Humphreys of Denver, and is a companion of the Agriculture building.  Like its mate, this building has a high central motive and strongly marked corner pavilions, each of the latter being surmounted by an octagonal dome.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE.</head>
                            <p>The architecture of the Mines building is of the Roman Doric order, with a suggestion of the French renaissance.  Between the central motive and the corner pavilions is a series of Doric columns with the entablature broken above them, carrying a rich balustrade.  Between the columns are large, arched windows filled with ornamental grill work.  The center and end pavilions carry high arched openings corresponding with those between the columns of the main walls.</p>
                            <p>The central pavilion is surrounded by a group of four large sculptured figures, representing, respectively, gold, silver, copper and iron, kneeling at the feet of a statue of heroic size, representing Commerce, to whom they are tendering their precious stores.  The corner pavilions are each surmounted by groups of statuary typifying the baser metals, tin, lead, etc., which are found in the transmississippi states.</p>
                            <p>The balustrade surmounting the main walls of the building carries, at intervals, tall masts, from which will fly pennants.  The bases of these masts are richly decorated.</p>
                            <p>Like the Agricultural building, the Mines building will be elaborately decorated with color, the tints used being those produced by the various metals in their many forms.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition held a meeting yesterday afternoon.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall reported that Charles Cleves, the architect appointed for the Dairy and Apiary buildings, had refused to accept the appointment before it was tendered to him and then changed his mind and said he would accept it.  Afterwards he changed his mind again and refused to have anything to do with it.  The committee then appointed another architect for each of the buildings in question.  F. A. Henninger was appointed to "do" the Dairy building and John McDonald will design the Apiary building.  Both of these men are Omaha architects.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles submitted a report on the disposition which should be made of the subjects of music, special attractions, entertainment and program for the exposition.  This matter was referred to the president several weeks ago, for the reason that the several matters did not seem to properly belong to any of the several departments of the executive committee.  The report of the president was adopted, placing the subjects as follows:  All music, fireworks and other attractions for the general entertainment of the exposition to be placed in charge of a bureau under the Ways and Means Department; special attractions, musical or otherwise, for which admission fees or privileges to produce an income will be charged, to be placed in charge of a bureau under the Department of Concessions; the entertainment of visitors and the general program of the exposition to be placed in charge of the president, subject to the approval of the executive committee.</p>

Omaha was represented at this meeting by T. J. Fitzmorris, G. M. Nattinger and D. H. Christie, who went prepared to capture the next convention.  This gathering is attended by about 100 delegates and is regarded as a most desirable gathering.</p>
                            <p>The news that Omaha had been decided upon as the next place of meeting was received with considerable satisfaction in this city.  While it was almost a foregone conclusion that the endorsement of Omaha at the meeting last year would decide the action of this meeting yet the fact that final action had been taken was regarded as most gratifying.</p>

                            <p>The regular weekly meeting of the executive committee of the exposition was held at the Committee club rooms yesterday afternoon.</p>
                            <p>The early part of the meeting was taken up with a consultation between the committee and A. H. Griffiths of Detroit, an applicant for the position of art director of the exposition.  Mr. Griffiths told the committee about himself, and spoke generally regarding his ideas of the best method of securing pictures and other works of art which would go to make a creditable art display.  Regarding remuneration Mr. Griffiths said he would want $4,000 for the entire period of his engagement and his expenses in the traveling which might be necessary in connection with the securing of pictures, etc.  He volunteered to subscribe for $1,500 of his salary for exposition stock.  He said it would be necessary to make a personal call upon artists and other owners of desirable works of art in order to secure them, as letters would never accomplish this result.  He estimated the probable expense of making a good art exhibit at about $18,000.</p>
                            <p>The matter of engaging Mr. Griffiths was deferred until the next regular meeting.</p>
                            <p>A report was read from the secretary of the Board of Lady Managers regarding the educational exhibit and individual competition which is being instituted by the board.  The secretary estimated that the income from this competition would be about $15,000 and said that the expense of promoting the scheme would be about $3,000.  The secretary also asked for information regarding working in Iowa.  She said that the Iowa members of the woman's board, Mrs. Reed and Mrs. Keyes of Council Bluffs, had been told by the vice-president of the exposition for Iowa, George F. Wright of Council Bluffs, that the Iowa Exposition commission would take entire charge of the educational exhibit of that state and that the woman's board should not operate in Iowa.</p>

                            <p>The members of the executive committee expressed the opinion that Mr. Wright was laboring under a wrong impression as to the plan of the woman's board and President Wattles was asked to write to him and explain the work the women are doing and show him that it does not conflict in any way with the work of the Iowa commission.</p>
                            <p>Manager Lindsey of the Department of Ways and Means reported that he had called upon the local officials of the Missouri Pacific and had asked that road to make a subscription to exposition stock in view of the fact that a contract is now under consideration by the executive committee giving that road exclusive rights upon the exposition grounds for their tracks.  Mr. Lindsey said he had been informed by Mr. Phillippi, general agent for the road, that if the completion of the contract hinged upon a subscription by his road the whole matter might as well be dropped.  Mr. Lindsey said he had also written to the officials of the road, asking that a promise made by Vice-President Gould early in the summer be made good, and asking for a subscription of $25,000.</p>
                            <p>In the absence of Manager Babcock of the Department of Transportation, the approval of the contract with the Missouri Pacific was laid over for future consideration.</p>
                            <p>Some little warmth has been engendered in certain places by the action of the Missouri Pacific regarding other roads entering the exposition grounds.  When the proposition to change the location from Miller park to the present location was under consideration the Missouri Pacific officials were very profuse in their promises to allow all
                            
                            <pb n="221" xml:id="TMISB02-221"/>
                            
                            other roads to cross its tracks in order to get into the grounds if they desired to do so.</p>

                            <head type="sub">HOLDING ITS MONOPOLY.</head>
                            <p>The Northwestern road was especially interested in this question, as it had things all its own way at Miller park, and the Missouri Pacific would have the "cinch" on the present site for the reason that its tracks circle the grounds and no other road could get in without its permission to cross its tracks.  After the change was made the Missouri Pacific refused to allow the Northwestern to cross its tracks and so shut it out completely.  Some of the exposition directors were decidedly provoked at this action in view of the fact that the Northwestern had subscribed $30,000 to the exposition, while the Missouri Pacific had not subscribed a cent.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion reported that the '98 Meet club of the wheelmen wanted the exposition management to contribute $5 toward the expense of sending a committee to the annual meeting of the League of American Wheelmen at Philadelphia to secure the next meeting of the league for Omaha.  After discussing the matter it was decided to give the club the free use of the race track at the old fair grounds for its race meet instead of giving any money.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater also reported on the result of a trip of E. C. Hunt, representing the Department of Publicity and Promotion, to Cheyenne.  He stated that the governor of Wyoming had manifested a general interest in the exposition and had immediately issued a proclamation to the county commissioners of each county in the state, requesting them to take action at once to collect suitable material for making a creditable exhibit of the resources of the state.  The governor had also promised to lay the matter before the next meeting of the state board, which corresponds to the Board of Public Lands and Buildings of Nebraska, with a view of appointing a state commission to see that the state is properly represented.  Wyoming still has the exhibit which was made by it at the World's fair, which cost the state between $30,000 and $40,000 to collect, and this will probably be utilized as a nucleus for an exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>

Crane, a representative of the office of the supervising architect of the Treasury department, is in the city in consultation with the architects-in-chief and officials of the exposition regarding the building to be erected at the Transmississippi Exposition by the United States government.  The designing of this building is in the direct charge of Mr. Crane, and his trip to Omaha is for the purpose of making a personal examination of the exposition grounds, and obtaining such other data in connection with the exposition as will better enable him to judge as to the character of the building which will best suit the situation.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Crane came directly from Washington, arriving this morning, and was taken in hand by Mr. Walker of the firm of Walker &amp; Kimball, architects-in-chief, an old friend of Mr. Crane.  A trip was made to the office of the Department of Publicity and Promotion, where the perspective drawings of the several main buildings were inspected in detail by Mr. Crane.  The exposition grounds were next visited, and the location assigned to the government building was pointed out by Mr. Walker and carefully looked over by Mr. Crane, who expressed the greatest satisfaction at the very excellent location which had been chosen for the federal building.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Crane informed a Bee representative before visiting the exposition grounds that he should remain in Omaha two or three days and would decided upon the main points of the Government building before leaving the city.  He said he could not say just what the design would be until he had inspected the proposed location and the drawings of the other buildings, as the desire of the supervising architect's office was to design a building which would be in harmony with the main buildings and which would would be an architectural credit to the government.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Will Spend Several Days Looking Over Exposition Ground and Examining Plans of Other Buildings to Be Erected.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>E. A. Crane, a representative of the office of the supervising architect of the Treasury department, is in the city in consultation with the architects-in-chief and officials of the exposition regarding the building to be erected at the Transmississippi Exposition by the United States government.  The designing of this building is in the direct charge of Mr. Crane, and his trip to Omaha is for the purpose of making a personal examination of the exposition grounds, and obtaining such other data in connection with the exposition as will better enable him to judge as to the character of the building which will best suit the situation.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Crane came directly from Washington, arriving yesterday, and was taken in hand by Mr. Walker of the firm of Walker &amp; Kimball, architects-in-chief, an old friend of Mr. Crane.  A trip was made to the office of the Department of Publicity and Promotion, where the perspective drawings of the several main buildings were inspected in detail by Mr. Crane.  The exposition grounds were next visited, and the location assigned to the government building was pointed out by Mr. Walker and carefully looked over by Mr. Crane, who expressed the greatest satisfaction at the very excellent location which had been chosen for the federal building.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">PLEASED WITH THE SITE.</head>
                            <p>After returning from his trip to the exposition grounds and the examination of the sketches of the buildings on the main court, Mr. Crane was decidedly enthusiastic over the opportunities offered the federal government to make a fine building and a display which would be highly creditable in every way.  The location assigned to the government building, at the western end of the lagoon and facing the gran court, was regarded by Mr. Crane as the most satisfactory location which had been given to the building of the general government at any exposition.</p>
                            <p>"While the supervising architect's office," said Mr. Crane, "has very little to say about what material shall constitute the exhibit to be made by the several departments of the government, yet the facilities we provide largely control the extent and general character of the exhibit.  After looking over your exposition grounds I can say without hesitation that our office will be able to provide accommodations and facilities for each of the government departments that will almost certainly result in making the government exhibit at Omaha superior to that made at any exposition which has been held.  The location of the building is all that could be desired.  It is a commanding position and will afford opportunity for architectural embellishment which we shall be more than pleased to utilize."</p>
                            <p>In reply to a question regarding the general design and plan of the government building, Mr. Crane referred to a rough sketch which he said had been hastily made as embodying the ideas which had formed in his mind as to what the government building would look like.  The sketch showed a building of imposing appearance, consisting of a rectangular central portion, 220x125 feet in size, with a cornice sixty feet in height, and with wings extending from either side, 150x125 feet in size, making the total length of the building 500 feet.  The cornice of the wings was shown to be forty-five feet above the ground.  The central portion was surmounted by an octagonal dome 164 feet in height to the base of the colossal figure standing at its apex, and sixty feet in diameter/  At each of the four corners of the central portion of the building were shown smaller circular domes.  A prominent feature of the central dome was a high drum surrounded by Corinthian columns.</p>
                            <p>The main entrance to the building was shown by a recessed portico with six massive columns.  Mr. Crane stated that the architecture would be of the Italian renaissance style and Corinthian order, giving ample opportunity for elaborate embellishment, which would be taken advantage of to the fullest extent.</p>
                            <p>The dimensions given for this building will result in a structure that will fill almost the entire western end of the main court.  Its height, as compared with the other main buildings, will be imposing in the extreme, and it will constitute one of the most striking features in the magnificent grand court where the greatest architectural effect will be concentrated.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">EXHIBIT LIFE SAVING WORK.</head>
                            <p>There were other features connected with the location of the government building which were highly pleasing to Mr. Crane.  One of these was the grand basin or mirror which will lie immediately in front of the building.  Mr. Crane stated that the life-saving service of the government was desirous of making an exhibit which would convey to the people some idea of the functions of that department of the government, but had not been provided in several recent exposition with the necessary place in which to give practical exhibitions of the work which it is doing.  The large basin would afford a fine opportunity for a display of the work of this department and Mr. Crane said that an exhibition would be given every afternoon of the work performed by the life-saving crews stationed all along the sea coast and the shores of the great lakes.  A boat house for the storage of the large life boat had been agreed upon by himself and Mr. Walker, Mr. Crane stated, and would be constructed at the south side of the grounds adjacent to the basin, and every afternoon this boat with a load of human freight would be overturned in the middle of the basin, the life line would be shot out from the shore and the crew rescued from the perils of the deep.</p>
                            <p>Another feature which could be provided for to better advantage than at other expositions, in Mr. Crane's opinion, was that of a camp for the soldiers who would be utilized as a feature of the military exhibit and as guards of the government building.  This camp will be located in the southwest corner of the grounds, where there is a most convenient plot of ground of the proper size for a camp of one company.  In the morning exhibition drills will be given on the parade ground of this company, and the routine of camp life will be open to the inspection of visitors.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles has received the reply of Governor Holcomb to a letter, asking that a proclamation be issued to the people of Nebraska, calling attention to the fact that the state of Nebraska is taking active steps to participate in the exposition and calling on the people to assist the exposition in every way.  The governor states that he will gladly co-operate with the exposition management in every possible way and will issue the proclamation at once, calling upon the people of the stat to give the exposition their most cordial support.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles suggested to the governor that a similar proclamation be issued to the governors of states of the union, outside of the transmississippi region, asking them to appoint commissioners to represent their respective states at the exposition.

                            <p>Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds said last night that he would soon shoot the artesian will at the exposition grounds, the nitro-glycerine having arrived.  The plan is to put a heavy charge of the explosive at the bottom of the well and then explode it with a wire attached to an electric battery.  It is thought that the exposition will open up the rock, thus forming a large chamber that will serve as a reservoir, adding great force to the flow of water.</p>

                            <p>The Board of Public Works has nearly completed the reconstruction of the Thirty-first street sewer at Dodge street and the excavation is now being refilled.  The city council was notified of the damaged condition of this sewer four years ago, but no action was taken and the sewer was allowed to deteriorate until a few weeks ago, when at the urgent solicitation of City Engineer Rosewater the long delayed order to repair it was given.  When the pipe was finally uncovered it was found it had become almost worthless.  One huge crack extended for nearly 100 feet and the entire upper half of the sewer was so badly shattered that it had to be reconstructed.  The entire cost of the job amounts to nearly $3,000.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The regular meeting of the Real Estate Exchange this afternoon was addressed by Manager Rosewater of the Bureau of Publicity and Promotion, who, in response to an invitation from the exchange, discussed several questions connected with real estate interests which were suggested in the invitation.  One of these related to the amount of advertising that Omaha had received through the Transmississippi Exposition.  Mr. Rosewater brought a huge stack of clippings and sketches which in itself was an effective answer to the question.  He briefly outlined the work that had been done by way of direct advertising and showed that the exposition had already received much more publicity than was given the World's fair at the same stage in its development.  The papers of the western and middle states had given all the space to the exposition that could reasonably be expected, and while the eastern cities were not so directly interested, the papers of Boston and other large eastern cities had been fairly liberal in their treatment of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Very <choice><sic>littue</sic><corr>little</corr></choice> effort had been made so far to secure illustrated articles on the exposition.  It was considered better policy to wait until the department had something to show that would create the best possible impression and from now on these illustrations would be made a feature.  The cuts of the Art, Machinery and Electricity buildings were now ready and were being sent out to the newspapers of Boston, New York, Philadelphia and all other large cities.</p>
                            <p>The Century Magazine had agreed to devote ten or twelve pages of its October number to an illustrated article on the exposition, and by the first of the year similar illustrations would have appeared in all the magazines and illustrated newspapers.</p>

                            <p>In reply to the query what the real estate interests of Omaha might expect during the next year Mr. Rosewater said that he was confident that there would be a material improvement in real estate values.  This would not all be due to the exposition.  The exposition was a stimulant and it had already attracted more attention to Omaha than any other enterprise that had ever been conceived here.  The best indication of a revival of prosperity was the revival of general business and the inquiries for farm lands.  It was assured that there would be a greater demand for Nebraska farm lands during the next year than there had been during the past ten years.  The prosperity of the agricultural territory tributary to Omaha and of the regions to the west could not fail to indirectly stimulate Omaha and aid in the revival of good times.  This location of the Armour packing plant was the turning point for Omaha.  The exposition would come when the tide was in our favor and for that reason there was no danger of a reaction like that which had been experienced at Atlanta and Chicago.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater alluded to the necessity for energetic work by the real estate men in advertising Omaha and suggested that they could accomplish much, both for the exposition and for themselves, by interesting themselves in the work of inducing nonresident property owners to subscribe to the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Erection of a Large Addition is Contemplated.</head>
                            <p>During the past two or three days architects and engineers have been working in the vicinity of the Swift and Company packing house at South Omaha, and it was learned from Manager E. C. Price this morning that extensive improvements and an enlargement of the plant are under serious consideration.  Plans are being made for a large addition to the plant, the expenditure for which will amount to nearly $250,000.</p>
                            <p>According to Mr. Price, the company has been hampered for some time by the large increase in business and the absolute necessity for spreading out has been recognized.  He said it had not been definitely determined whether the addition would be constructed this fall or early in the spring, but it was practically settled that an increase in the capacity of the plant would be made.  In addition to this expansion, Mr. Price said: "A number of improvements will be made at once in the plant in the way of adding the latest improved appliances for conducting the business.  Among other things, the cold storage room will be fitted up with vestibules which may be extended to the doors of the refrigerator cars which are to be loaded, thus keeping the temperature of the cold storage room and the car at the lowest point without admitting the warm air from the outside.  Other equally modern inventions will be utilized in making the plant perfect and increasing its capacity as much as possible pending the settlement of the plans for enlarging."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Explosion of the Dynamic Cartridge Sends Out a Flood of Water&#8212;Flow Shut Off by Obstructions in the Pipe.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>A successful attempt was made today in shooting the artesian well on the exposition grounds, and the flow was very materially increased.  Nearly three hours were consumed in making the preparations and it was nearly 2 o'clock when the dynamite at the bottom of the well was exploded.  The services of an expert electrician were secured and okonite wire was used as the conductor for the electric current which was to explode the acid explosive in the fuse, which was imbedded in the cartridge of dynamite.  Two lengths of this wire, each 1,100 feet in length, were secured by splicing shorter lengths together.  Insulating tape and way were used to make these splices, but Electrician Pierson expressed serious doubts about the splices withstanding the water pressure of 450 pounds to the square inch which existed at the lower part of the well.  The wire was tested after the splices had been made and was found to work all right on the ground.  The connection with the smaller of the two dynamite cartridges was made and then the two long, galvanized tubes, each filled with about seventy-five pounds of dynamite, were carefully lifted and tied to a rope.  A heavy weight of iron was fastened to the bottom of this combination and then the journey to the bottom of the well was commenced.  It was nearly fifteen minutes before the bottom of the well was reached and then the ends of the insulated wire were attached to a small hand dynamo used for firing blasts.</p>

                            <p>While these preparations were being made the men and boys who lounge about the exposition grounds insisted on crowding about the mouth of the well where the dangerous explosive was being prepared.  They were driven away time after time, but paid no attention to the warning of danger.  When all was ready Superintendent Geraldine volunteered to "touch it off" and the others retired to a safe distance to watch the result.  Several times the dynamo was worked, but with no apparent effect on the well.  Electrician Pierson said the battery was not strong enough to force a current through the wire on account of the water leaking into the splices.  He proposed that the street car trolley wire be "tapped" or that an arc light wire be reached in some way so as to get a heavier current.  The latter suggestion was adopted and an arc wire was found in the immediate vicinity of the grounds.</p>
                            <p>When connection was made with this heavy current the first indication of that fact was a column of water twenty feet in height which shot up into the air like an immense waterspout.  There was a general shouting on the part of the small boys and men and a rush for the mouth of the well.</p>
                            <p>After the first rush of water there was a temporary lull and then there appeared to be  steady flow which forced the water to a height of about three feet above the mouth of the pipe.  This flow stopped in a few moments, but those employed about the well said this was caused by the fact that the strong pressure of the water had pushed the heavy rope up in a bunch, forming a plug which had entirely stopped the flow.  As there was over 1,000 feet of two-inch rope in the well, this theory seemed very plausible.  The engine was at once started up and the work of pulling up the rope as commenced.  The well drillers were quite confident that when all obstructions had been removed that there would be a fine flow of water.</p>

                            <p>In response to a general call issued to the Swedish-American residents of Omaha a meeting was held in the Chamber of Commerce last evening, which drew out an attendance of about 150.  The meeting was called to take action with reference to the Transmississippi Exposition, to organize an association which would properly represent the Swedish people at the great show by an exhibit.  C. O. Lobeck was appointed temporary chairman, with Albert G. Linden as secretary.  President G. W. Wattles, representing the board of directors of the exposition, gave a short address, in which he proffered the assistance of the exposition managers toward any effort which might be made by the Swedes in placing an exhibit.  He also stated that it was probable that a day or week would be set aside by the management of the exposition to be devoted to the Swedish visitors.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles was followed by Prof. P. M. Lindberg of Augustana college, Rock Island, who spoke along the same lines in the mother tongue.  At the conclusion of his remarks numerous suggestions were made by those present as to the manner of organizing a society and the question of whether women should be placed among the officials was brought up.  The suggestion was turned down and the meeting proceeded to ballot for officers.  C. O. Lobeck was elected president, with John S. Helgren secretary.  The society is to be known as the Swedish Transmississippi association, the capital stock of which has not yet been decided upon.  It was also suggested that the Norwegian people of Omaha be invited to co-operate in the scheme and that a call to this effect be issued by the secretary.  The board of directors of the new society will be elected at the next meeting.  The session adjourned subject to the call of the president.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Shooting the Bottom of the Hole Fails to Materially Increase the Flow of Water at the Top of the Pipe.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>As a source of supply for the lagoon, the artesian well on the exposition grounds is a failure.  Such is the opinion of experts who have viewed the well since it has been "shot" and cleaned out.  Persons who have seen the well and who are qualified to estimate, give the opinion that the flow is not over thirty gallons per minute or 43,200 gallons per day.</p>
                            <p>The rope was hauled up yesterday afternoon and it was found that the water was quite dirty.  This was attributed to a caving in of the earth below the iron casing which extends to a point about 900 feet below the surface.  The well was cleaned out last night and was flowing uninterruptedly this morning, the water still being a little roily, but having an agreeable taste.  The iron casing has yet to be extended to the bottom of the well and this may increase the flow somewhat, but is not expected to increase it materially.</p>
                            <p>There is some talk of shooting one of the upper layers of sandstone with the hope of thereby increasing the amount of water.  Until this is determined the casing will not be extended any further down.  There is also a suggestion to use an air lift for assisting the water to make its escape from the well.  It is regarded as among the possibilities to increase the quantity of water several times, depending upon the depth to which the pipe carrying the compressed air is extended.  It may be possible by this means to increase the flow to 100 gallons per minute, or 144,000 gallons per day.  Even if this were done a number of wells would be required to overcome the evaporation and seepage in the lagoon, to say nothing of the amount of water which would be required to fill the lagoon at the start.</p>

                            <head type="sub">BECOMES A LIVE QUESTION.</head>
                            <p>The water question has been the subject of much serious consideration at the hands of the exposition executive committee.  Overtures have been made to the Omaha Water company to induce that company to either donate water or furnish it at a low rate.  The reply has been made that to supply the exposition with the immense amount of water it will require every day while the gates are open will necessitate the putting in of an additional pump and laying extra mains.  The water company says it will not spend any more money on its plant until the status is determined by the courts.  It virtually says to the exposition management, "Help us clear our title to a franchise in Omaha, and we will furnish you with water for the exposition at a low rate."</p>
                            <p>The executive committee passed a resolution requesting Judge Munger to act upon the case now pending before him in which the franchise of the water company is involved.</p>
                            <p>Pending the settlement of this question, the water company has given the exposition management permission to attach a hose to one of its hydrants for the purpose of getting water on the grounds for building purposes.</p>
                            <p>With matters in this condition, the executive committee is in a quandary as to the best method to pursue.  The question of water supply is a vital one and no solution is in sight.  It will be necessary to lay the water mains for the exposition before the preparation of the ground has progressed any further.  The source of supply will determine the size and character of the water mains to a considerable extent and this is just the point over which the executive committee is now cogitating.  Cut-off lake has been suggested as a source of supply for the lagoon, but the owners of property along the lake have not given any indication of receding from their attitude of refusing to allow the lake to be tapped and there the <unclear reason="torn"/></p>

                            <p>The adjourned meeting to perfect the organization of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi Exposition association called out a large attendance last evening.  There was considerable interest apparent in the work of selecting the big executive committee that will have the directing management of the association.  This interest assumed the form of a strong personal feeling on the part of some of the gentlemen present and there was a good deal of wrangling as to the methods to be followed in selecting the members of the committee.</p>
                            <p>The original committee of five, which was instructed at the previous meeting, to pave the way for a solution of the problem of getting an executive committee of fifty members, presented a list of 100 names and recommended that the meeting select another list of 100.  This suggestion was followed, and the names were selected and written upon a large sheet of paper posted on the wall.  It required some more time, and a confusing number of motions and amendments before a plan was decided upon.  It was then agreed that the meeting vote for fives sets of names of ten each, to be selected from the 200 suggested.  The ballot was secret, and it required a long time to do the voting.  The ballot for the first ten showed the several hundred names had been presented and voted upon, and that just one hour had been devoted to the work.  This put a decided damper upon the ardor of the gentlemen present, who desired to secure a place upon the committee, and a motion to reconsider and choose another plan was made and carried.  It was decided that the first ten elected should constitute a committee to choose the remaining forty, with instructions that they select men representing the greatest number of important industries and interests and report the names selected through the newspapers.  The result of the ballot showed that the ten elected were F. A. Bixby, Dr. J. H. Cleaver, I. M. Treynor, William Moore, W. A. Maurer, Victor E. Bender, O. P. Wickham, J. A. Herald, J. P. Greenshields and Mayor Carson.  There were really but nine elected, a half dozen of the men getting the same number of votes.  These were all thrown into a hat and Mayor Carson's name was drawn.  The meeting then adjourned without fixing a date for another session.</p>

                            <p>The general tenor of the letters received by the Nebraska commission is to the effect that the various counties are making preparations to make extensive exhibits at the approaching state fair and will gladly turn over to the commission, at the close of the fair, any material that may be desired.  Almost without exception, the letters indicate that deep interest is being taken in the matter by the people of all the counties in the state.  Some of the writers ask pertinent questions regarding premiums, etc., and the rules which will govern the arrangement of exhibits.

                            <head type="sub">NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF AN INCREASED FLOW</head>
                            <head type="sub">Question of Filling the Lagoon is One that is Now Agitating the Officers of the Exposition.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The artesian well on the exposition grounds was "shot" again last night.  Ninety pounds of dynamite were used and this charge was exploded in the middle one of the three strata of sandstone in which the water is found.  The effect of the explosion was to tear away large quantities of sandstone which completely choked the well below the point where the explosion took place and reduced the flow somewhat.  The drill was started last night and a large quantity of this sandstone was drilled out.  The drill was working about forty feet above the bottom of the well this morning.</p>
                            <p>Whether the debris in the well extends to the bottom or whether it is only a few feet in thickness remains to be seen.  There is no indication that the last shot increased the flow to any considerable extent.  The advisability of shooting the upper stratum of sandstone is now being considered by the Department of Buildings and Grounds.  If it is decided to not waste any more dynamite, the iron casing will be extended to the bottom of the well and the exact amount of the flow may then be determined.  Up to this time the well has cost between $5,000 and $6,000.</p>
                            <p>Persons visiting the grounds expect to see the water flowing from the well into the lagoon and are greatly mystified to see that the large pipe extending from the mouth of the well to the edge of the lagoon is perfectly dry.  As a matter of fact the water is turned into a ditch leading to a sewer.</p>
                            <p>The question of a water supply for the exposition continues to be a very vital issue with the exposition management.  While the immediate demand for water for building purposes has been bridged over by the action of the Omaha Water company in allowing a fire hydrant to be opened and water conducted through a hose to any part of the grounds, yet the question of supply for the buildings and lagoons is in a most unsatisfactory condition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">TIED UP IN COURT.</head>
                            <p>President Wattles this morning said: "The Omaha Water company people tell us that they are ready and willing to supply us, but that they have not enough water to do so and cannot supply it without enlarging their plant; this they say they would not be warranted in doing in the present unsettled condition of their relations with the city.  I think they are perfectly correct in their position.  No business man would be warranted in putting more money into his business when he didn't know whether he could continue doing business or would be forced to cease operations entirely within a short time.  Until the suit now pending in the courts between the water company and the city is settled one way or the other, the company cannot be expected to expend any more money in increasing its plant.  The officers of the company have made us a very liberal proposition covering our immediate needs, but they are not in a position to enter into any agreement that will cover the entire water supply of the exposition.  The lagoon on the grounds will require about 11,000,000 gallons of water to fill it, not allowing for seepage or evaporation.  Both of these items are considerable, so that a much larger amount of water will be required to fill the lagoon to start with and it is impossible to compute what amount will be required to keep the lagoon filled and keep the water from becoming stagnant.  With its present plant the water company cannot possibly supply this amount of water.  It would be a physical impossibility to do so without increasing its pumping capacity and the capacity of its mains.  To do this would require a large expenditure of money and this brings us right back to the starting point."</p>

                            <p>The case involving the franchise of the Omaha Water company is pending in the federal court, and Judge Munger decided this morning that he would take it up for hearing early in September, and said he would pass upon it, as between the city and the water company, by September 10, reserving his decision as to the rights of C. H. Venner until the latter's attorney could be heard in the matter.</p>

                            <p>This is the case in which the city seeks to have the franchise of the American Water Works company declared forfeited and asks the court to decide that the Omaha Water company has no legal claim upon the franchise of the old company.</p>
                            <p>At the time this suit was instituted the officials of the Omaha Water company had announced their determination to expend $500,000 in improving the plant and putting in an extra main from the Florence pumping station to Omaha, installing yet another large pump and making other improvements.  Since the suit was commenced the officials have expressed their readiness to carry out these plans whenever the legality of their franchise is established by the courts.</p>
                            <p>If the case is passed upon at the time indicated by Judge Munger, the work of increasing the capacity of the plant sufficiently to supply the exposition could undoubtedly be prosecuted until late in the winter and be resumed early enough in the spring to insure its completion before the exposition opens.</p>
                            <p>In the opinion of some of the members of the exposition executive committee the only solution management to proceed to lay water mains on the grounds, following the street lines, and connect these pipes with the water company' mains after Judge Munger's decision is rendered.  Members of the executive committee who support this idea say that the decision of the court will vest the title to the franchise in some body corporate and negotiations can be opened with this body, but that it is impossible to delay the work of laying the mains until after the case is decided.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Obstructions Being Removed from New Postoffice Site.</head>
                            <p>Lorenz Koenig of this city has been awarded the contract for tearing down and removing the building at the corner of Seventeenth street and Capitol avenue, which has been used as an office by the superintendent of the new postoffice building.  Mr. Koenig bid $91.50 for the material, he being required to remove it from the place.  He has thirty days in which to do the work.  One of the rooms of the first floor of the new building will be fitted up for an office for the superintendent, pending the completion of the building.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Latenser says that before the close of this month the fence, trees and other obstructions on the postoffice block will be removed, and the work of improving the place <choice><sic>commmenced</sic><corr>commenced</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>The detailed plans for the glass mosaic work for the ceiling of the main entrance to the new postoffice building on Sixteenth street show a very handsome piece of work.  The seals of the Postoffice, Treasure, Justice and Interior departments will be worked in this glass mosaic.  There will also be a large eagle worked in the central dome.</p>
                            <p>Al Shuster of Bloomfield has been arrested by government officials, charged with selling liquor to Indians.  The particular Indian to which he is alleged to have sold the liquor was Joseph Taylor.  While battling with the effects of the firewater, Mr. Taylor reclined upon a convenient railroad track, and with the aid of a passing train, his spirit was wafted to the happy hunting grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Efforts to Make a Military Display at Nashville Exposition.</head>
                            <p>The Military department of the Tennessee Centennial Exposition is endeavoring to arouse interest among the companies of the Nebraska national guard in the movement to secure a large attendance of the Nebraska militia at the Nashville Exposition on Nebraska day.  Circulars have been sent out to commanders of companies and regiments and to Adjutant General Barry.  These circulars state that a camp ground has been established within the exposition grounds and supplied with filtered drinking water, shower baths, bathing houses, floored tents, electric lights and bed sacks filled with straw, all these luxuries being furnished by the exposition management without expense to soldiers.  The circular also states that meals will be furnished for 50 cents per day to each man.  The only additional charge to be made is a single admission fee of 50 cents.</p>
                            <p>One of these circulars was sent to Adjutant General Barry, with the request that he endeavor to arouse as much enthusiasm as possible among the members of the Nebraska militia with a view to securing a large attendance of Nebraska troops on Nebraska day.  To this request the adjutant general replied that no appropriation was made by the legislature for such expense and any expense of that kind must be borne by private individuals.</p>
                            <p>The adjutant general then turned this correspondence over to the Department of Publicity and Promotion of the Transmississippi Exposition, and it will be laid before the executive committee.</p>

                            <p>Although it will be more than nine months before the gates of the Transmississippi Exposition will be thrown open to the public, the capacity of some of the buildings promises to be taxed to the utmost to give space for the applicants who have already asked for space.  This is especially true of the Manufacturers building.  Applications for space aggregating more than the total floor space of this building have already been filed with the Department of Exhibits and Superintendent Hardt announced this morning that fully one-third of the applications would have to be thrown out.  He said the greatest care would be exercised in selecting the exhibits which will be given space, in order that the Manufactures building may present only such exhibits as are strictly first class in every respect.</p>
                            <p>The great influx of applications for space in the Manufacturers building is not confined alone to domestic manufacturers, but the foreign firms are coming in at a rapid rate with applications for large sections of space.  Superintendent Hardt has recommended to the executive committee that a separate building be erected for these foreign exhibits, but no section has yet been taken on his suggestion.</p>

Mr. Cartwright secured forty-two applications for space from the leather firms in the country, the space applied for aggregating about 4,000 square feet.  Of these applications twenty were filed this morning and the rest will be filed within the next few days.  Those filed this morning were:  Green-Wheeler Shoe company of Fort Dodge, Ia.; Stern-Auer company, Cincinnati, O.; E. P. Reed &amp; Co, Rochester, N.

                            <head type="sub">Election of Permanent Officers Will Be Held Next Thursday.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi Exposition association met in the council chamber at Council Bluffs last evening and took a few more steps toward permanent organization.  Only twenty-one of the committee of fifty were present and but little more than general discussion and suggestion was accomplished, as it was felt that the election of permanent officers should not take place without a full attendance.  Secretary Judson followed instructions and sent a notification letter which gave the members who were notified of their selection to the executive committee a chance to stay away and let their absence signify their acceptance.  Judge W. C. James was called to the chair.  E. H. Walters requested to be excused from serving, but as it was desired to secure just such men as he, his resignation was not accepted, and by a unanimous vote he was retained.  A committee of ten was appointed on permanent organization, with instructions to report the names most suitable for permanent officers at the first regular meeting of the committee on next Thursday evening: Dr. J. H. Cleaver, V. E. Bender, E. F. Test, E. W. Hart, M. F. Rohrer, S. B. Wadsworth, E. H. Walters, A. C. Graham and Dr. Barstow were named by the chairman as this committee.</p>
                            <p>The secretary was instructed to again notify each member of the executive committee of his election and enclose a blank letter of acceptance and declination, which must be returned to him at once with one of the blanks filled out.  The secretary was instructed to meet the committee of ten at the office of Dr. Cleaver on Wednesday morning at 10 o'clock and report the number of replies received.  Those who neglect to respond by that time will be dropped and others substituted in their places on the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Judson stated that a great deal of correspondence was passing between the other commercial associations and the Iowa congressmen relative to the mobilization of the National Guard at Council Bluffs next year, and that with perhaps one exception all of the Iowa members were willing to do all they could to push along the scheme.  It will be a part of the duties of the solicitation committee to take up this work and assist in the effort.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Greenshields offered the following resolution:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha promises to be the greatest exhibit of the resources, civilization and intelligence of the west that has even been made, and as Iowa is one of the largest and wealthiest of the Transmississippi states, our people all over the state having a vital interest in the exposition, we believe it is of the most vital importance that the representative men of Iowa should be assembled in Council Bluffs during the time it is open; therefore,</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That we hereby request the delegates of Pottawattamie county to use every effort to secure the assembling of the next republican state convention in this city, and we urge them, if possible, to consult with their fellow delegates throughout the state during the session of the republican convention at Cedar Rapids for the purpose of securing their co-operation in bringing the republican state convention here in the summer of 1898.</p>
                            <p>The resolution was adopted and a committee was appointed to present it to the delegates of the county convention.  The committee adjourned until next Thursday evening, when the election of officers will take place.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Publicity and Promotion was seriously inconvenienced by the fire at the plant of the Rees Printing company.  The printing of 15,000 illustrated pamphlets had just been completed and they were to have been delivered to the department today.  These were all destroyed by the flames and water and none of them can be used.  The type forms, however, were uninjured, with the exception that the cuts of the buildings were badly warped.  New cuts were put in the forms and they were taken to a neighboring establishment and the work of printing the pamphlets was resumed.  The loss will make it impossible for the Department of Publicity and Promotion to supply the demand for these pamphlets for a few days.</p>

                            <p>The fireproof material for the construction of the Art building has been decided upon.  The frame work of the building will be of wood, the same as the other buildings, but this wood will be entirely covered, inside and out, with a fireproof material somewhat similar in outward appearance to staff.  This will be moulded in large sheets and will be handled much the same as large boards.  The spaces between the inner and outer walls will be filled with other fireproof material, covering the wood on every side and making solid walls which will be perfectly fireproof.  This material is of such a character is may be handled in cold weather as well as when the weather is warm.</p>

                            <p>The Battle Creek Food company of Battle Creek, Mich., has applied for twelve spaces at different points on the grounds for exhibiting its food products, each space to be 6x4 feet, and one additional space of 20x20 feet.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Exhibits has received a request from the firm of Armour &amp; Company, asking it to reserve 2,000 feet of space for that firm until the return of Mr. Armour from Europe.  The writer states that Mr. Armour will decide whether the exhibit to be made by the company shall be in one of the main buildings or in a separate pavillion.</p>

                            <p>The regular weekly meeting of the executive committee of the exposition was held yesterday afternoon at the Commercial club rooms.  The most important business transacted was the appointment of an art director for the exposition.  A. H. Griffiths, the present director of the Art <choice><sic>musium</sic><corr>museum</corr></choice> of Detroit, Mich., was appointed to this position, the appointment to take effect at once.  Mr. Griffiths will immediately take up the work of securing desirable pictures and other works of art for the Art building and will visit Europe this fall for that purpose, calling personally upon artists and owners of well known pictures and soliciting them to allow their pictures to be exhibited at Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The Exhibitors' agency submitted a bond for the approval of the executive committee.  This is an association of local business men, formed for the purpose of looking after the interests of the exhibitors at the exposition whose exhibit may be so small that they would not be warranted in incurring large expense in looking after it.  The association referred to proposes to take full charge of this class of exhibits, securing space, installing the exhibit, caring for it during the exposition and returning it to the exhibitor. In order to secure semi-official recognition, the bond referred to was given to the executive committee, insuring the responsibility of the association.</p>

                            <p>The letter of Adjutant General Barry, referring to the sending of companies of the Nebraska militia to the Tennessee exposition on Nebraska day, October 7, was presented by Manager Rosewater and was placed on file for future reference, for the reason that the exposition management has no money to expend in sending Nebraska troops to Nashville.</p>

This house will be fitted up as a hospital in the near future in order that it may be available in case of any accident occurring on the grounds during the construction period.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kinkendall reported that the plans for the Machinery building will be ready today for asking for bids for the construction of the building.  He also called attention of the members of the committee to the fact that bids for the construction of the Mines and Auditorium buildings will be opened this afternoon, and asked the committee to meet at 5 o'clock this evening.  In accordance with this request the committee will hold a meeting at that time.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kirkendall announced that he would start on an eastern trip tomorrow night, and would be absent several weeks.  As this would leave only three members of the executive committee in the city, Managers Reed and Babcock being already out of the city, the rules of the committee providing that four members should constitute a quorum were changed to provide that for the next thirty days three members should constitute a quorum.</p>

                            <p>After these bids had been acted on a contract was presented by Manger Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds.  This contract covered the construction of the Mines building and Mr. Kirkendall stated that it had been drawn by Mr. Geraldine of his department.  Upon looking it over the committee discovered that the phrase "General Superintendent Dion Geraldine" occurred with great frequency.  Some of the members of the committee objected to this designation for the reason that Mr. Geraldine was employed simply as a superintendent of construction and directions were given to have the contract changed to comport with the facts.  It was also discovered by the committee that the contract was so loosely drawn as to give the widest latitude to the superintendent in passing upon material, and a number of changes were directed to be made to remove this objectionable feature and make the contract more explicit.</p>
                            <p>It developed during the discussion that, by mistake, all the maps, etc., issued from the Department of Buildings and Grounds bore the name of the superintendent of construction with the title "general superintendent."  It agreed that these little things should be remedied.</p>

                            <p>Although it will be more than nine months before the gates of the Transmississippi Exposition will be thrown open to the public, the capacity of some of the buildings promises to be taxed to the utmost to give space for the applicants who have already asked for space.  This is especially true of the Manufacturers building.  Applications for space aggregating more than the total floor space of this building have already been filed with the Department of Exhibits and Superintendent Hardt announced yesterday that fully one-third of the applications would have to be thrown out.  He said the greatest care would be exercised in selecting the exhibits which will be given space, in order that the Manufacturers building may present only such exhibits as are strictly first class in every respect.</p>
                            <p>The great influx of applications for space in the Manufacturers building is not confined alone to domestic manufacturers, but the foreign firms are coming in at a rapid rate with applications for large sections of space.  Superintendent Hardt has recommended to the executive committee that a separate building be erected for these foreign exhibits, but no action has yet been taken on his suggestion.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Publicity and Promotion was seriously inconvenienced by the fire at the plant of the Rees Printing company.  The printing of 15,000 illustrated pamphlets had just been completed and were to have been delivered to the department yesterday.  These were all destroyed by the flames and water and none of them can be used.  The type forms, however, were uninjured, with the exception that the cuts of the buildings were badly warped.  New cuts were put in the forms and they were taken to a neighboring establishment and the work of printing the pamphlets was resumed.  The loss will make it impossible for the Department of Publicity and Promotion to supply the demand for these pamphlets for a few days.</p>

                            <p>The fireproof material for the construction of the Art building has been decided upon.  The frame work of the building will be of wood, the same as the other buildings, but this wood will be entirely covered, inside and out, with a fireproof material somewhat similar in outward appearance to staff.  This will be moulded in large sheets and will be handled much the same as large boards.  The spaces between the inner and outer walls will be filled with other fireproof material, covering the wood on every side and making solid walls which will be perfectly fireproof.  This material is of such a character it may be handled in cold weather as well as when the weather is warm.</p>

                            <p>Bids for the construction of the mines and mining building and for the auditorium on the exposition grounds were opened by the department of buildings and grounds yesterday afternoon, and later the bids were considered by the executive committee.  The award for the carpentry work on the mine and mining building was made to William Goldie &amp; Son of Chicago, and for the plaster and staff work to Smith &amp; Eastman of Chicago.</p>
                            <p>The estimated cost of the auditorium was $35,000.  It was found that the specifications on which contractors figured called for a considerably more expensive building than this, and the bids were in accordance therewith.  The committee was not ready to award the contract and action with regard to this building was, therefore, deferred.  It is thought that with the present plans and specifications the cost cannot be brought under $50,000, and a change in the plans to bring the cost down may be made.</p>

                            <p>Eight or ten of the bidders were present in the ante room of the department of buildings and grounds at 4 o'clock in the afternoon when bids were to be closed and, as it was supposed, were to be opened and announced.  A few minutes after this hour Superintendent Geraldine of the department of buildings and grounds emerged from his private room, came up to the stout wire screening that divides the ante room in half and said:  "If you gentlemen are here expecting to see the bids opened you will probably not get to hear them.  They will not be opened until late, and they will be announced in the morning papers."</p>
                            <p>Being invited in this way to leave the room, the bidders did some great kicking when they got out into the corridor.  They expressed their indignation in very emphatic terms.  They admitted that the department was not bound to open the bids in their presence, but they called to mind that it was customary for bidders to be present when bids were opened, especially when the bids were on work of this public character.  They complained that they had been treated in about the same way on previous occasions in connection with exposition work, one of them being when the bids were opened the second time for the administration arch.  No one expressed a suspicion that the bids would be improperly handled in the profound seclusion of the private office of the department, but many said that with the method the department had seen fit to adopt the way was open for some one to make complaint of manipulation and collusion.</p>

                            <p>A few minutes after Mr. Geraldine had made the announcement referred to, the bids were opened, and when the executive committee met at 5 o'clock Manager Kirkendall came in bearing the tabulated figures in his hand.  In the course of the meeting the question of opening the bids in the presence of bidders came up.  Manager Kirkendall had not been apprised of the fact that the bidders in this instance felt that they had cause to feel offended, and readily assented to a suggestion that hereafter bids be opened in the presence of the bidders.</p>
                            <p>A mistake which has appeared on all the prints, maps and charts so far issued by the department of buildings and grounds was for the first time officially noticed by the executive committee, though it has been the subject of much comment on the part of exposition employes and contractors.  On these maps, etc., the designation following the name of Dion Geraldine has appeared "general superintendent," and this mistake has even crept into the contract forms of the association, and it was in one of these forms that it was noticed yesterday.  The executive committee changed the wording so that it would be, "Dion Geraldine, superintendent of construction."  The reason given was that some of those not well acquainted with the organization might receive, and indeed had already received, the impression that Mr. Geraldine was the director general of the exposition.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Now that the first rush to get out the working plans for the several main buildings of the Transmississippi Exposition is over, and the drawings are nearly all completed, those having the matter in charge will have time to take up the consideration of the smaller details which are a necessary part of the exposition, but which will not require as much time for their consideration or arrangement.</p>
                            <p>Among other things, no exposition would be complete without a lot of gondolas to skim over the water of the lakes and lagoons.  The water feature of the Transmississippi Exposition will form a prominent attraction in the main court.  The lagoon will extend from the east to the west end of the court, nearly half a mile in length, and will be seventy-five feet in width at the narrowest point and fully 400 feet at the widest point.  This water space will afford plenty of room for fully a score of these picturesque boats, besides other water craft of different designs.  A fine field will be offered for the exhibition of launches of various kinds operated by electricity or other motive force, for canoes and numerous other kinds of boats.</p>
                            <p>It has already been stated that the life saving service of the United States government will utilize the spreading waters of the basin in front of the government building for daily exhibitions of the operations of a life saving crew.  A house for the life boat will be constructed just beyond the colonnade on the south side of the basin, with a runway for shooting the boat into the water.  Every afternoon during the exposition visitors will be startled by a wild cheer as the boat, loaded with people, will shoot into the water.  When well out from the shore the boat will be capsized and the occupants thrown into the water.  The alarm will be given and the life saving crew will bring out its apparatus and fire a life line over the boat.  In the meantime the former occupants of the boat will have grasped the lines attached to the sides of the boat and when the life line is made fast they will be rescued by means of the life car, the breeches buoy, or the many other devices in use in the life saving service for the rescue of persons on a wrecked vessel.</p>
                            <p>Exhibitions of speed between electric launches, canoe races, gondola races and other aquatic sports somewhat out of the ordinary in this section, will be arranged for when the time comes.</p>

                            <head type="sub">FISH EXHIBIT CONSOLIDATED.</head>
                            <p>There appears to be a strong probability that all the fish exhibits at the exposition will be concentrated in the United States building.  The Fish commission has installed a very comprehensive and interesting exhibit at the Tennessee exposition within a smaller space than will be assigned to it at the Transmississippi Exposition.  Assurances have been given that with the enlarged facilities assigned to every department of the government at the latter exposition a much large exhibit will be made by each of the co-ordinate branches of the government than was made at either Atlanta or Nashville.  The live fish exhibit of the Fish commission will embrace all varieties of the finny tribe that could possibly be exhibited in a state or sectional exhibit, and some of the members of the executive committee have expressed the opinion that it would be a useless expenditure of money to erect a separate fisheries building and go to large expense to install an exhibit when the same feature can be secured without any expense to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>A number of schemes have been suggested for a fisheries building, the one most favored contemplating an underground building with huge tanks to convey the impression to the visitor that he is underneath the wild waves of the ocean with the finny monsters all about him.  This has been favorably considered, but is now believed to be a dead issue.</p>
                            <p>This disposition of the live fish exhibit has no bearing upon the manufactured products from fish or the industries which are related to the fish business, as these exhibits will be assigned to their proper place in the Manufactures building.</p>
                            <p>When the main buildings of the exposition were first outlined it was decided that there should be no <choice><sic>gallaries</sic><corr>galleries</corr></choice>.  This decision was the result of sentiment rather than a conclusion reached after duly considering the mechanical questions involved, and subsequent events have demonstrated that galleries are almost a mechanical necessity in the method of construction adopted for the main buildings.  The cornice line of the main buildings is about thirty-five or forty feet above the ground level.  Above this, in most of these buildings, is a clear story rising to a height of several feet, surmounted by a roof, which is approximately sixty feet above the main floor of the building.  This form of construction necessitated the use of posts to support the roof trusses, and it was found that these would have to be braced in such a manner as to virtually form a gallery.  To give artistic finish to this construction it was decided to utilize the second floor space thus created by making galleries.  This will add just 50 per cent to the floor space, which would otherwise be in the buildings without adding materially to the cost of construction.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GALLERIES IN DEMAND.</head>
                            <p>These galleries promise to be in great demand, especially for that class of exhibits which affords opportunity for study on the part of visitors to the exposition.  It has been practically decided that the educational exhibits will be located in the gallery of the Manufactures building.  The Woman's Board of Managers, which has charge of this exhibit, will be assigned as much space in this gallery as is necessary for a satisfactory arrangement of the educational exhibits, and it is expected that this gallery will prove to be a very popular place.</p>
                            <p>All of the galleries will be reached by broad and easy stairs and they will afford excellent opportunities for viewing the lower floor from a most favorable point of vantage.  The gallery floor will be about twenty feet above the main floor, and there will be plenty of space above them for ventilation and lighting.</p>
                            <p>The idea of enlarging the Manufactures building to accommodate the great number of exhibitors who are applying for space has been abandoned.  It was at first proposed to extend one wing of the building, but the architects said the symmetry of the building would be destroyed unless both wings were extended alike.  They also called attention to the fact that the Manufactures and Machinery buildings were opposite each other and that they were designed along the same general lines to such an extent that to enlarge one without enlarging the other would destroy the effect of both buildings.  It was also found that the insurance rate would be effected by extending the wings of these buildings and the project was abandoned.  It has been suggested that in case the Manufactures building proves to be too small an annex could be erected a short distance from it in the southeast corner of

                            the grounds and connected with the main building by a colonnade.  It is argued by the advocates of this idea that more space could be secured for the same money in this way than by enlarging the main building.  There is an unoccupied space in this corner of the grounds which could be utilized in this way to advantage, and it is probable that this solution will be made use of when the necessity arises.</p>

                            <p>The appointment of a mining commissioner will be one of the matters which will necessarily engage the attention of the executive committee in the near future.  The ruling idea in the Transmississippi Exposition, as it has been expressed from the very beginning by those having in charge the molding of the plan of the enterprise, has been to make the agricultural and mining industries the leading features, these being the two lines in which the great Transmississippi region excels the whole earth.  With this idea prominently before them, the architects assigned to the Agriculture and Mines buildings the most prominent locations in the main court, both of them being opposite the main entrance arch where they strike the eye of the visitor as he enters the grounds.  They are larger than any other buildings on the main court except the buildings to be erected by the federal government, and their ornamentation will be such <unclear reason="cut off"/></p>
                            <p>A commissioner of agriculture has been selected in the person of Prof. F. W. Taylor, instructor in agriculture in the University of Nebraska, and he has been hard at work for the past three months working up interest in an agricultural exhibit.  He has secured a number of conventions of agriculturists or kindred branches to hold their meetings in Omaha in 1898, and has done considerable work in the line of securing exhibits connected with agricultural pursuits.</p>
                            <p>The mining industry, however, has been allowed to take care of itself to a considerable extent.  Nothing has been done in the way of a systematic campaign to secure exhibits relating to mining except what has been done by an agent in the Black Hills section and another in Colorado.  Some of the members of the executive committee have been of the opinion for some time that the mining interests should be carefully worked up by an expert in that line, but no action in that direction has yet been taken.  While there is probably enough state pride in each of the mining states to make a creditable exhibit, yet experience in other lines has demonstrated that <choice><sic>en</sic><corr>an</corr></choice> executive head is necessary to accomplish good results.  With this sentiment in the minds of some of the executive committee, it is probable that a bureau of mines will be created in the near future and a chief of the bureau appointed.</p>

                            <p>In answer to the letter sent out by Governor Holcomb, asking the participation of eastern states in the Transmississippi and International Exposition, Governor Tanner of Illinois on Saturday forwarded the following letter, explaining the status of the appropriation made by the Illinois legislature for the participation of that state in the exposition.</p>
                            <p>SPRINGFIELD, Ill., Aug. 7.&#8212;To Hon. Silas A. Holcomb, Governor of the State of Nebraska:  Sir&#8212;I have the honor to acknowledge your favor of August 5, in which you invite the co-operation of the commonwealth of Illinois and its citizens in the Transmississippi and International Exposition, to be held in the city of Omaha in 1898.</p>
                            <p>As governor of the state of Illinois, I have already signed an act making an appropriation of $45,000 for the purpose of erecting a state building on the grounds of the exposition, to be used as the headquarters of Illinois and their friends who <unclear reason="torn"/></p>
                            <p>I am also authorized to appoint a commission of twenty-five members, "who shall have power to devise and execute plans for the display of all such exhibits from the state of Illinois as may, in their opinion, be advisable to represent the resources and advantages of this state."  This commission is further given "power to secure, encourage and assist exhibitors," and "will have full control of said exhibits and general direction of all matters connected with them."</p>
                            <p>No appropriation has been made for the expenses of these commissioners, nor in aid of exhibitors.  I have no doubt that, in view of the financial interests of the business men of Illinois and especially of the city of Chicago, the necessary funds will be provided at private expense, and that the friendly feeling entertained toward the state of Nebraska and its citizens, a full share of whom formerly resided here, will secure a large attendance of visitors from this state.  I shall, after consultation with the proper persons, appoint the commission created by the act, and my personal and official influence will be exerted to bring about the desired co-operation in an enterprise of whose success I am both desirous and confident.  I have the honor to remain, yours very respectfully,</p>

                            <p>C. A. Fellows, mayor of Topeka, Kan., and vice president of the Transmississippi Exposition for Kansas, has written to the Department of Publicity and Promotion regarding an exposition commission for his state.  He advocates the idea very strongly and suggests that in addition to the number already suggested for such a commission there be added a woman.  He says that the World's fair commission for Kansas included two women, and he refers in a very complimentary way to the work done by them.  In this connection Mr. Fellows suggests a prominent Kansas woman for this position saying that she is already stated for appointment as commissioner to Paris.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Fellows spoke encouragingly of the interest which is being manifested in the exposition in his state and predicts that Kansas will be well represented.  He says that it is generally conceded that whatever will help Nebraska will help Kansas and he thinks this sentiment will induce the people of his state to take an active part in the matter.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission will hold its second regular meeting at its headquarters at the Dellone hotel this evening.  There will be a large amount of business to come before the commission, the most important of which will be the assignment of portions of the state appropriation among the various interests of the state and the examination of plans for a state building.  In addition to these matters, the board will also be called upon to pass upon a large number of applications from various people who want to serve the commission in various capacities in connection with the state exhibits at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>In accordance with instructions issued by the commission at its last session, Assistant Secretary Dearing sent letters to all of the various associations of agricultural or kindred interests, requesting estimates of the money that would be required to make creditable exhibits in their lines.  The same letter was also sent to the various state institutions.</p>
                            <p>In reply to these letters estimates have been received from several of the parties addressed.  Of the associations, the poultry men lead the list; they give the commission notice that about $6,000 will be required to make a display of the poultry industry in keeping with the magnitude of that business in this state.  The beekeepers are more moderate and ask for only $2,500.  The agricultural interests are covered by an estimate submitted by Secretary Furnas of the State Board of Agriculture, who writes that he thinks that $12,000 will be the maximum amount which will be required to make a display of the agriculture of Nebraska in a manner befitting its importance.  The Nebraska Fish commission submits an estimate of $5,100 for a state exhibit of the fish industry.</p>

                            <p>For the state institutions one of the most interesting reports is made by Prof. J. A. Gillespie for the Institute for the Deaf.  He asks for about $1,200, and with this he proposes to make an exhibit which will be one of the most attractive features on the exposition grounds&#8212;a living school of deaf mutes, showing the most advanced methods of instruction, including the method used for teaching the pupils the use of their hearing and speaking faculties.  It is proposed to have this school in operation about an hour each day, with a dozen pupils, a teacher and an attendant.  In addition to this feature the exhibit made by this institution will include examples of the work of the pupils which will be shown in the educational department.</p>
                            <p>The University of Nebraska will also be in the field with an exhibit which will be of much more than passing interest.  The plan is stated rather briefly in a letter written by Chancellor MacLean.  He states that he is unable to make an exact estimate of the amount which will be required for the entire exhibit, but says that $1,000 will probably be sufficient for the university exhibit proper, exclusive of the dairy school and sugar school.  The chancellor suggests that $2,000 might be required for the dairy school and advocates the idea of having the state herd of about ten Jerseys, with attendants on the grounds showing the dairy schools in full operation, with the advanced methods of handling dairy products, making butter, cheese, etc.  With reference to the sugar school, the chancellor lays great stress on the importance of this school, and says he has requested Prof. Nicholson to inform the commission regarding the amount of space which would be required and the probable expense of making an exhibit of the beet sugar industry of Nebraska on a scale commensurate with the extent and possibilities of the state in this direction.  Nothing has yet been heard from Prof. Nicholson by the commission regarding the matter.</p>

                            <p>Regarding the exhibit to be made by the university, Chancellor MacLean suggests that a most interesting geological exhibit can be made of the geological freaks found in the northwestern part of the state, including samples of the "devil's corkscrews," which are found nowhere else on the face of the earth.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. F. M. Ford, secretary of the Woman's Board of Managers, repeats the request made heretofore, that the commission set aside $5,000 for an educational exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The state institutes for the blind and feeble minded have not written to the commission regarding the amounts which will be required for exhibits by them, but it is expected that Superintendents Jones and Fall of the institutions named will attend their meeting of the commission to present their respective requests.</p>
                            <p>A number of applications for positions under the state commission will also be laid before the board at this meeting.  The position of superintendent of construction seems to be more in demand than any other.  Five applications for this position have been filed, three of them being by Omaha men&#8212;F. L. Robertson, George Higgins and Churchill Parker, while George Blake of Lincoln and Whittaker of Ainsworth are the other applicants.</p>
                            <p>C. M. Lewelling of Beaver City and E. A. Pegler of Lincoln are applicants for the position of superintendent of the poultry exhibit.  A. E. Sheldon of Dawes county wants to have charge of procuring and arranging the exhibits.  L. R. Fletcher of Bancroft and E. D. Johnson of Lexington ask to be appointed superintendent of the agricultural exhibit.  J. P. Holloway of Lapeer wants to be a guard.  A. J. Williams of Irvington asks to be appointed assistant superintendent of buildings.  John Tannihill of Columbus is ambitious to be superintendent of the seed and vegetable sections.</p>
                            <p>Architects Rittenhouse of Hastings and Grant of Beatrice have submitted plans for a state building.</p>
                            <p>H. J. T. Wert of Auburn, editor of the Nebraska State Poultry Journal, is in the city and will address the commission in the interest of a substantial appropriation for a poultry exhibit.</p>

                            <p>A score of prominent dairymen of Nebraska met at the Millard hotel last evening and discussed ways and means for making the dairy exhibit of the Transmississippi Exposition a grand success.  F. H. Vaughan of Fremont, president of the Nebraska Dairymen's association, presided, and the following directors of the association were present: S. C. Bassett, treasurer. Gibbon: W. A. Poynter, Albion; G. A. Merrill, Minden; W. A. Carpenter, York, and B. R. Stoffer, York.  Among others present were: J. C. Merrill, Sutton; J. J. King, West Point; C. W. Stevenson, Fremont; D. P. Ashburn, Gibbon, and Jules Lumbard, Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The meeting resolved to request of the exposition directory that 100 feet be set aside for a creamery exhibit by the Nebraska Dairymen's association.  It was resolved to recommend to the directory that the dairy exhibit be continuous throughout the exposition.  Other minor suggestions as to the form of displaying butter and of educational work through a dairy school at the exposition were made to the directory in response to a communication from that body.  It was stated that at least seven transmississippi states, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Missouri would be well represented in the dairy exhibits.</p>
                            <p>From the interest manifested at the meeting it is apparent that the Nebraska dairymen are going to work with a hearty earnestness for the success of the dairy exhibit.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Exposition State Commission Fixes the Salaries of the Superintendents Who Will Have Charge of the Departments.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition Commission held a brief session this morning at its offices in the Manderson block and then west into executive session to consider the plans for a state building, submitted by a number of architects yesterday.</p>
                            <p>During the open session preceding the executive meeting, the board appointed a superintendent of horticulture and a superintendent of poultry.  It was agreed before these appointments were made that the appointees would not be put on duty for the present, but would be selected at this time in order to give them authority to formulate plans and agitate the various societies that are expected to make exhibits.  The salary for each position was fixed at $65 per month while employed.  E. A. Pegler of Lincoln was made superintendent of the poultry department and Peter S. Younger of Geneva was appointed superintendent of the horticultural department.</p>
                            <p>A rule was adopted that all employes, including superintendents, shall be subject to discharge at any time the board may see fit to dispense with their services.</p>
                            <p>The special committee appointed last night to confer with the exposition management regarding the rate to be charged the commission for space, met Manager Bruce of the Department of Exhibits at the Commercial club rooms at noon today for conference on this matter.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">FEES FOR ARCHITECTS.</head>
                            <p>Yesterday afternoon a number of architects were present prepared to submit plans for a state building in accordance with the invitation issued by the board at its last meeting.  It was decided that the first business should be the examination of these plans.</p>
                            <p>Before this was done Mr. Dutton suggested that the commission first agree as to the commission which should be paid to the successful architect for his plans and detail drawings, it having been agreed at the last meeting that the commission would employ its own superintendent and mechanics.  This suggestion was adopted and then the commission got into an argument as to what rate of pay should be fixed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Boydston moved that the architect's commission should be 3½ per cent.  He argued that the exposition executive committee was paying its architects that rate, and he believed that the amount was about right.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Whitford said he had understood that the exposition management paid its supervising architects a fixed salary, and employed its draughtsmen by the month to make all the detail drawing for all the buildings, and that the architects of the main buildings had been paid a fixed amount without regard to the cost of the buildings.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Boydston's motion did not receive a second, and Mr. Dutton wanted to fix the commission at 2½ per cent.  His motion to that effect was seconded by Mr. Poynter and an argument was indulged in by all the members.  The matter was finally settled on the basis suggested by Secretary Casper, who moved that the compensation of the architect be fixed at 3 per cent.</p>
                            <p>The architects were then invited to submit their plans, and each man was given ten minutes to explain his drawings.</p>
                            <p>Those submitting plans, and the order in which they appeared before the board, were these:  Zander of Omaha, Rittenhouse of Hastings, Irwin of Omaha, Voss of Omaha, and Craddock of Lincoln.</p>

                            <head type="sub">COLLECTING GRAINS AND GRASSES.</head>
                            <p>Last evening when the board reconvened Assistant Secretary Dearing was called on for a report on the replies received from the various agricultural societies regarding collections of grains and grasses for exhibits.  He read a large number of <choice><sic>lettters</sic><corr>letters</corr></choice> received from nearly every section of the state.  These letters were generally unsatisfactory and demonstrated that this method would never result in a collection which would be worth shipping to Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The members of the board were unanimous in the opinion that it was absolutely necessary that one or more men be appointed at once to gather these grains and grasses at once before it was entirely too late. In this connection a letter from Secretary Furnas of the State Board of Agriculture was read, stating that 10,000 "tufts" of wheat, oats, etc., would be required for decorating, and that these must be gathered at once.</p>
                            <p>It was decided to employ one man at a salary of $65 per month to collect the necessary specimens of grains and grasses for decoration and for exhibits, and to store them in a suitable manner.  E. D. Johnson of Lexington was elected to this position.</p>
                            <p>The matter of deciding upon a plan for a state building was then broached, but Mr. Poynter suggested that before proceeding any further in that direction an understanding should be had with the exposition management regarding the amount and location of the space which would be required for the state exhibits, and the amount which would be charged by the exposition.  Mr. Poynter said it might be desirable for the state commission to erect a building for the various exhibits to be made under its direction in case satisfactory arrangements cannot be made with the exposition management, and in this case he said it would be useless to decide upon a building which was only designed as a headquarters and office building.</p>
                            <p>This suggestion met with favor, and President Neville, Secretary Casper and Mr. Poynter were constituted a committee to interview Manager Bruce of the Department of Exhibits regarding this matter.</p>
                            <p>In order that this special committee might have a basis for its estimate, the commission took up the requests for space which had been filed by the several state societies.  The figures were as follows:  State Horticultural society, 2,000 square feet; State Fish commission, 2,000 feet; beekeepers, 400 feet; agricultural exhibit, 7,500 feet; educational exhibit, 5,000 feet.  Under this last head it was decided to place the exhibits to be made by the University of Nebraska and other state institutions.  This gave a total space amounting to about 17,000 feet.  The space for a poultry exhibit will be in addition to this, it being undecided whether space could be secured in a building to be erected by the exposition management or whether it would be necessary to erect a separate building.</p>

                            <p>G. A. Marshall of Arlington, Neb., president of the State Horticultural society, has issued a call for a meeting of the executive board of that society to confer with delegates from horticultural societies of other states, in this city, on Thursday, August 12, at 1 o'clock.  The object of the conference is to discuss ways and means for making a grand horticultural exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition.  It is proposed to hold the greatest apple carnival ever known in the west in connection with the horticultural display, and arrangements for this carnival will be made at Thursday's meeting.</p>

                            <p>Wong Chin Foo, Chinese commissioner for the exposition, will be in the city tomorrow to consult with the officials of the exposition regarding matters in his jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Exhibits is preparing to send an agent to the state fairs of Illinois, Minnesota and Iowa to secure the cream of the live stock exhibits of those fairs.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Powell writes from Mexico to the Department of Exhibits that he can secure the attendance of the Mexican Military band at the exposition on the most favorable terms.  The matter will be referred to the Bureau of Music.</p>
                            <p>M. J. Dowling of this city is now at St. Joseph, Mo., negotiating for the transfer of the house made famous by the occupancy of Jesse and Frank James.  If successful he will bring it to this city for exhibition at the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
                            <p>The Board of Directors of the exposition will hold the regular monthly meeting Friday afternoon of this week at the headquarters in the Paxton block.  Among the matters which will probably come before the board will be the filling of the vacancy caused by the death of Dan Farell, jr.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Exhibits, Publicity and Promotion will combine in a movement having for its object the securing of as many as possible of the twenty-four national associations of breeders of live stock to hold their annual conventions in Omaha.  Some of these societies have fixed places of meeting, but an effort will be made to induce all of the others to meet in Omaha and participate in the agricultural and live stock congresses.</p>
                            <p>R. F. Hodgins, commercial agent for Ohio, writes to the Department of Exhibits that he is meeting with great success in his mission of interesting Ohio manufacturers in the exposition and in working up a sentiment favorable to a state exhibit.  He sent an application for 1,050 feet of space by the Hallwood Cash Register company and says that within a week he will have applications from nearly a score of the most prominent manufacturers in central Ohio.  He also reports that interest in a state exhibit is increasing and that the state will make an exhibit which will be one of the most attractive of that made by any state.</p>

                            <p>The projected Agricultural congress which is being worked up by the Promotion bureau of the Department of Publicity and Promotion, to be held during the summer of 1898 in connection with the Transmississippi Exposition, has received the official sanction of the Department of Agriculture of the federal government.  Secretary of Agriculture Wilson has written to the Department of Publicity and Promotion that the proposed congress is a most laudable undertaking and will be heartily supported by his department.  The secretary says that the central location of Omaha and its proximity to the great <choice><sic>agricultureal</sic><corr>agricultural</corr></choice> region of the country will have a strong influence in making the congress a success.  He promises that the Department of Agriculture will be represented at the congress and that he will make an effort to be present in person.</p>
                            <p>The suggestion of a congress of this nature is meeting with strong favor from the Boards of Agriculture of the several states, especially those of the central east.  Letters have been received from the secretaries of the boards of these states, endorsing the idea, and promising their support in making it a success.  The secretary of the Indiana State Board of Agriculture is especially enthusiastic, and says that after their state fair is over he will take great pleasure in making suggestions regarding the details of the congress.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Publicity and Promotion will take steps to secure the annual conventions of the numerous national societies of live stock breeders in connection with this congress, as well as the agricultural and horticultural societies.

                            <p>A conference of representative horticulturists of the transmississippi states is being held this afternoon at exposition headquarters for the purpose of arranging for an apple carnival during the Transmississippi Exposition.  This meeting was called at the requests of the Nebraska Horticultural society, which passed a resolution at its last meeting asking the Department of Exhibits to call a meeting to arrange for such a celebration.</p>
                            <p>Prof. F. W. Taylor, chief of the Bureau of Horticulture, issued the call for the meeting and received encouraging replies from a number of prominent horticulturists in the surrounding states.  He stated this morning that he expected from a dozen to a score at the meeting and had received letters from others expressing their willingness to assist in the movement, but stating that they were unable to attend the meeting.  The members of the Nebraska Horticultural society were in the city this morning prepared to attend the meeting.</p>
                            <p>The meeting was scheduled for 2 o'clock, and in addition to considering the idea of an apple carnival it will also take up the matter of a horticultural exhibit.  The general plan of the exhibit, the time which will be <choice><sic>alloted</sic><corr>allotted</corr></choice> to each kind of fruit and the space which it will occupy, as well as the order in which the exhibits will be arranged in order to have each fruit at its best, will all be considered, and the general rules of the display will be mapped out in the form of suggestions to the Department of Exhibits.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Portions of the Craft May Be Brought to This City.</head>
                            <p>Considerable interest has been aroused in the effort being made to secure parts of the old battleship Omaha for exhibition at the Transmississippi Exposition and for permanent keeping in the city's library after that event closes.  As previously stated, General Manderson has taken the matter up with the government, and is endeavoring to get hold of the desired objects.</p>
                            <p>James E. Preston, contracting freight agent of the Milwaukee road, spent some time at the United States government quarantine station at Angel Island, Cal., last year, and now has on exhibition in the window of the Milwaukee office three excellent photographs of the Omaha, which he took at that time.  The old battleship is now used as the barracks for Chinamen transferred at the quarantine station.  Its deck is roofed over, and it appears like anything but a man-of-war.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Preston was at Angel Island when the ship was anchored there, and says that it is securely held by an anchor eleven feet long and weighing two tons, planted ashore.  He thinks the two most attractive parts of the ship for exhibition here would be the <choice><sic>figurehad</sic><corr>figurehead</corr></choice> of the bowsprit and the large eagle which adorns the stern of the vessel.  The eagle is carved out of heavy oak and measures twelve feet from tip to tip.  It has stood the test of time well and would make a permanent attraction for the public library.  The old ship's gig, Mr. Preston thinks, might also be secured and would prove interesting.  It is an eight-oared gig, about twenty feet long, and is handsomely finished inside with mahogany.</p>

                            <p>The Grote Chemical company of Shirley county, Indiana, has applied for additional space for an exhibit of its wares, and the Royal Worcester Corset company has made a similar application.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Yesterday afternoon's session of the Nebraska Exposition commission was delayed to await the return of the special committee which was in consultation with Manager Bruce regarding space for the state exhibits.  When the committee returned it reported that a most satisfactory session had been held with Mr. Bruce, and that mutual concessions had been made until an agreement was reached that was entirely satisfactory.</p>
                            <p>The report of the committee was discussed in detail and its action was approved.  The committee made application for 20,000 feet of space in the different buildings, and the state exhibits will be arranged in the respective buildings in which each properly belongs.  In addition to this, space will be allotted the commission for its state building for headquarters, reception rooms, etc.  It was agreed that the state building should be located on the bluff tract, near the viaduct across Sherman avenue from the main court.  The details regarding pens for the poultry exhibit and for live stock were not agreed upon, these matters not having been fully determined by the exposition management.  The result of the committee's conference was entirely satisfactory to the commission, and it was then decided to take up the consideration of the plans for a state building.</p>
                            <p>The board went into executive session to decided upon a plan and it was over half an hour before the doors were opened.  It was announced that the contest was between the plans submitted by Rittenhouse of Hastings, Voss of Omaha and the plan submitted by J. H. Craddock of Lincoln and John McDonald of Omaha, working jointly.  The latter plan was finally adopted.</p>

                            <p>The plans of Messrs. Craddock and McDonald shows an attractive looking building of the Grecian classic order of architecture, 76x140 feet on the ground.  The central portion of the building is sixty feet square, surmounted by an octagonal dome, the top of which is about eighty feet above the ground.  At each corner of the central motive are small pavilions.  Wings extend on two sides of this central portion, each wing being forty feet in length.  The wings have a flat roof, the cornice being about thirty-two feet from the ground and surmounted by a balustrade with masts for <choice><sic>penants</sic><corr>pennants</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>The interior of the building is designed with a view of meeting the views of the commission regarding an assembly place and furnishing headquarters for the various societies and the representatives of other states.  The prominent feature of the first floor is an assembly room, 60x100 feet, with large offices opening from it on all sides.  The second floor has a gallery overlooking the assembly room, and on the sides of the building are fourteen large rooms for offices, etc.  Toilet rooms, baggage rooms, check rooms, telegraph and telephone rooms, and similar accommodations are provided liberally.</p>
                            <p>In addition to deciding upon a plan the board, while in executive session, appointed George Blake of Lincoln superintendent of the building at a salary of $3.50 per day while employed; J. E. Knowles of Omaha assistant superintendent at a salary of $2.75 per day; E. W. Crane of North Platte timekeeper at $60 per month; A. J. Williams of Irvington and Patrick Hinds of Hastings guards at $2 per day.</p>
                            <p>It is the intention of the commission to erect the building by day's labor, buying the material and employing its own men, the appointees last mentioned to have supervision of the construction and material.</p>
                            <p>At the meeting of the commission last evening it was decided to appoint a superintendent of the apiary, and L. D. Stitson of York was selected for the place at the same salary allowed the other superintendents.</p>
                            <p>The commission then adjourned till August 25.</p>

                            <p>The committee of ten appointed at the last meeting of the executive committee of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi association to consider candidates for the officers of the new organization, met in the office of Dr. Cleaver at Council Bluffs yesterday and performed the duties assigned to it.  The first regular meeting of the committee will occur at the city building this evening, and the candidates selected for president, vice president and treasurer will be presented and the best men selected.  A great deal depends upon getting working officers as well as a working executive committee of fifty, and it was for this reason that a portion of the work of selecting them was delegated to a special committee selected for the purpose.  Secretary Judson has received replies from all of the members of the committee to whom he addressed his letters notifying them of their election to the executive committee and requesting an answer to the query whether or not they would accept the office and work on the committee.  There have been several declinations, and the vacancies will be filled at the meeting this evening.  The idea has been generally promulgated that the committee of fifty is to be a working organization, and that there will be no figure heads or drones in it.  This committee will be divided up into seven subcommittees of seven members each, who will be selected with regard to their special fitness for the work that will be assigned them.  It will be perceived that a great deal of care and good judgment will be necessary in making up these committees.  The committees and their work will be as follows:</p>
                            <p>Transportation&#8212;To secure the best transportation facilities to and from the exposition grounds, and further, to provide for monthly excursions of exposition visitors to Council Bluffs.</p>

                            <p>It is expected that these committees will be at least partially selected at the meeting of the committee tonight, and it will be well for the members to familiarize themselves with the work that is ahead of them.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, Aug. 11.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Chief Constructor Crane of the supervising architect's office, immediately upon his return from Omaha, was granted a short leave of absence.  He will be away for about ten days, and immediately upon his return will begin work on the design and plans for the government building to be placed in the Transmississippi Exposition grounds.  Acting Supervising Architect Kemper, in speaking of the proposed building today, said:  "The government building at the Omaha exposition will be as fine as temporary structure as can be erected with the funds at our disposal.  Mr. Crane will begin work upon a new design as soon as he returns from his leave, and I think the plans will be completed in about three weeks after that.  The work will certainly be placed on the market in six or seven weeks.  Mr. Crane, in discussing the building with me during the short time I talked with him, said that he would design a building that will harmonize with the general design for the other buildings proposed to be erected by the exposition company.  It will be constructed of hard wood and mast, the latter being a preparation with which some very very beautiful effects may be obtained.  The whole building will be put upon the market in one contract.  There will be no delay in completion after it is once started."</p>
                            <p>William T. Hastings, editor of the Fullerton News, has been called to Washington by Assistant Secretary Meiklejohn, through the Civil Service commission, to a place in the War department.  He will be transferred from there to a good position in the government printing office.</p>

The decision says that all evidence introduced proves conclusively that Schimmer is entitled to the land, and that no new question of law or fact is presented that justifies reversal of the former decision.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ARCHITECTS NOW ENGAGED IN THE WORK</head>
                            <head type="sub">Intention that Structure Be Enclosed This Season that it May Be Used for Storing Nebraska Exhibits for Exposition.</head>
                            <p>The architects having the contract for designing the Nebraska building for the state commission are busily engaged in working out the detail drawings and specifications in order that bids may be asked as soon as possible for furnishing the material.  It is the intention of the commission to erect the building by day's labor.  The staff work will probably be done under contract.</p>
                            <p>It is expected that the building will be far enough along before cold weather to be used for storing the large quantities of grains and grasses which will be collected this fall for decorative and exhibit purposes.  The work of collecting these grains and grasses will be commenced at once and a large store room will be necessary to properly care for this material.  It must be kept away from the light and protected against dust and mice.  In order to furnish the necessary storage room work on the state building will be rushed and the building will be enclosed before winter sets in.  The present intention is to defer putting on the staff until spring, in which case the exterior of the building will be "sheeted."</p>
                            <p>The collecting of materials for decorating and for exhibits during the early stages of the exposition is one which caused considerable discussion among the members of the commission at their meeting this week.  There was considerable talk about buying the fruits and certain other materials needed for the purpose, and an estimate was submitted by the horticulturists as to the probable cost of various kinds to keep the horticultural exhibit in good order.  The matter of buying corn, wheat and other grains was also discussed, but nothing was settled regarding this matter.  It was generally conceded that this method would prove entirely too expensive to be practical, but no other method was decided upon.  It is thought, however, that another plan may be adopted which will be much more satisfactory and produce even better results.  This plan has not developed sufficiently to be made public at this time.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Association to Look After the Council Bluffs End of the Show.</head>
                            <p>The Council Bluffs Transmississippi Exposition association was finally organized last evening and the permanent officers elected for the full term of its existence.  No other organization formed in the recent history of Council Bluffs has had the care bestowed upon it and the work of selecting its members and officers given such close attention as this, and it is confidently believed that it will exert more than ordinary influence upon the destinies of the city during the next year.</p>
                            <p>The report of the committee of ten directed to select the men who were to constitute the officers made its report at the meeting last night.  A. C. Graham was recommended for president, Dr. J. H. Cleaver for vice-president, C. H. Judson for secretary and E. W. Hart for treasurer.  It was generally known before the meeting convened whom the committee had selected and its report was promptly approved.  The committee also submitted the names of fifty men who will constitute the executive committee, each of whom had given the secretary his assurance that he would accept the office and discharge the duties assigned him and nearly the entire number were present at the meeting last night.  The seven subcommittees are to be made up from this membership were also reported by the committee of ten and approved.  They are as follows:</p>
                            <p>Transportation&#8212;J. H. Cleaver, M. F. Rohrer, E. F. Test, J. M. Barstow, S. Haas, J. P. Greenshield, W. I. Smith.</p>

                            <p>Printing&#8212;W. C. Boyer (chairman), A. C. Graham, George N. Bowen, M. Wollman (secretary), George S. Davis, J. A. Hereld, J. E. Hollenbeck.</p>

                            <p>Following the announcement of the appointment of the committees it was suggested that the members of each get together and organize by the selection of chairmen, and all of the adjoining rooms in the city building were utilized for committee meetings.  J. P. Hess was made chairman of the committee on exhibits, and it was decided to hold the first meeting at the office of Day &amp; Hess tomorrow evening at 8 o'clock.  The literature committee decided to meet in the Grand hotel this afternoon at 2 o'clock and select its chairman and plan the work of the campaign.  The solicitation committee meets for the same purpose at the Nonpareil office at the same hour.  The finance committee was not able to perfect its organization.  The committee on printing organised by choosing W. C. Boyer chairman and M. Wollman secretary, and the legislation committee chose I. M. Treynor for its chairman.  The committee on transportation named E. F. Test for its chairman and selected the office of Dr. Cleaver for its meeting place.  All of these committees will meet and arrange their work and report at the next meeting of the general committee in the city building next Thursday evening.</p>
                            <p>The committee on solicitation was notified that the Third regiment of the Iowa National guard would meet next week at Osceola, and it was recommended that the committee secure the next encampment of the regiment at Council Bluffs.</p>
                            <p>F. A. Bixby announced the receipt of a telegram from Cedar Rapids conveying the information that the grand lodge of the Ancient Order of United Workmen would meet in Council Bluffs next year.</p>
                            <p>The matter of securing permanent headquarters for the association was taken up for discussion and a committee, consisting of Treynor, Rohrer, Boyer, Hess and Test, was appointed to look up a suitable place and report at the next meeting.  Mr. Rohrer suggested the idea of a midday lunch at one of the hotels or restaurants, where the members of all the committees could get together and talk matters of interest connected with their work while they ate.  The proposition immediately met the approval of all present, and it was decided to have these lunches each Friday.  The committee on headquarters was instructed to select the room with special reference to its proximity to some good hotel or restaurant, where these midday lunches could be served.  It was suggested that the hotels and restaurants be invited to submit bids for fifty dinners every Friday during the next year.  These dinners will enable the full committee or a large portion of its members to meet every week, in addition to the regular meetings, after the plan of the Commercial club in Omaha, and will fix a date when a majority of the members of the committees can always be found.  A plan to assess each member the cost of the meal, whether he was present or not, was suggested, but was not approved.</p>
                            <p>After the meeting adjourned the committee on location held a brief session and decided on the course it would follow in making its selection and arranged for the meeting of the committee to do its work.</p>

                            <p>Work on the Administration building is progressing slowly, the building being up to the point where the main cornice will be put on.</p>
                            <p>The railway tracks into the main court have been laid along each side of the court at the rear of where the main buildings will be and all is ready for making the connections across Sherman avenue.</p>
                            <p>Director Phinney of the United States band of Chicago is in the city looking after an engagement with the exposition.  The general manager of T. P. Brooke's Chicago Marine band will arrive tomorrow on the same errand.</p>
                            <p>Wong Chin Foo, commissioner for the Chinese section of the exposition, is in the city in conference with the exposition management regarding the Chinese exhibit.  He promises an extensive and interesting exhibition, but says he is not ready to make his plans public.</p>
                            <p>The artesian well on the exposition grounds has been "bottled up" by having a reducer with a faucet put on the top of the tube so that the flow may be entirely shut off at will.  The well is usually the center of a group of thirsty bicyclers and the water is in demand.  The tall derrick of the well drillers has been removed and the pipe of the well sticks up from the bottom of the ditch made for the purpose of carrying off the water which formerly flowed out of the pipe.</p>
                            <p>Bids for the construction of the Machinery and Electricity building have been invited by the Department of Buildings and Grounds, to be opened at 5 o'clock, August 25.  It is probable that the objections made by bidders against the practice which has prevailed in this department of opening bids in private without allowing bidders to be present will be heeded in the future and that more publicity will be given to these matters.  This action has formed the subject of discussions in the meetings of the executive committee and it has been directed that all ground for objections should be removed.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition held a special meeting at the Commercial club rooms yesterday afternoon.  Managers Lindsey, Bruce and Rosewater were present, together with President Wattles, who is in charge of the Department of Buildings and Grounds during the absence from the city of Mr. Kirkendall.  Managers Reed and Babcock are also out of the city, leaving a bare quorum of the committee.</p>
                            <p>After discussing some minor matters, the railway question was brought up by Manager Rosewater, who introduced the following resolution:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The proposed contract granting to the Missouri Pacific railroad the exclusive right of way through the exposition grounds, and fixing the switching and transfer charges for building materials and <choice><sic>hibits</sic><corr>exhibits</corr></choice> over its tracks, has not been ratified, and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The Missouri Pacific railroad in anticipation of a contract is laying tracks on the exposition right of way; therefore, be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the president is hereby directed to notify the manager of the Missouri Pacific railroad to discontinue the construction and tracklaying on the exposition grounds until a contract satisfactory to this board has been concluded.</p>
                            <p>In support of the resolution Mr. Rosewater said he thought is very unbusiness like to allow any railroad to lay its tracks upon the grounds before a contract had been agreed upon.  The question of handling cars inside the grounds was one of importance and should be fully considered before the contract is closed.  He said it might be that some other method of handling cars might be devised which would save money to the exposition.  Under the terms of the proposed contract the shipper was required to pay a terminal charge of $4 per car, in addition to the usual switching charge of $2 per car.  Instead of allowing the railroad company to collect this charge Mr. Rosewater said it might be found expedient for the cars to be handled with horses or mules for a less price and money turned into the exposition treasury, while that paid for handling the cars would be distributed among local teamsters.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WATTLES MAKES A STATEMENT.</head>
                            <p>In reply to the statement by Mr. Rosewater, Mr. Wattles said that he knew little about the matter and had done nothing with it since Mr. Kirkendall's absence.  All that was done was under the direction of Mr. Kirkendall or his superintendent of construction.  Mr. Wattles said that the contracts made with the contractors of the main buildings were all being drawn by Mr. Geraldine to provide that the exposition should provide trackage facilities for hauling the lumber and other material of the contractors into the grounds, and if the trackage was not provided the exposition would be responsible to the contractor.  He argued that it was absolutely necessary that the tracks be laid at once.  He went into the history of the railway matter, saying that the principal provisions of the contract had been arranged by Manager Babcock before he left the city.  Mr. Wattles also stated that he had seen General Manager Bidwell of the Elkhorn road, who said that his road did not care to enter the grounds.</p>
                            <p>"Mr. Bidwell says he was not approached in the matter until it was too late for him to do anything," interjected Mr. Lindsey.  "He says that his road feels that it has not been treated as it should have been, and that it has been shut out of the grounds."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles said he knew nothing about the matter, as it had been in the hands of the Department of Buildings and Grounds.  He discussed the terms under which he said the contract which had been drawn allowed the Missouri Pacific to enter the grounds.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">DRAWN IN ST. LOUIS.</head>
                            <p>It developed during this part of the proceedings that the railway contract had been drawn by the attorneys for the Missouri Pacific in St. Louis, and had been sent to General Agent Phillippi of Omaha for execution by the exposition officials.  It was presented to Manager Babcock before he left the city for an eastern trip, and he glanced over it hurriedly, noting several changes, and directing Superintendent Owens of the Transportation Department to return it to the Missouri Pacific for correction.  He also directed Mr. Owens to go over it very carefully when it was returned and not to allow it to pass with the endorsement of the department unless the interests of the exposition were fully protected.  It was returned to the Missouri Pacific, and after a lapse of nearly three weeks Mr. Owens inquired of the railway people why it had not been returned.  He was informed by them that it had been returned to Superintendent of Construction Geraldine two weeks before.  The same day Manager Kirkendall brought the contract to Mr. Owens and said it must be taken before the executive committee for approval, at the meeting to which he was then en route.  Mr. Owens declined to pass upon such an important document in five minutes.  The contract was then left with him for examination, and he proceeded to go over it.</p>
                            <p>The contract was largely on a printed form and was drawn in such a way as to give the railway company absolute control over the tracks inside the exposition grounds.  It was an "ironclad" document, in which the interests of the railway company were fully protected.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <p>Mr. Owens suggested a number of alterations in the document calculated to give the exposition some protection and embodied his suggestions in a letter to his chief.  Mr. Babcock endorsed the suggestions of Mr. Owens and instructed him to approve a contract drawn in accordance therewith.  The railway company was notified of this action,
                            
                            <pb n="231" xml:id="TMISB02-231"/>
                            
                            and it is reported that another contract was prepared by the railway officials and submitted to the Department of Buildings and Grounds for approval.  If such is the fact, it has been very carefully concealed behind the heavy iron screen partition which divides the ante-room to the inner chamber of the office of the superintendent of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, and guards those sacred precincts from intrusion by prying stockholders and the common people.  No contract has been submitted to the Department of Transportation or to the executive committee for examination or approval, but the Missouri Pacific is laying its tracks on the main court, one side having been completed and the other being almost finished.  It was this condition of affairs which led to the calling of the meeting.</p>
                            <p>During the discussion which developed, the foregoing facts, Mr. Lindsey supported the position of Mr. Rosewater, that the laying of tracks should not be allowed to proceed until the contract had been agreed upon.  Mr. Wattles urged the necessity for haste in getting the tracks laid, in order to avoid delay by contractors being obliged to haul their material in wagons.  Mr. Bruce supported Mr. Wattles.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater ridiculed the idea that there was necessity for such tremendous haste that the work could not wait a few days.  He said there was but little over a mile of track inside the grounds and this could be laid in three days, if necessary.  He said it looked very funny that there was such a great rush now when the contract had reposed in Mr. Geraldine's desk two weeks without being submitted to the proper authorities.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Lindsey called attention to the fact that there had been no second to Mr. Rosewater's motion to adopt the resolution.  Mr. Bruce did not volunteer to second the motion, as he was opposed to it, and President Wattles had no vote and could not second it if he had been so inclined.  The chairman did not exercise his right to second a motion and the resolution went by default.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater gave notice that he would bring the matter up before the meeting of the board of directors, to be held at 4 o'clock this afternoon, and then the discussion turned upon another topic.</p>

                            <p>"At a conference held in Transportation Manager Babcock's office about July 7 of Mr. Geraldine, Mr. Babcock, Mr. Rathburn, Mr. Phillippi and Mr. Bush, the matter of laying tracks, etc., was fully and freely discussed, and it was agreed with the Missouri Pacific Railroad company to put the tracks in on the grounds, as required by the exposition people, for the prompt handling and unloading of building material, as well as exhibits, and it was further understood that if it was necessary that during the time of the exposition any portion of the tracks should be taken up, the Missouri Pacific would do so and relay them after the exposition, so as to remove all material and exhibits.</p>
                            <p>"It was further agreed that an engine, foreman and switchman were to be placed inside of the grounds subject to orders of the exposition people, to do all work that was necessary.  In consideration of all this, the Missouri Pacific Railroad company was to receive $4 per car for switching loaded cars in or out, no charge to be made for handling the empty cars or for any extra switching inside the grounds.</p>
                            <p>"This switching charge was suggested by Mr. Babcock, the transportation manager, and accepted by the Missouri Pacific Railway company.  It was also understood at that time that a switching charge of $4 would be collected by the exposition people and paid to the Missouri Pacific, but, afterwards, at the request of Mr. Babcock, this was waived; furthermore, the company has waived other rights, heretofore never waived in the construction of private tracks, all to accommodate the exposition people.</p>

                            <p>"The number of carloads that will be handled and for which the charge of $4 is made; it is admitted by experienced railroad men that here will be no profit to the Missouri Pacific Railway company.  There is no desire on the part of that company to monopolize, but it must be admitted that one company can handle and accommodate the exposition people better than two or more.  As to the commencement of building these tracks, it was done at the earnest solicitation of Mr. Kirkendall and Mr. Geraldine, before the contracts were signed, with the understanding that the contracts would be promptly signed."</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Rathburn of the Missouri Pacific this morning said:  "I do not care to enter into any newspaper controversy, but I do not think that our position has been quite fairly represented.  We have waived rights of the company in the proposed contract never waived before, for example, that of holding the exposition association responsible for damage to cars or other railroad property by fire.

                            <head type="sub">What is Being Done to Prepare for the State's Exhibit.</head>
                            <ab>Helena Independent.</ab>
                            <p>The Transmississippi Exposition, to open in Omaha in June, 1898, will be in every sense a western enterprise, in that it will be devoted particularly to the display of western products, while the east will be urged to come, not as exhibitors, but as sightseers.  All of the western states are taking an interest in the exposition, and W. H. Sutherlin vice president for Montana, who is attending to the gathering of the exhibit in this state, says Montana will not be a laggard in the enterprise if the present interest keeps up.</p>
                            <p>At the last session of the legislature a bill was introduced near the close of the session providing for the appropriation of $15,000 for a Montana exhibit and also for the appointment of five or six commissioners.  Before the bill became a law it was so amended that it merely provided for the appropriation of $15,000.  Some time before Mr. Sutherlin had been named as the vice president for Montana, it not being the idea at the time that his duties would be more than to attend a meeting at Omaha, if he did that.  As the legislature made no provision for the appointment of any one to take charge of the collection of the exhibit, the duty fell to Mr. Sutherlin.</p>
                            <p>Some time ago Mr. Sutherlin began his work.  He sent out about 2,600 circular letters to farmers, asking them to save some of this year's crop specimens of grain sheaves and grasses.  It was absolutely necessary that this work be done this year, as it is necessary that the agricultural and horticultural exhibit be in place before June next.  The returns from the letters have been most encouraging.  About one-half of the people addressed have responded, saying they will preserve specimens, and if they keep their word, the display will be a handsome one.  Mr. Sutherlin is going to make a special effort to have a good exhibit of the well known bunch grass.  He found when he was in charge of the agricultural exhibit at the World's fair at Chicago that there was more curiosity to see Montana bunch grass than any other agricultural product of the state.  This curiosity he will endeavor to gratify at Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The horticultural display also promises to be fine.  The fruit growers in western Montana have taken hold with enthusiasm, and are going to try to show that Montana is a good state for growing horticultural products.  At the World's fair the fruit was put into jars containing a patent preserving fluid.  It was a failure, so that the fruit exhibit from this state was poor.  Mr. Sutherlin has got hold of a new method of preserving, in which alcohol is the principal ingredient.  There is no patent on it, and he is of the opinion that the fruit exhibit at Omaha will be one to be proud of.</p>
                            <p>He has also sent about 600 letters to wool growers, asking for fleeces.  The responses have been generous, and the visitors will have every opportunity to see what sort of wool Montana produces.</p>
                            <p>But the principal effort will be made to have a great mineral display.  Talking of it recently, Mr. Sutherlin said:  "I have sent out about 800 letters to mining men and companies, and the responses have been even better than I had hoped.  I was over at Butte last week, and found that quite a number of the owners over there are saving good specimens to send to Omaha.  In a letter recently received from the officials at Omaha I was informed that a charge would be made for the space we will occupy with our exhibit.  We are now negotiating as to the amount of space and the sum we will pay.  The price will, I believe, be a nominal one.  I have about decided that a space of 50x50 feet will be about as small as we can get along with for our mineral exhibit.  The display will be arranged in a series of pyramids, and the specimens from each mine kept together, and not scattered around as they were in Chicago.  Our agricultural exhibit will come into competition <choice><sic>woth</sic><corr>with</corr></choice> those from the great agricultural states of the middle west, and will naturally be overshadowed.  But we have the chance to lead the procession with our mineral exhibit, and that is the point I desire to make.</p>
                            <p>"One of the good exhibits we will have in the mineral department," continued Mr. Sutherlin, "will be our display of coal.  At the World's fair we had a poor display of coal, but the promise is good for a magnificent showing of black diamonds in Omaha."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Sutherlin said it had not been necessary to spend much money so far.  "The appropriation is small, and we will not be able to spread ourselves a great deal.  We will have an agricultural, horticultural and mineral display, sure, and as good as we can get together.  There may be an educational exhibit, and the Montana Housekeepers' society have asked for a change to show the women's handiwork.  We may get to these two, but it is not decided.  We will not have a building at Omaha, and will probably make our headquarters in the Nebraska building.  That state is going to put up a big structure, and I have been notified that we can get headquarters in it.  It is understood that Mr. Marcus Daly is going to give as much toward the exhibit at Omaha as the state has appropriated, and if he does of course we can make a better showing than if we have only the $15,000 to go on."</p>

                            <head type="sub">GREAT DISPLAY FOR THE EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Proposition to Transmit Power from the Plant at Kearney is Likely to Attract Wide Attention.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The electrical section of the Transmississippi Exposition promises to be one of the most remarkable exploitations of the progress which has been made in electrical science that has ever been placed before the public.  The applications already on file for space in this section indicate that the field of modern research and invention in electricity will be thoroughly covered.</p>
                            <p>H. B. Hardt, who is an expert in exposition work, having been intimately connected with all the great expositions of the world during the last twenty-four years and who is now associated with Manager Bruce of the Department of Exhibits, as superintendent of the department, says he never seen such indications of success ten months before the opening of an exposition as are manifested in the case of the Transmississippi Exposition.  He says that this is true of all sections in the exhibit department, but especially so in the electrical section.</p>
                            <p>"The <choice><sic>aplications</sic><corr>applications</corr></choice> now on file," said Mr. Hardt, "cover the entire field of electricity.  The exhibits covered by these applications will illustrate the uses of electricity in agricultural work, long distance transmission of power, the recent application of electricity in power distribution, electricity in mining, electro-metallurgical processes and long distance telephony.  In addition to these there will be shown electric searchlights, high-frequency and high-potential apparatus, electric apparatus for domestic use and the method of transmitting intelligence by Hertzen waves.</p>
                            <p>"All of the largest electrical firms in the United States are identified with the exposition," continued Mr. Hardt, "and the exhibits they will make will form a collection of the most interesting and wonderful inventions of the electrical age.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">TRANSMISSION OF POWER.</head>
                            <p>"If Mr. Bruce can secure from the telegraph or telephone companies, having wires between Omaha and Kearney, the temporary use of these wires, the General Electric company of Schenectady, N. Y., proposes to transmit by its new single-phase apparatus several horse power from its water power at Kearney to operate a model water power plant in the Electrical building free of cost to the exposition.  If this can be arranged it will mark an era in the history of power transmission and will attract wide attention.  This same company has already made arrangements to exhibit the operation of its single-phase, alternating current, electrical railway apparatus with rotary converters, electrical mining apparatus, searchlights and high-potential and high-frequency apparatus.</p>
                            <p>"This simply gives an idea of the nature and extent of the display which will be made in the electrical section," continued Mr. Hardt.  "Other manufacturers of electric apparatus will make equally interesting exhibits.  Prof. Owens, who is now in the east negotiating with the large firms for space, has forwarded an application from the Crocker-Wheeler Electric company of New York City for an application for 200 feet of space.  He writes that this is simply an opening and that the company will undoubtedly take ten times that amount of space.  The professor says he expects a number of particularly interesting exhibits from this company.  He also says that there is every probability that he will be successful in securing the next meeting of the National Electric Light association and the National Street Railway association, both of which meetings he will attend.</p>
                            <p>"In addition to these indications," said Mr. Hardt, "Commissioner T. C. Martin, who is commissioned to represent the electric section in the state of New York, writes that he is making efforts to secure from the patentee of a German invention for electrical plowing the use of the apparatus to operate near the irrigation farm on the exposition ground.  The department has promised every facility for showing this invention to the best advantage.</p>
                            <p>"In this connection," said Mr. Hardt in conclusion, "Mr. Martin, who was general director of the electrical exposition recently held in New York City, says he has had occasion to learn the sentiment of people interested in electricity all over the world, and he says they are generally inclined to participate in the Transmississippi Exposition."</p>

                            authorized to invite bids supplying the pipe necessary for the construction of a sewer on the bluff tract on the east side of Sherman avenue.  Mr. Wattles said he did not know the extent or probable cost of the sewer, but understood that it would cost about the same as the sewer just completed on the main court, which cost $2,700, the department doing the work.  He said the <choice><sic>bide</sic><corr>bids</corr></choice> received for constructing the sewer on the main court court ran as high $6,000, showing that considerable had been saved by having the work done directly by the department.  He announced that so long as he remained in charge of the Department of Buildings and Grounds he would pursue the policy of letting the contracts for all work to the lowest responsible bidder if there was no objection on the part of the committee to such procedure.  He said that under the rules of the committee he had no authority whatever and he asked that he be authorized to follow the course if there was no objection to it.  A motion authorizing and directing the president to proceed along the lines indicated was passed.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater reported on the amount of advertising which had been given the exposition in the east and exhibited a large bundle of American and German papers containing cuts of the main buildings and columns of reading matter, all pertaining to the exposition, <choice><sic>ond</sic><corr>and</corr></choice> furnished by the Department of Publicity and Promotion.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater asked authority for sending J. B. Dinsmore to the meetings of several of the live stock breeders' associations for the purpose of securing the 1898 meetings of these organizations for Omaha in connection with the proposed agricultural congress.  The authority was granted.  Mr. Rosewater also suggested the idea of organizing an interstate encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic, to be held during the exposition.  He said there were fully 125,000 old soldiers in the states of Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota and the Dakotas, and he thought an encampment such as suggested would draw at least one in ten of these men, thereby making a gathering of 10,000 or 12,000 men in addition to the members of their families, which many would bring with them.  The idea was favored by the members of the committee and Mr. Rosewater was authorized to work the matter up at the national encampment, to be held at Buffalo this month.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>If a quorum is present at the regular meeting of the board of directors of the exposition this afternoon it is promised that the contract being negotiated by the department of grounds and buildings and the Missouri Pacific railway for putting construction tracks into the grounds will be well ventilated.</p>
                            <p>This contract has been the under talk among exposition employes for two weeks.  The newspapers have been implored by some of the exposition management and by the Missouri Pacific officials to say nothing about it, for it would turn out all right.</p>
                            <p>No contract has been formally signed nor has one been formally or informally ratified, and yet the railroad company has been at work for two weeks laying its tracks into the grounds, and has them now half way down either side of the court.  When one of the railroad officials was asked Wednesday under what arrangement his company was proceeding with the work, he curtly replied that it was no concern of the public's what the arrangement was, and requested with much abruptness that nothing be said about it since anything in print about it might prevent the signing of the contract.  Before today the railway officials have not been wiling to say more than this.</p>
                            <p>The office of the department of buildings and grounds is a place where newspaper reporters are personae non gratae, and therefore no satisfactory information could be secured from that source.</p>

                            <head type="sub">BABCOCK IGNORED.</head>
                            <p>Ever since Manager Babcock of the department of transportation went away two weeks ago the department of transportation, though it has a representative here of the rank of superintendent and therefore on an official equality with Mr. Geraldine of the department of buildings and grounds, has been entirely ignored in the matter, save for a few telegrams sent to Mr. Babcock saying that work was being delayed because the tracks were not down and beseeching him to consent that any contract be signed that was satisfactory to the buildings and grounds department.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Babcock before going away had received a contract from the Missouri Pacific.  He suggested several changes, and directed that when these were made the instrument be returned to his superintendent.  The latter was not able to get hold of the paper for two weeks, finding it finally in the office of the department of buildings and grounds, and then the department was urging that it be at once ratified by the executive committee, although it appeared that the most essential of the changes suggested by Mr. Babcock had not been made.  One of these was that the railroad should collect the terminal charge of $4 a car from the shipper as well as the switching charge of $2 per car when the car came over the line of another road.</p>
                            <p>The matter came up at a meeting of the executive committee Thursday when Mr. Rosewater offered a resolution that the railroad company be directed to stop its work on the grounds until a contract should be executed.  President Wattles and Mr. Bruce were opposed to this and no action on the resolution was taken, but the railroad company has stopped work.</p>
                            <p>In the course of the meeting President Wattles, who is managing the department of building and grounds in the absence of Mr. Kirkendall, said that he knew nothing definite in regard to the matter and supposed the railroad company was proceeding under an arrangement made with Kirkendall.</p>

                            <p>Superintendent Rathbun of the Missouri Pacific Thursday discharged the gang of track layers in the exposition grounds and also the crew.  They will be laid off until the exposition people sign the contract or agreement with the company.</p>
                            <p>"We have waived all our rights, practically," said Mr. Rathbun.  "I had orders from Mr. Kirkendall, Mr. Babcock and Mr. Geraldine to go ahead with the laying of tracks and I have been compelled to bring rails here that were needed on the main line simply because the gentlemen had said that they were in a hurry for the tracks.</p>
                            <p>"It was about July 7, that Mr. Phillippi and myself met Mr. Geraldine and Mr. Babcock and discussed the matter of tracks and agreed on switching rates inside the exposition grounds.  The rate per car was figured as about enough to pay us for putting down the tracks and paying a crew.  After settling all these matters, with the exception of minor details, I went home and drew up an agreement and submitted it to the exposition.  They objected to some of the details and I waived everything or in other words conceded them everything.  The principal clause was the fire clause whereby the exposition was responsible for damage done by fire to cars standing on the tracks inside the grounds and I waived this, something I have never done before."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rathbun says he will not order the track layers back now until the contract is signed.</p>

                            <p>Regarding the matter of the contract the Missouri Pacific officials say further:</p>
                            <p>"At a conference held in Manager Babcock's office about July 7, of Mr. Geraldine, Mr. Babcock, Mr. Rathbun, Mr. Phillippi and Mr. Bush, the matter of laying tracks, etc., was fully and freely discussed and it was agreed with the Missouri Pacific Railway company to put the tracks in on the ground, as required by the exposition people for the prompt handling and unloading of building material as well as exhibits, and it was further understood that if it was necessary during the time of the exposition any portion of the tracks should be taken up the Missouri Pacific would do so and relay them after the exposition so as to remove all material and exhibits.</p>
                            <p>"It was further agreed that an engine, foreman and switchman were to be placed inside of the grounds subject to the orders of the exposition people, to do all work that was necessary.  In consideration of all this the Missouri Pacific Railway company was to receive $4 per car for switching loaded cars in or out, no charge to be made for handling the empty cars or for any extra switching inside of the grounds.</p>
                            <p>"The switching charge was suggested by Mr. Babcock, the manager, and accepted by the railway company.  It was also understood at that time that the switching charge of $4 would be collected by the exposition and paid to the Missouri Pacific, but afterward, at the request of Mr. Babcock, this was waived.  Furthermore, the company has waived other rights heretofore never waived in the construction of private tracks, all to accommodate the exposition people.</p>
                            <p>"Regarding the number of car loads that will be handled and for which the charge of $4 is made, it is admitted by experienced railroad men that there will be no profit to the railroad company.</p>
                            <p>"There is no desire on the part of that company to monopolize, but it must be admitted that one company can handle and accommodate the exposition people better than two or more.</p>

                            <p>At the meeting of the executive committee of the exposition yesterday authority was given to the buildings and grounds department to advertise for bids for the laying of the sewers in the bluff tract.  The cost of the sewers in the Kountze tract was $2,785, and it is thought the cost of the work on the bluff tract will be about the same.</p>
                            <p>At the suggestion of President Wattles, acting manager of the department of buildings and grounds, the sentiment of the committee was expressed to the effect that on all work to be done by the department, save work done by day labor, competitive bids should be asked.</p>
                            <p>It was agreed that Commissioner Dinsmore of the live stock bureau should attend the meetings of the various national live stock societies with a view to getting them to meet next year in Omaha.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater said that his department had under consideration the bringing about, if possible, of an interstate reunion of the Grand Army of the Republic at Omaha next summer, the territory to comprise the states contiguous to Nebraska.  He thinks an attendance of about 10,000 can be secured.  A representative will probably be sent to the national encampment at Buffalo to promote the scheme.</p>

                            <p>Secretary Nownes of the Sarpy County Agricultural society was in the city yesterday.  He says that the people of his county are getting ready for the exposition.  In order to secure the best sheaf grains and grasses the society in its premium list for county fairs stipulates that the exhibits in these classes winning prizes shall become the property of the society.  The material will then be retained for display at the exposition.  It is thought that this is one of the best ways for achieving the result desired and Mr. Nownes thinks his plan so good that it ought to be adopted by other societies like his own.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles has in mind a plan which he thinks will, if carried out, result in one of the most attractive side features of the exposition.  It is said that a large body of Indians, comprising representatives of all the tribes in America, be brought together.  His idea is that the representatives shall be chosen by the tribes, and the main object is to impress on them the advantages of the civilization which they have seen growing up about them.  A point would be made of interesting these Indians in farming, mechanical and industrial methods.</p>

                            <p>LINCOLN, Aug. 14.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;Governor Holcomb has just received the following letters in answer to his invitation to the governors of eastern states to co-operate in the holding of the Transmississippi Exposition:</p>

                            <p>COLUMBUS, O., Aug. 11, 1897.&#8212;His Excellency, Silas A. Holcomb, Governor of Nebraska, Lincoln:  Dear Sir&#8212;I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of August 5, in which you inform me of the fact that the Transmississippi and International Exposition will be held in the city of Omaha between June and November, 1898.  I have carefully noted that which you say in relation to the proposed exposition and to the desire of the promoters to secure adequate representation from the state of Ohio.  I have already taken the liberty of giving publicity to your letter, thinking that would be the most expeditious way of securing notice of the exposition.  As you doubtless know, the legislature of Ohio now meets biennially, and the next session will not occur until January, 1898.  I beg to assure you that it will give me great pleasure to consider the question of Ohio's representation, and if necessary to bring the matter before the attention of the general assembly.  For the present I cannot go further, but permit me at this time to offer to yourself and to the citizens of Nebraska and the other states of the west my most sincere wishes for the entire success of their great undertaking.  Very cordially, yours,</p>

Holcomb, Governor of Nebraska:  My Dear Sir&#8212;Please accept thanks for the courteous invitations to me and the people of New Hampshire to participate in the Transmississippi and International Exposition next summer.  Our legislature does not meet until the winter of 1899 and there is no fund upon which a draft can be made to pay the expenses of a commissioner to represent the state. While we can have no formal representation at your great exposition, I doubt not that some New Hampshire people will avail themselves of the opportunity to visit Nebraska.</p>

The legislature of this state will meet in January next, at which time it will give me much pleasure to present the matter, and to do whatever I can to have the state represented at your exposition.

                            <p>The governor received a visit today from Vassily Andrejivitch Ebell, the honorary commissioner of Russia and the Russian provinces to the Transmississippi Exposition.  The commissioner expressed himself as anxious that the showing made by his country at the exposition should be a good one.  While at the state house, he filed articles for the incorporation of "The Russian-American Trade and Exposition company," the purpose of which is to promote Russian commercial and industrial enterprises in the United States, and particularly at the exposition.  The capital stock of the incorporation is $50,000.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Plan for Assembling Numerous Tribes of Red Men that They May Be Seen as Described in the Country's History.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>A movement is on foot to make the Transmississippi Exposition in one respect one of the most remarkable events that has ever transpired in this or any other country.  It has already been recorded in these columns that the great industries of the transmississippi region, agricultural and mining, will be made the most prominent features of the exposition of the resources of the granary and treasure house of the world, but the project now on foot trenches upon the domain of history and bids fair to form one of the most instructive features of the entire exposition.  This plan contemplates an extensive exhibit illustrative of the life, customs and decline of the aboriginal inhabitants of the western hemisphere.</p>
                            <p>The projectors of this plan argue that it would be most fitting that the great west, the home of the few scattered descendants of the race which was like the leaves of the trees for multitudes when the first white man set foot on the shores of this great continent, should be the scene of what would undoubtedly be the last gathering of these tribes before the bronzed sons of the forests and plains, who have resisted the encroachments of the white man, are gathered to the happy hunting grounds.  There are scores of tribes represented on the Indian reservations scattered all over the western states, and among the Indians on these reservations are hundreds of old chiefs and warriors who have taken part in more than one encounter in which the blood of their red or white brethren has been spilled.  They have successfully resisted all attempts to "civilize" them and are shining examples of the red man of old, except that they have acquired a number of the vices of the white man.</p>
                            <p>All of these remnants of tribes are wards of the federal government and the plan in question contemplates the co-operation of the government in gathering these people at the exposition in a grand ethnological exhibit.  In addition to the Indians themselves it is proposed to have a collection of Indian utensils of all descriptions and all ages, showing the habits and customs of the various tribes at all stages of their development, together with rare and interesting articles of historical interest.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">GOVERNMENT AID EXPECTED.</head>
                            <p>In order that this plan may be successfully carried out it would be necessary to secure the hearty co-operation of the departments of the general government having control over the Indians as well as of the Ethnological Bureau, which has been engaged for several years in making systematic and thorough investigations into the life, habits, customs and language of the various tribes of American Indians, and has contributed to the annals of history volumes of untold worth regarding this highly interesting study.  The collection of relics and curios made by this department would add immensely to the interest of this feature of the exposition, as the collection embraces large numbers of rare and interesting implements and articles of all kinds found in remote sections.  It is more than probable that the government building will contain the exhibit of the Ethnological Bureau in any event, but it is thought it may be secured for a separate Indian exhibit if such can be arranged.</p>
                            <p>So far as it has been natured the plan contemplates the establishment of an Indian village in which each tribe will be assigned quarters by itself with surroundings which comport, as far as possible, with the general customs of that particular tribe.  Besides the tepees of skin, bark, twigs or whatever the latitude of the original tribes demand as shelter, there will be a "grand council wigwam" where the various dances, religious ceremonies and the hundred other interesting forms in use by the Indians in former years will be performed according to the rules which governed them before the white man interfered.  A space for horse racing and other Indian games will be provided near the village and an exhibition provided which will be of greater historical interest and of a more unusual nature than any other part of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>Another feature which has recently been proposed in connection with the Indian exhibit is an Indian congress of those descendants of the native Americans who have adopted the ways of their white brother and are now called "civilized."  It is thought that this congress might be made a most interesting and unique gathering, as there are among Indians of this country a number of men of the highest intelligence and great business ability.</p>
                            <p>It is said by those in a position to known that the Nebraska Exposition commission will adopt a system of offering premiums for the best county exhibits of agricultural and other products in order to secure a good exhibit of the resources of Nebraska at the exposition.  This matter was left in a very indefinite state at the last meeting of the commission, not having been definitely settled.  There was considerably talk about paying for a great part of the material which would be necessary in arranging an exhibit for Nebraska, but it was generally conceded that the appropriation of $100,000 would not last long if that course was adopted.  It was the general opinion that a great deal of material necessary for decorating the state building would have to be purchased and it was thought it might be necessary to buy some material for exhibition when the time came, but it was virtually decided that it would be impracticable to undertake to buy fruit and other stuff for exhibition.</p>
                            <p>The horticulturists, especially, were "out of sight" with their estimate of the amount of money which would be required to make a good horticultural exhibit.  The estimate they presented contemplated the purchase of apples by the hundreds of barrels, grapes and other small fruits by scores of baskets and other things in the same ratio.  That settled the proposition to purchase material, but no other solution was offered at that time.  It is thought now that the solution has been found in the suggestion that cash premiums in substantial amounts be offered for the counties making the best exhibits.  This would allow the counties to preserve

                            their identity and derive the benefit from their exhibits, stimulating local pride and resulting in a much better state exhibit than could be procured in any other way.  The counties in the state have manifested a great interest in the matter of making an exhibit and have written numerous letters to Assistant Secretary Dearing regarding the matter.  These indicate that there is a strong spirit of rivalry between the counties and that there will be no difficulty in securing creditable exhibits if the state furnishes the space as is now contemplated.</p>

                            <p>An interesting exhibit in the educational section will be that made by the Nebraska Institute for the Deaf and the Institute for the Blind.  Both of these institutions have already outlined the general character of the exhibits which will illustrate the operation of those institutions.  That for the Institute for the Deaf will consist, in part, of a school in actual operation, showing the method in use of instructing the inmates of that institution in all the grades.  This school will undoubtedly prove interesting in all the stages, but the higher grades, where the pupils are taught "lip reading" and the use of the voice, will involve the illustration of the most advanced methods of instruction.  The Institute for the Blind will make a feature of its work in the tuning and repairing of pianos, and in the manufacture of the numerous small articles made in the workshop of the institution.  In addition to these living exhibits each institution will have exhibits of the work of the pupils in competition with the work of the pupils of the ordinary schools in the line of composition and other common school work.</p>

                            <head type="sub">COVERING FOR EXPOSITION BUILDINGS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Factory Being Erected for the Manufacture of the Statuary that Will Ornament the Court of Honor.</head>
                            <p>The contractors for the staff work on the Manufactures and Mines building, Smith &amp; Eastman of Chicago, have commenced the erection of their workshop in which the staff will be manufactured.  The building is 77x53 feet and is located just outside the exposition fence on the south side of Pinkney street, west of Sherman avenue.  It is a one-story structure with a high space in the center.  In this modest looking building will be moulded the statuary of heroic size which will grace the upper portion of the main buildings and the delicate tracery imitating elaborate carving in marble with which all of the large buildings will be profusely decorated.  Here also will be made the plain pastel work, which will present a contrast to the decoration.</p>
                            <p>It is expected that work in the staff shop will be commenced some time next week, giving employment to about twenty men, who will be experienced workers in staff and model making brought from Chicago and other points.</p>
                            <p>The work of making and putting on the staff covering the buildings will be carried on as long as necessary, regardless of the temperature outside.  Here also will be moulded in the shop, and, during warm weather, may be put on the buildings before it is thoroughly dried, but when the temperature falls below the freezing point it will be dried in the shop and may then be put on the buildings at any time.</p>
                            <p>The contract for the staff work on the Administration building will probably be done by Leopold Monet, another Chicago man who was connected with the World's fair.  The contract has not been made with him, but he is in the city and a contract will probably be made within a few days.  It is understood that Mr. Bonet will adopt the more expeditious method of putting the staff on the plain portion of the Administration building after the manner of putting on ordinary plaster.  The decorations and statuary will be molded in the shop and placed in position when dried.</p>
                            <p>The work of making the models for the many groups and single figures of statuary will require a number of expert model makers and almost every day brings one or more of these men to the city.  Some of them have been here for months and small models of several of the main groups have already been made by them and submitted for approval.  This class of work calls for the same skill as is required in the modelling of patterns for marble and bronze statuary and the workshops of the staff contractors will undoubtedly become the centers of interest during the progress of this work.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Carpenters and Contractors Expect to Reach an Understanding.</head>
                            <p>The misunderstanding between Briggs &amp; Cushman, contractors for the carpenter work on the Administration building, and the Carpenters' union will probably reach a settlement tomorrow night.  Before any contracts for exposition work were let a number of contractors in this city entered into an agreement among themselves and formed a combination.  They also agreed with the Carpenters' union to employ none but union labor on contracts secured by them, agreeing to abide by the rules of the union regarding the scale of 30 cents per hour and eight hours constituting a day's work.  On the other hand, the Carpenters' union agreed that no member of the union should work for any contractor not a party to the contractors' agreement.</p>
                            <p>The contractors who made this agreement say the members of the Carpenters' union were the first to violate it by accepting work from contractors not in the agreement.  They say that this action absolved them from any obligation.</p>
                            <p>As a result of this Briggs &amp; Cushman about two weeks ago notified the men in their employ that after that date nine hours would constitute a day's work and that they would pay carpenters but 25 cents per hour.  They served notice that any man who did not care to work under these rules could quit.  One man quit.  The Carpenters' union took the matter up and it has been submitted to arbitration.  It is expected that an understanding will be reached.  Briggs &amp; Cushman say they do not care what the length of a working day is, but they object to paying a poor workman the same wages they pay to a man who can earn the scale.</p>

                            <p>Notices that the Nebraska Exposition commission is organized and well under way have been sent to the exposition vice presidents in each of the transmississippi states by Assistant Secretary Dearing.  These notices inform the vice presidents that Nebraska is ready to co-operate with the other states in every possible way.</p>
                            <p>One of the objects which actuated the commission in choosing a design for a state building was to have a building which would answer for a general headquarters building for all states which desired to use it for that purpose.  The plan adopted complies admirably with this idea.  The lower floor contains a large assembly room suitable for meetings of various kinds, while all around it are rooms of different sizes, intended for parlors and lounging rooms, while telegraph and telephone rooms, baggage rooms, check rooms and toilet rooms are provided generously.  The second floor will have nearly a score of large office rooms, and desks will be provided for the representatives of the different states, where the official duties of their position may be performed with as much privacy as would be obtainable in any building.  This building will be furnished in comfortable and suitable style, and there is every indication that the Nebraska building will be one of the most popular spots on the grounds.</p>

                            <p>Assistant Secretary Dearing of the Nebraska Exposition commission has sent letters to each county agricultural society in the state to ascertain the sentiment in each county regarding the making of county exhibits at the exposition.  Each county society is asked if it will make an exhibit, provided the commission furnishes the necessary space for such exhibit.  The officers are asked to state the minimum amount of space that will be required by their county for making a creditable exhibit and whether they will install the exhibit and keep it in good order during the exposition.  These replies will be laid before the commission at its next meeting, when some plan for securing county exhibits will undoubtedly be formulated.  It is anticipated that the plan of offering substantial premiums for the best county exhibits will be adopted.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Making the Bottom of the Lake Water Tight.</head>
                            <p>The work of putting in the stay piling for the sheeting which is to line the banks of the lagoon is progressing rapidly.  Work was commenced at the northwest corner of the lagoon Saturday morning and continued along the north bank.  At noon today it had reached a point at the east side of Twentieth street.  Two rows of piling are being put in.  One row is against the bank of the lagoon, the piles being driven into the bottom about eight feet and the top of the piling reaching to the top of the bank.  The second row is driven into the bank about eight feet back from the edge, and the first row will be anchored to this to give it rigidity.  The sheet piling will resemble a tight board fence made of two-inch planks and will be built between the piles and the bank, forming a water tight embankment which will keep the water from soaking into the sides of the lagoon.</p>
                            <p>The bottom of the lagoon is being rolled with a twelve-ton steam road roller.  The bottom was first covered with a thick layer of "black dirt," which was mixed with the clay of the bottom with a pulverizer, and then the work of rolling was commenced.  East of Twentieth street the bottom of the lagoon is as level as a floor and hard as the roller can make it.</p>

                            <p>A meeting of the executive committee is called at 4 o'clock this afternoon for the purpose of passing upon several contracts.</p>
                            <p>The McSherry Manufacturing company of Middletown, O., has made application for 200 feet of space for an exhibit of grain drills.</p>
                            <p>Joseph R. Kathrons, advertising agent for the Pabst Brewing company, is in the city investigating the exposition with a view of making a recommendation to his house regarding the making of an exhibit and securing concessions.</p>
                            <p>George F. Mischke, commercial agent for Colorado, has sent to the Department of Exhibits an application for 2,000 of space for a display of mounted animals and a collection of Colorado curios to be made by the Woodend Curio company and McFadden Sons.  Mr. Mischke also says that Jackson, the celebrated landscape photographer of Colorado, is now in the field with four men making photographs of mountain scenery for display at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Contractor Strehlow, who is to do the carpenter work on the Manufactures building, is hauling his lumber to the exposition grounds with teams.  He stated this morning that he would not be ready to begin work for about two weeks, as the lumber for the long posts to be used in the building would not arrive until that time.  The completed and work on the building <choice><sic>completed and work on the building might</sic><corr></corr></choice> be commenced at once but for the delay in the arrival of this part of the lumber.</p>
                            <p>Vice President C. Harrison Parker of Louisiana sends to the Department of Exhibits a letter from Major J. G. Lee, commissioner of agriculture of Louisiana, regarding the exposition.  Major Lee says that he is convinced that the Transmississippi Exposition offers the state of Louisiana the best opportunity it ever had for advertising its resources and inducing immigration.  He says that he has been for some time arranging for a display of fruits, vegetables and other products of the state, which will be a fitting exposition of its most unlimited resources.</p>

                            <p>The indications are favorable for an exhibit by the California wine makers which will form an interesting and attractive feature of the exposition.  It will take the form of a reproduction of Niagara falls, the water being represented by the natural juice of the grape and the rocks of the original being reproduced in glass.  This scheme contemplates a large exhibit, involving the use of 100,000 gallons of California red wine to represent the foaming, dashing water.  The precipice over which the wine is precipitated will be formed of glass, through which electric lights will shed a light intensifying the warm color of the wine, and the grottoes and caves along the banks will also be of glass.  These caves will be large enough to contain several people and will be elaborately decorated with California fauna and furnished with cool retreats wherein visitors may rest and partake of the fruits and wines of California while listening to the thunder of the cataract.  Along the rocky bands about the cataract will be growing citrous trees in full bearing.</p>
                            <p>This project will be carried out by a syndicate of wealthy Californians now being formed through the efforts of Commercial Agent McAusland of California, who has adopted the suggestion of Manager Bruce and Superintendent Hardt of the Department of Exhibits.  He writes to the department that he has secured the co-operation of the presidents of the Chamber of Commerce, Board of Trade, Manufacturers' association and other organizations of San Francisco in the organization of a company to carry the project into operation.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition held a meeting at 5:30 o'clock last night for the purpose of passing upon a number of building contracts.  All but one of the contracts were in accordance with the announcements heretofore made.  The one exception was the contract by which the staff work on the Administration building was given to the Artistic Stucco and Modeling company of Chicago, the contract being executed by Leopold Bonet, president.  The names of those composing the company, or the reason why the contract had been taken from Smith &amp; Eastman of Chicago, to whom it was awarded originally, were not stated.  The only statement regarding the change was that of President Wattles, who said, in recommending the approval of the contract, that Smith &amp; Eastman had relinquished their claim to the work to the other firm, and the exposition had secured a lower figure by $200 than Smith &amp; Eastman's bid.</p>
                            <p>The contracts were approved, subject to the approval by the attorney for the exposition, C. S. Montgomery, and the president and secretary were authorized to execute them.</p>
                            <p>In this connection Manager Rosewater called attention to the fact that the specifications for the roofing, as drawn up for bidders, were worded in such a way as to exclude Omaha men from competition.  He said the widest latitude should be given in these matters.  This view was approved by the other members of the committee, and it was directed that in the future all specifications should be so drawn as to admit Omaha bidders as well as others.</p>
                            <p>The railway trackage question was discussed again, but no action was taken, the matter being laid over for future consideration.</p>

It has demonstrated the fact that there are a very large number of people in Omaha who have more than a passing interest in this subject and that an exhibit of considerable scope and great interest could be gathered together with the material now at hand in Omaha.  There are a number of people in this city who have extensive collections, some of them of great value, and all of them of great interest to the student of ethnology.  Besides this, the number of people who know of other people who have large collections which may be obtained at little cost is simply legion.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles of the exposition has been giving this matter considerable thought recently and has formulated the outline of a plan which he thinks is promising.  His plan contemplates a congressional appropriation for an exhibit which shall be in addition to and separate from the exhibit which the Smithsonian institute and other departments of the federal government will undoubtedly make in the Government <choice><sic>biulding</sic><corr>building</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles bases his plan on the theory that the Indians are the wards of the government, and that the contemplated exhibit will be an education for the Indians, as well as for the students of Indian history and ethnology generally.  He would have the Indian exhibit covers a general review of the progress made by the Indian race since the country was first invaded by the white man, confining it almost entirely to the tribes of the transmississippi region.</p>

                            <p>"The theory of the government," said Mr. Wattles, in speaking of this matter, "is that within the next twenty-five years every Indian will be an individual land owner and be self-supporting.  To forward that plan, the government ought to take every means to educate the Indians in the arts of civilization.  The exposition will be an education for the Indians.  If representatives of every tribe are gathered here and are shown the advantages of development over the old manners of life before the white man came, there is no doubt in my mind that a powerful impression will be produced upon their minds which will go a long way toward introducing them to be more anxious to adopt that mode of life which is offered to them.</p>
                            <p>"As a secondary consideration, such an exhibit will give all those interested in the advancement of the Indian an opportunity to study the characteristics of the different tribes and, incidentally, it will be a great benefit to the exposition.  If the Indians will reproduce some of their national games and sports it will offer an opportunity, which may never come again, to thousands of people to witness performances of historic interest.</p>
                            <p>"I believe the scheme entirely practicable," said Mr. Wattles, "and I think it should be taken up and carried through.  As was suggested in The Bee, the people of the east expect to see and learn something of the Indian when they visit the west.  It is as much a part of our duty to exploit this feature of the west as it is to show our mining and agricultural resources.  A western exposition without the Indian as a prominent feature would be like that old, familiar illustration of Hamlet with Hamlet left out.  Since this matter has been agitated I find that the interest in it is really surprising and I believe the plan can be successfully carried out if it is properly organized."</p>

                            <p>The successful incorporation of the Russian-American Trade and Exposition company was celebrated last evening at the rooms of Vassily Andrejevitch Ebell at 111 South Eighteenth street, with about a dozen of the incorporators and friends present.  After a short business meeting the party adjourned to the dining room, where a genuine Russian feast was prepared.  Many dishes new to Americans were served and drinkables of all kinds&#8212;<choice><sic>Rusian</sic><corr>Russian</corr></choice>, German, French, Scotch and American&#8212;were on tap.  After these things had received their share of attention a number of impromptu toasts were responded to by those present, in which pledges of loyalty were made to the interest of the exposition, the city of Omaha, the country at large and Russia and the other slav nations.  It was a late hour before the part dispersed, but the time was all put in in a pleasant and happy manner and the Russian-American Trade and Exposition company can be fairly said to be on a firm footing for the work for which it was organized.</p>
                            <p>The occasion was a very enjoyable one and the after-dinner speeches expressed hearty sympathy with the exposition.  Mr. Ebell officiated as toastmaster, the principal speakers being Mr. Martin in German, Dr. Holovtchiner, W. F. Steecker, Mr. Scarci in Italian and A. J. Dockarty.  One of the speakers paid a high compliment to Mr. Rosewater and The Bee for promoting the interests of the exposition, the sentiments being warmly applauded by all present.</p>

                            <p>A telegram was received from F. W. Taylor of the Department of Horticulture of the exposition, announcing that the Society of American Florists, now in session at Providence, R. I., had decided by a vote of three to one, to hold the 1898 convention in this city.  The conventions of the society are attended usually by from 700 to 1,000 delegates and continue in session from five days to a week.</p>
                            <p>This convention will be the first one that the society has ever held west of the Mississippi river, and coming during the time of holding the exposition, it will be of more than usual interest, as in addition to being here themselves, the delegates and members of the society will make an exhibition of their rare flowers and shrubs.</p>

                            <p>The Council Bluffs literature committee of the Transmississippi Exposition association held yesterday afternoon in the parlors of the Grand hotel for the purpose of considering an article that had been prepared by Chairman Sawyer, presenting the claims of Council Bluffs as a convention city.  A number of important suggestions were made, and it was determined that the article should not be simply a write-up of the city, extolling its beauties and advantages, but should be an illustrated booklet giving in a condensed form statistical matter concerning the railroads, hotels, public halls and all other facts that delegates to big conventions might want to consider when selecting a location for the next meeting.</p>
                            <p>The committee will hold another meeting half an hour prior to the meetings of the executive committee in the council chamber on Thursday evening, and will formulate the report it will then make.</p>
