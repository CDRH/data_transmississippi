                            <head type="sub">An Attack of Appendicitis Which an Operation Would not Relief&#8212;His Standing in Omaha.</head>
                            <p>The Omaha World-Herald gives the following particulars of the death of Mr. Louis Bradford, who for some years previous to 1879 was in charge of the office of Weyerhaeuser &amp; Denkmann in Rock Island, resigning to go into business in Omaha.  His death was due to a short attack of appendicitis, for which an operation was performed.  The World-Herald says:</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bradford was seemingly in the best of health up to a few days ago, and his death is a shock to his friends.  Saturday afternoon Mr. Bradford left the Omaha club, suffering some pain, but still able to be about.  Sunday it was decided by his physician that an operation was necessary.  Drs. Summers, Bridges and Wilson operated on Monday, but found the case hopeless.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bradford leaves a wife and one son, Robert, also a sister, Mrs. Hall, living at Thirteenth and Vinton streets.  He has been engaged in the lumber business in Omaha since 1879, coming here from Rock Island.  Until three years ago he was a member of the Chicago Lumber Co., but since has been in business for himself at Tenth and Douglas streets.  He was considered a most capable man, is estimated to have an estate of some $75,000, and carries $18,000 life insurance in the New York Life besides other policies in other companies amounting to about $5,000.  He was a Knight Templar, a director of the Omaha Board of Trade, the junior warden of All Saint's church and a director of the Omaha club.  Beside his Omaha interests he was a member of the firm of Howland &amp; Bradford, doing a large lumber business in South Omaha.</p>
                            <p>Funeral services were held at 2 o'clock from All Saints' church, interment at Forest Lawn.</p>
                            <p>On account of the funeral of Mr. Louis Bradford these lumber dealers closed their respective places of business during Wednesday afternoon: H. F. Cady Lumber Co., C. L. Chaffee, Chicago Lumber Co., C. N. Dietz, Guiou &amp; Ledwich, Hampton Lumber Co., Geo. A. Hoagland, Wagner &amp; Buchanan, J. A. Wakefield, Wyatt-Bullard Lumber Co., Omaha; Howland &amp; Bradford, S. K. Martin Lumber Co., and J. B. Watkins &amp; Co., South Omaha.</p>

                            <p>One of the prettiest church weddings of the season was that of Miss Florence Holmes, daughter of Mrs. Lucy Holmes, of Riverdale avenue, Shelton, and Leonard Anson Davis, of Brooklyn, N. Y., which was celebrated in St. James's Episcopal church, Derby, Thursday, at 5. p. m.  The church had been most elaborately decorated for the occasion, the chancel being one beautiful tropical garden filled with stately palms of various species and Easter lilies in profusion, and in each recessed window were lilies and other plotted plants in full bloom.</p>
                            <p>The invited guests began to arrive shortly after 4 o'clock, and were ushered to their seats by Messrs. W. F. Lawrence and F. S. Valentine, of Shelton, and L. F. Anschutz and A. A. Baker, of Ansonia.  The church was quickly filled with a very fashionable company.  A few minutes past the hour and the bridal party arrived and to the strains of the familiar wedding march by Mendelssohn, rendered by Prof. Goodale, the party moved up the aisle in the following order: The ushers, followed by two little bridesmaids, the Misses Hattie and Florence Valentine, in pink organdie, bearing baskets of pink roses, and closely after them Miss Ethel Holmes and Miss Jessie Goldsmith, in pure white, bearing white marguerites.  The maid of honor, Miss Blossom May Holmes, followed, attired in a handsome costume of Persian colored silk, and immediately following her came the bride, leaning on the arm of her mother.</p>
                            <p>The bride wore a simple costume of white silk mull, trimmed only with white ribbons, and wearing as ornament a fine diamond pendant, a present from the groom.  At the chancel the party was met by the groom and his best man, Dr. Edgar Wright, of New York city, and Rev. C. E. Woodcock, of Christ church, Ansonia, stepping to meet them, the impressive service of the Episcopal church was repeated, the bride and groom responding clearly, while the organ's softest tones mingled with the solemn service.</p>
                            <p>After the benediction the procession marched down the center aisle, the bride on the arm of him she had just promised to love, honor and obey.  The bridal party were at once driven to the home of the bride's mother, where a brief informal reception was held, only the immediate relatives of the contracting parties being present.  Both bride and groom are well known here, the former being a general favorite with all the people and the latter&#8212;a native of Great Hill&#8212;has many friends here who have rejoiced at his successful efforts to carve out a career for himself in the great metropolis.</p>
                            <p>It is the verdict that he, however, never made a more surely successful move in his life than when he won his bride.  The newly-wedded couple will take up their abode in New York city, and thus once more Shelton loses by the peal of the marriage bells.</p>
                            <p>The young couple were driven to New Haven, last evening, and took the train from there to New York, thus eluding the vigilance of their friends who were lying in wait for them at the local depots.</p>

                            <note>Omaha Hotel Reporter of Sat, Jan 11th 1894</note>
                            <l>Editor OMAHA HOTEL REPORTER:</l>
                            <p>I wish to make public, at least to the hotel world, a few statements regarding the Madison Hotel affairs.  In the first place it will be well to mention, that the bungled up article that appeared in the Evening Bee of January 10, 1894, was nearly entirely lacking a word of truth in it, and I am sure the Bee does no credit to itself when such a blundering article comes forth.</p>
                            <p>Charles L. Gyger, who is simply a clerk for John A. Wakefield, is the trustee for the lien holders of the property at Twenty-first and Chicago streets, and nothing more or less, and further he does not own a dollar's worth of the Madison hotel furniture or even on the building.  The furniture is valued at about ($12,000) twelve thousand dollars and the equity is in the name of Helen A. and Sam'l A. Lewis, and there is a mortgage on it to Courtney &amp; Co., Omaha's leading grocer, for $4,500 and outside of this no one has a claim of any sort against it.</p>
                            <p>A few of the lien holders interested in this biding are some of the leading material men in Omaha, and some out of town, but there is a ring of men (which does not include the innocent parties) who I denounce as the most unscrupulous band ever <choice><sic>letf</sic><corr>left</corr></choice> at large in a civilized community, and I think it my duty to warn the widows who may be left for them to operate upon, and not let them go on victimizing any more unfortunates who may fall in with them.</p>
                            <p>John A. Wakefield and his little ring have been able to break up more than one home, and a truthful statement of facts may enlighten an ignorant public.</p>

                            <p>&#8212; The circumstances of the death of Thomas Fulton and the subsequent raising of the body to make a medical examination, are still fresh in the minds of our readers.  The following article appeared in a morning Pittsburg paper: "A suit will be filed in court this morning by R. A. and James A. Balph, attorneys for Harriet and Annie Fulton, of 76 Manhattan street, Allegheny, against the Commercial Travelers' Mutual Accident Association of America, to recover $5,000 insurance for the death of their brother, Thomas K. Fulton.  On January 1, Fulton, while walking along Pennsylvania avenue, Allegheny, fell, striking his head against a metal pipe, and died within 15 minutes.  His sisters, Annie and Harriet, sent proofs of his death to the Travelers' company.  The latter refused to settle, claiming that the death was due from heart disease and not from violence.  On April 1, the body, which was buried at New Brighton, was exhumed, and an autopsy held by physicians representing both sides.  The autopsy failed to produce evidences of heart disease, although the wounds on the head were plainly visible.  The company still refused to pay the insurance, and the suit today is to recover the full amount."</p>

                            <head>FACTORIES DAMAGED BY FLOOD</head>
                            <head type="sub">The Art Tile Works May Lose $5,000, and Other Plants Suffer&#8212;The North End In a Bad Condition.</head>
                            <p>There have been many hard rains during the past few years, and a vast amount of damage has resulted from them in this vicinity, but none of these can be compared to the rain of yesterday afternoon.  The North End, which has always had its share of the damage, is not the only place in town that felt the effects of the flood yesterday.  The property owners all along Walnut Run met with heavy losses.  The plant which suffered most in Beaver Falls was probably the Art Tile Works, situated almost on the run at the west end of Thirteenth street.  Their loss will, it is estimated, amount to almost $5,000.  The water rose so rapidly that their property could not be protected, their clay and one of the kilns being ruined by the water.</p>
                            <p>The Howard Stove Foundry also suffered greatly, and so did the other plants located on Walnut Run.  The Consolidated Mills probably contained the greatest amount of water, but their loss will not amount to much.  The Rod Mill, however, was compelled to shut down last night.  Almost all the foot bridges along the run were swept away, and a great number of outhouses were either swept away or dislodged from their foundations.  The large lot at the Knott, Harker foundry, which occupies more than a block, was completely under water.  The worst part of the flood, however, was in the North End.</p>
                            <p>From Twenty second street to the Book House it was completely immersed, and every cellar in that distance from Eighth to Ninth avenues was filled with water. street cars could not run past Twenty-second street, and at Twenty sixth street the track was badly washed out, so that several cars were derailed.  People could not leave their homes unless they went in boats or waded in water several feet deep.</p>
                            <p>About 6 o'clock, when the flood was at its worst, the culvert under the Ft. Wayne tracks, leading to Steffen's hill, was almost filled with water.</p>
                            <p>The people of the North End are again loud in their complaints about the poor protection that is given to them, but it would have been impossible to control such a quantity of water as came down Walnut Run yesterday.</p>
                            <p>It is estimated that the loss to the different works along Walnut Run, will amount to about $30,000</p>

                        <div2 type="article">
                            <p>For years there lay in my house a volume of manuscript to which I used to turn when life pressed hard and I cudgeled my brains to make out how much I would have lost had I never existed.  The pages are discolored by time and bear printer's marks in red pencil.  I treasured them, often wondering what to do with them, but made up my mind as to that when I saw the Mertz musical collection in the Pittsburg Carnegie library.  I would have them bound and put them with that, first as the memorials of two as good men as ever walked the earth, William Hunter and Samuel Wakefield, both Methodist itinerants, and second as showing how they went about it to teach the people of this region to love music and song, for these are the pages of the "Minstrel of Zion," the text by Hunter and the quaint notes by Wakefield.  They say in the preface that they sought the simple rather than the sublime, because (with characteristic modesty) "if the authors had been capable of producing a work adapted throughout to the taste of the critic, it might have failed of their design, as being too far in advance of ordinary taste."  It was copyrighted in Pittsburg early in 1845, but many of the pieces in it and the music for them had been composed long before that.  Here is one, "The Old Ship of Zion, Rebuilt." Who the author was perhaps no one now knows, as it was one of the spiritual songs sung by Methodists and others far back in the century.  It was recast, or according to his Country Antrim drollery, "rebuilt," by Hunter, likely as not in the 30s.  It is crowded with references to the sea, which seem to indicate that it was written when immigrants were coming fast and had fresh memories of the sea.  It is in parts, for women and men, and recalls the days when they sat apart in worship.  The women pipe out:</p>
                            <l>Come, tell of your vessel and what is her name,</l>
                            <l>Oh, happy Christian sailors.</l>
                            <l>Say who is your captain and what is his fame,</l>
                            <l>Oh, happy Christian sailors.</l>
                            <p>The men lift up their voices and roar in chorus:</p>
                            <l>She's the old ship of Zion,</l>

                            <head>BEAVER VALLEY FLOODED.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Storm Was Terrific and Caused Damage of About $20,000&#8212;Several Narrow Escapes.</head>
                            <p>Beaver Falls, Pa., June 7.&#8212;One of the most severe rain and electric storms for years occurred here about 2 o'clock this afternoon, the lightning striking at a number of places, but no fatalities are reported.  The rain continued from 2 to 7 o'clock and resembled a cloudburst.  Walnut run overflowed its banks and the north end was inundated, many families being driven to the upper stories of their houses.  Cellars were filled and streets and pavements torn up by the rushing water while many gardens are destroyed.  The people are going about on rafts and in boats aiding each other in their distress.</p>
                            <p>At Fifth street, in the lower end of town, a number of houses are surrounded by water and it is feared that the culvert through which the run passes at that point will become clogged and cause the water to overflow the entire lower end of town.</p>
                            <p>In the North end a young woman was saved from drowning by several men.  She was in an outhouse when a large body of water came down with a rush, upsetting the little building and precipitating her into several feet of swiftly running water.  Her perilous situation was seen by several men and she was rescued.</p>
                            <p>The damage to the consolidated steel plant will be considerable, as also to Knott &amp; Harker, founders and machinists, and other factories along the run.  Reports from the country districts are that great damage has been done by the washing of fields, carrying away of bridges, etc.</p>
                            <p>New Brighton, Pa., June 7.&#8212;The storm here to-day flooded the Block House run district, which runs along the eastern edge of town and comprises the manufacturing district.  At 5 o'clock the waters were rising at the rate of a foot a minute.  The sewer pipe works of the Pittsburg Clay Manufacturing company, which come first in their path, had $10,000 worth of property swept away.  Cars on the siding were swept before the flood; $4,000 worth of sewer pipe piled on the grounds went down in the torrent; their sheds and wagons were carried away, and several car loads of lumber.</p>
                            <p>T. D. Brown, the superintendent of the works, narrowly escaped drowning and was pulled out by ropes.  Mrs. McCleland, who was driving along the valley road, narrowly escaped being washed away.  A horse and buggy belonging to J. W. Beacom was carried down the stream a mile.  A small store room belonging to Samuel Smith was lifted from its foundation and dashed to pieces.  The railroad bridge on the run switch of the Pennsylvania company was swept away.</p>
                            <p>Lower down the stream a wareroom of the Dawes and Myler bath tub factory was picked up, carried 100 rods and smashed to splinters.  It contained about $2,000 worth of ware ready to ship.  The water reached their enamelling rooms and destroyed a large quantity of enamelling powders.  A wagon bridge in front of the Sherwood  Bros. pottery was carried away.  O. H. Couch's barns went down, the horses and cattle being saved by the greatest exertion.</p>
                            <p>The Atlantic Refining company's offices were wholly wrecked and Thomas Richards’s green house ruined.  The coal yards of Orlando Couch were flooded and his sheds with 1,000 or more bushels of coal carried off.</p>
                            <p>The Beaver Valley Traction company's lines were washed out at a number of points and traffic stopped for several hours.</p>
                            <p>Washouts at Monaca delayed Pittsburg and Lake Erie trains for several hours, and Pennsylvania company trains were held at various points.  The entire damage in the valley is <unclear/> at $20,000.</p>

                            <head type="sub">THE BLOCK HOUSE VAPPEY SWEPT BY A FLOOD OF WILD WATER.</head>
                            <head type="sub">The Raging Torrent Sweeps Everything Before it&#8212;A Horse Carried a Quarter of a Mile&#8212;A House Completely Demolished&#8212;The Railroad Company and Manufacturers Lose Thousands of Dollars.</head>
                            <p>The awful rainstorm which burst upon the town yesterday afternoon caused a loss of thousands of dollars.</p>
                            <p>The factories and railroad company were the heavy losers.  The scene up Block House run this morning was one of desolation and devastation.  Houses and stables are wrecked, roadways are washed away and wreckage and debris is piled up dozens of feet high.  The NEWS reporter traversed the valley from the Sewer Pipe Works to Third avenue this morning.  On all sides there are ruins and property laid waste.  The flood was at its worst after 4 o'clock and as soon as debris began to float, it clogged the railroad bridges and made the volume of the water greater.</p>
                            <p>The Sewer Pipe Works was the first plant to suffer.  Hundreds of pipes were carried down the stream and destroyed.  The railroad track was undermined and the rails and ties sank with cars on them.  A house which stood just below the office and was unoccupied, was picked up and washed down stream.  Not enough of it was left to know that it ever was a house.  A stable at the plant, in which a horse and buggy belonging to J. W. Beacom was standing, was taken from its foundation and crushed into a mass of timber.  It was totally demolished but the horse and buggy floated on.  The horse struggled in the roaring torrent and became detached from the buggy a few hundred feet below the factory.  The vehicle was twisted out of shape.  The unfortunate animal was tossed wildly down the run as far as the American Porcelain Works, over a quarter of a mile from where it started.  Here three young men named Jackson, Huffman and Thomas rescued it.  This morning it died from its injuries.  A long platform built over the run at the Sewer Pipe Works, was demolished and the ware carried away.</p>
                            <p>At the Dawes &amp; Myler plant a shed containing ware ready for shipment stood on the Run banks.  It was washed away and piled up at the trestle.  The ware was washed down stream.  A stable at the Atlantic Refining Company’s plant was removed to another location.  A car load of cement which was to be used in constructing the new county bridge at 13th street, was washed away.  The greenhouse of T. W. Richards was covered with rushing water and much damage resulted.  Six feet of water covered the low part of O. H. Couch's property, wagons, etc., being submerged.</p>
                            <p>An iron wagon bridge near the office of the E.S. &amp; B pottery was washed out and doubled up like a jack knife, shoved under the railroad bridge and carried to the Enterprise pottery, a distance of about six squares.  A vegetable garden belonging to Mrs. Snyder, opposite the works, is covered with a coating of broken pottery and flower pots.  It is ruined.  About 100 feet of track is washed out between the Sherwood Bros. pottery and Warren Soap Works.  At the latter place a big building was undermined and fell into the run.</p>
                            <p>At the Enterprise pottery works a wagon bridge was washed away, not a vestige of it remaining.  A part of the new stone arch recently built by the County Commissioners over the run on lower Third avenue, at a cost of $3,500, was washed out.  It was the lower part, and was wrecked by the eddying waters undermining the foundation.  The lower part of the arch crashed into the run about 10,30 o'clock at night.  Street cars transferred today.  The rushing water being unable to get through the arch, overflowed the banks, and inundated the lands lying on lower Third avenue, below the arch. The place was a sea of water today.  Commissioners Carey, Harton and Freed were at the scene today, and said that it would take $1,000 to repair the damage.</p>
                            <p>A large slide took place on the P. &amp; L. E. road opposite this place last night about 9:30 o'clock.  Workmen blasted the rock today and traffic was not long delayed.</p>
                            <p>The damage up the run falls heaviest on the Pittsburg Clay Manufacturing Company, the railroad company and Dawes &amp; Myler.  Messrs. Elverson and Brown, of the first named company, could not estimate the loss this morning.  They said it was impossible to make any calculation and probably never would know just how much they lost.  It will be up in the thousands.  The railroad company will have to find a new road bed in many places and will have to spend a few thousand.  The loss at Dawes &amp; Myler's will reach $2,000.</p>
                            <p>The factories have encroached on the run bed to such an extent that the water had not room enough to get out without overflowing its banks and creating havoc.  Block House run gets wild at times and must have more room.  At least two thousand persons walked up the run today, climbing over the lop-sided railway tracks, and over piles of debris, to see the sights.  Hundreds of men were working in the wreckage.

                            <head type="sub">Fall of Babylon, Depicting a Scene at the Feast of Belshazzar Has Already Been Secured.</head>
                            <p>The securing of an art exhibit for the Transmississippi Exposition has been commenced.  Art Director Griffith reporting to the Department of Exhibits that he has secured two valuable paintings for the exhibit.</p>
                            <p>One of these pictures is a work which has never been shown in the United States, and has been shown but once on the American continent.  This was in Toronto in 1878, and the picture created such a furore and such a storm of objections was raised to its exhibition that it was removed, and has been stored in New York City since that time.  The picture is called "The Fall of Babylon," and depicts a scene at the famous feats of Belshazzar when the city was destroyed.  It is oriental in its richness, and at the time of its exhibition in Toronto, it was said by critics to have been one of the finest examples of historic representation ever shown.  The painting is about fifty feet in width and about twenty feet high.  It is valued at $80,000.</p>
                            <p>The famous painting was brought over from the continent by Mr. Griffith in 1878, and was exhibited in Toronto under the auspices of a local art association.  Its exhibition caused a great ruction among the directors of the association, and one of the directors resigned in anger after unsuccessfully endeavoring to prevent the display of the picture.  The general public took up the discussion, and it finally became necessary to close the exhibition on account of the adverse criticism.  Since that time public opinion has changed somewhat and Mr. Griffith anticipates that no serious objections will be made to the picture, which he regards as one of the finest paintings in the world.</p>
                            <p>The other picture which has been secured by Mr. Griffith is called "Die Flagelletten," (the Whipping), and is the work of Carl Marr, a celebrated German artist.  This picture is stored in Milwaukee.</p>

                            <head type="sub">CHANGE LOCATION OF BUILDINGS.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Structure for Liberal Arts Will Displace the Auditorium.</head>
                            <p>The arrangement of the buildings on the main court of the exposition will be changed somewhat from the plan originally adopted in order to meet the growing demand on the part of the Department of Exhibits for more space in the Manufactures building.  This demand, coupled with the fact that the bids for the construction of the Auditorium greatly exceeded the limit of cost fixed by the executive committee, operated to cause a change to be made which will add another building to those to be erected for housing the exposition.  This building will be known as the Liberal Arts building.  In order to accommodate it on the main court and place it near the Manufactures building, of which it will properly be an annex, it was decided by the executive committee at a meeting held yesterday afternoon to place the Liberal Arts building on the site assigned to the Art building, directly west of the Manufactures building and but a few feet from it.  This necessitated the selection of a new site for the Art building and it was decided by the committee to reject all bids for the construction of the Auditorium building and locate the Art building on the site formerly assigned to the Auditorium.</p>
                            <p>The Liberal Arts building will be 130x240 feet in size and will cost $25,000.  The plans for the new building will be drawn by Fisher &amp; Lawrie, and it has been agreed that the plans and working drawings shall be completed by them before September 20.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater reported on the railway matter, which had been referred to a committee consisting of Mr. Rosewater and Superintendent Owens of the Department of Transportation.  He stated that the exposition could lay its own tracks on the grounds and operate them by electric power.  The cost of construction would be less than $6,000 and the material would sell for almost its cost after the exposition is over.  Mr. Owens had estimated that the exposition could handle the cars at a much less rate than the Missouri Pacific proposes to charge and save money by the operation.  He had secured estimated of the cost on a trolley car of twenty-horse power and the cost of power.  By this means Mr. Rosewater said either the Elkhorn or the Missouri Pacific could land cars in the grounds and the handling of the cars would be entirely in the hands of the exposition management.</p>
                            <p>No action was taken on the matter, it being deferred until further consideration was given to it.</p>

                            <p>Before leaving for the east Foo said he would have thirty Chinese artisans in Omaha by October 1, and would put them at work constructing the pagoda which is to form the center of the Chinese exhibit.  He said that instead of bringing the materials from China, with which to construct the building, he would use American materials and would construct a building costing $25,000.

                            <head type="sub">Will Examine Into Missouri Pacific Contract with Exposition.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition held a meeting at the Commercial club rooms at noon today to take up the question of trackage facilities on the exposition grounds.  In addition to the report made yesterday by Mr. Rosewater a telegram was received from Manager Babcock to the effect that whenever the Missouri Pacific presented a contract drawn in accordance with the understanding had between himself and the Missouri Pacific officials the contract should be executed.</p>
                            <p>The contract which had, up to this time, never been before the committee, was presented, together with a letter relating to it, from C. S. Montgomery, general counsel for the exposition.  Mr. Montgomery stated that, as drawn, the contract gives the Missouri Pacific exclusive control over the tracks inside the exposition grounds and gave the exposition no control whatever over the tracks or the handling of cars on the tracks.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield, in glancing over the contract, read one section for the information of the committee, in which it was provided that the Missouri Pacific should have the right to use the tracks inside the exposition grounds for the use of itself or its patrons, "whenever, in the opinion of the superintendent of the Missouri Pacific road, such use would not interfere with the use of such tracks for exposition purposes."  This clause seemed to be rather surprising to the members of the executive committee and to throw more light on the letter of the corporation counsel.  Considerable discussion ensued as to how the interests of the exposition were to be protected in the absence of an experienced railroad man on the committee.  It was finally decided to call upon Commissioner Utt of the Commercial club for assistance and the whole matter was turned over to him for examination.  The question will be taken up at a later date.</p>
                            <p>It was decided that the proposition submitted by Commissioner Powell of Mexico, whereby it was proposed to secure the attendance of the Mexican National Military band at the exposition, on condition that the Mexican government makes an exhibit, was accepted and Commissioner Powell will be instructed to close his negotiations with the Mexican government.  The band will be here during a part of the time the exposition is open and will furnish some of the music.</p>

                            <p>MADISON, Wis., Aug. 19.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The Wisconsin legislature this evening adopted a joint resolution heartily approving the Transmississippi Exposition and authorizing Governor Scofield to address a proclamation to commercial organizations and manufacturers throughout the state, urging them to prepare suitable exhibits, showing the resources and products of Wisconsin.  Walter W. Pollock, the commercial agent for the exposition for Wisconsin, found upon arrival in Madison yesterday that it would be impossible to secure an appropriation from the state, owing to a strong objection on the part of legislators to the introduction of new business and the fact that a three-fourths vote of both houses would be necessary to permit the <choice><sic>introductioon</sic><corr>introduction</corr></choice> of a bill for an appropriation.  It was, therefore, decided to take advantage of the friendly disposition of the governor and legislators toward the exposition and the resolution passed without a dissenting vote.  The governor's proclamation will suggest the organization of an association to solicit voluntary subscriptions to a fund for a state building.  It is believed that the materials for the building can be secured by donations from lumbermen and stone quarry concerns.  The state officials have partially promised to lend "Old Abe," the famous Wisconsin eagle, for a part of the proposed historical exhibit.</p>

                            <p>R. E. Sherman, the inventor of the umbrella which will be the prominent engineering novelty of the exposition, has notified the Department of Concessions that he will be in Omaha before September 1, prepared to commence active work on his machine.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Sherman was notified by the department some time ago that he must furnish satisfactory proof that his machine would be absolutely safe and feasible before he would be granted the concession for its erection or allowed to do anything toward putting it up.  Since that time, Mr. Sherman has furnished certificates from two civil engineers of recognized standing in the profession, to the effect that the plane for the machine contemplated a contrivance which will be perfectly stable and safe and thoroughly practical.  In addition to this, the department has submitted the plans to the inspection of other competent engineers and has received assurance that the project is practically safe.</p>

The standard of the machine, or the stick of the umbrella, will be a steel cylinder forty-five feet in diameter and reaching a point 350 feet above the ground.  The lower end of the cylinder will rest on a solid foundation many feet below the surface of the bluff.  The ribs of the umbrella will each carry a car capable of holding twenty people, and the diameter of the circle when the cars are raised will be 275 feet.  When the umbrella is raised the cars will be turned slowly around in a circle so that the passengers may survey the entire horizon before descending again to earth.</p>
                            <p>The erection of this gigantic umbrella will cost about $80,000 and will require a great amount of mechanical work.  Its erection will be under the direct supervision of Inventor Sherman.</p>

                            <p>The meeting of the executive committee of the Council Bluffs Exposition association at Council Bluffs last evening was lightly attended.  There were present, however, members of all of the subcommittees, and reports were received from several of them.  Chairman Test of the transportation committee presented two resolutions which his committee asked the general association to adopt.  One was a request for the committee on literature to furnish his committee with a short article on Council Bluffs, its hotels and resorts, parks and advantages and its convenience and accessibility to the exposition grounds.  Chairman Test explained that his committee desired to use such an article at once.  As this article was on the line of one that the literature committee had already drafted it was acceptable to the members of the committee and was approved by the association.  The other resolution was as follows:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That we request the general committee of fifty to invite the Merchants' and Manufacturers' association, the Business Men's association, the public officers, the fraternal societies, the workingmen's associations, the railroad men's associations, the women's clubs and the women of the city and all other well disposed citizens of Council Bluffs and Pottawattamie county to co-operate in the work of the Transmississippi association.</p>
                            <p>The resolution was adopted and the secretary instructed to issue the invitations called for.</p>
                            <p>The committee on exhibits reported that it had taken the initial steps in the work assigned.  It had decided that the fruit exhibit was to be the chief thing undertaken and had planned the work of the committee to interest at once the largest possible number of fruit growers and secure the finest specimens of all kinds of fruits that ripen in the autumn.  The discussion of the report indicated that it was the opinion of all present that the energies of the association should be directed to the preparation of a magnificent fruit exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Barrett of the literature committee reported that the members had the work well in hand, and the committee was about ready to turn off the results of its first assignment.  Suggestions were called for from the association concerning several points upon which the members were undecided, and a number were given.</p>
                            <p>The special committee appointed to secure a location for permanent headquarters for the association reported that it had examined several rooms and had received some propositions.  The most favorable of these came from Mr. Clark of the Grand hotel.  The next general meeting was fixed for Thursday evening at 8:30.</p>

                            <p>The Board of Directors of the exposition will meet in adjourned session at 4 o'clock this afternoon if enough members of the directory can be found to make a quorum.  It is probable that one of the things done will be to change the rules in such a way as to provide that less than a majority of the directors shall constitute a quorum to do business.  Several adjournments have been taken because a majority of the directors could not be found and several of the members who attend all the meetings have expressed themselves very strongly to the effect that those who avoid the meetings as much as possible should resign and allow their places to be filled with men who will attend to the business of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>One of the matters which will probably be given attention will be the filling of the vacancy caused by the death of Dan Farrell, jr.  There are several candidates for this vacancy, the most active being County Commissioner Thomas Hoctor.  Each time a vacancy has occurred on the board the South Omaha people have insisted that they should be given the place, but a man from Omaha has been chosen each time.  This time the South Omaha people say they are determined to be ignored no longer and will insist that they be recognized.</p>

                            <p>The exposition directory held an adjourned meeting yesterday with twenty-six members present.  Thomas Hoctor of South Omaha was elected to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Dan Farrell, jr., and the railway trackage and water supply questions were fully discussed.</p>
                            <p>When the meeting was ready for business Allen Rector called attention to the death of Mr. Farrell, and moved the appointment of a special committee of three to prepare suitable resolutions.  A motion to that effect was carried, and the president appointed Messrs. Rector, Wharton and Saunders, who will report at a subsequent meeting of the board.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles said the next business would be the election of a man to fill this vacancy.</p>
                            <p>C. F. Weller placed Clement Chase in nomination.</p>
                            <p>A. H. Noyes said considerable dissatisfaction had existed in South Omaha because a resident of that city had not been elected as a director when former vacancies had occurred.  He placed Thomas Hoctor in nomination.</p>
                            <p>F. M. Youngs nominated William H. Bell, president of the Central Labor union, as the representative of organized labor.</p>
                            <p>The president appointed Messrs. Yost and Lee as tellers.</p>
                            <p>While the vote was being counted General Manderson asked for the information on the subject of water for the lagoon.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles said negotiations were pending with the Omaha Water company for supplying water on terms favorable to the exposition, but final arrangements could not be made until the litigation in the courts is ended.  He said figures are now being obtained for pipe.</p>
                            <p>General Manderson wanted to know if the artesian well was a success or a failure.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles said it was a success, giving a flow of about forty-five gallons per minute.  He said it was the intention to put an air lift in the well, which would increase the volume to about 250 gallons per minute.</p>
                            <p>In response to another question Mr. Wattles said the well had cost about $3,500.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wharton said the Park board had agreed to take the well contract off the hands of the exposition and pay for it.  He declared most emphatically that the well was a good one and would answer fully for park purposes.  He said he had overheard some one remark that the well contract was the most foolish contract ever heard of.  He refuted this assertion, and said the Park board intended to put an air lift in the well.</p>
                            <p>The well was then dropped and Mr. Wharton introduced an amendment to the by-laws providing that a quorum of the board should be fifteen members.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kountze thought fifteen was too small a number and amended by making twenty constitute a quorum.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                                <head type="sub">TOM HOCTOR WINS OUT.</head>
                                <p>At this point the tellers reported on the ballot for a director to succeed Mr. Farrell as follows: Chase 5, Bell 1, Hoctor 17.  Mr. Hoctor was declared elected and Mr. Noyes escorted him into the room, where he took his seat amid applause.</p>
                                <p>General Manderson opposed any change in the by-laws.  He said he thought that since the summer vacation was over a majority of members might be obtained.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Wharton favored reducing the quorum so that those interested enough to attend should not have their hands tied.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Lindsey favored changing the by-laws to provide that any director failing to attend two consecutive meetings might be dropped from the directory.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Korty offered a substitute in writing, which he had drawn up.  It was along the same lines as Mr. Lindsey's suggestion, making sickness or absence from the city sufficient excuses for absence.</p>
                                <p>The substitute was adopted without a dissenting vote, Mr. Wharton calling attention to the fact that it did not make any real change in the by-laws.</p>
                                <p>By this time Dion Geraldine, superintendent of construction, had come into the room, and President Wattles called on him for a statement regarding the artesian well.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Geraldine said the well had cost within a few dollars of $4,500, and has a flow on the level of the lagoon of fifty gallons per minute.  He said it was the intention to use an air lift, which might increase the flow to 100 or 200 gallons per minute.  He said it could not be told definitely what the result of an air lift would be.  Mr. Geraldine said further that the well had not been "shot" for the purpose of increasing the flow, but simply to increase the capacity&#8212;making a reservoir at the bottom of the well so that the water would flow in rapidly when it was pumped out.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Rosewater then asked Mr. Geraldine for a statement regarding the railway trackage on the grounds and regarding the rate that should be charged for shifting cars.  Mr. Rosewater said he wanted an expression of opinion from the directors on this matter.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Geraldine said he would not like to make a statement unless he was allowed to go into detail on the history of the whole matter.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Manderson expressed the hope that the whole matter should be thoroughly discussed and said that he hoped there would be no disposition to throttle debate or cover up any matter in which the directory was interested.  He made extended remarks along that line, and said the duty of the board was to protect the interests of the exposition and it would only do this by knowing the full details.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                                <head type="sub">GERALDINE ON THE CARPET.</head>
                                <p>Mr. Geraldine then made a statement.  He said that the water question was a serious one.  If the water could be secured from the water company on favorable terms that was undoubtedly the best thing to do.  If that could not be accomplished, he said water could be secured from Cut Off lake; or, if the owners of that property objected, then water could be drawn from the river at a maximum cost of $11,000.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Geraldine then went into an exhaustive statement regarding the railway question.  He said when he first advised that the site might be changed he had been assured that the right of way for the Elkhorn to cross the Missouri Pacific tracks had been secured.  Afterward it had developed that this right had not been secured, and the Elkhorn had notified him that they would not attempt to enter the grounds.  Later, he said, the whole matter had been turned over to Mr. Babcock and an agreement reached between Mr. Babcock and the Missouri Pacific for a terminal charge of $4 per car.  Mr. Geraldine said it was untrue that the contract had been in his possession two weeks, as had been stated in the newspapers.  He said it was returned to the Missouri Pacific by Mr. Babcock for correction and had been returned by the railway company.  He said that on account of Mr. Babcock's office being closed the contract was left in the speaker's office and was turned over by him the same day to Mr. Babcock's representative.  He also recounted the events of recent occurrence, taking occasion several times to slap at the newspapers for making what he characterized as reports which were "absolutely untrue."</p>
                                <p>In reply to a question by General Manderson, Mr. Geraldine stated that the contract, as now drawn, complies substantially with the suggestion of Mr. Babcock.</p>
                                <p>A question by Mr. Kountze elicited the statement that the World's fair management laid its own tracks and made a terminal charge of $2 per car.</p>
                                <p>At the conclusion of his remarks Mr. Rosewater said he only wished to say that so far as the statement of Mr. Geraldine, regarding alleged misstatements in the newspapers
                                
                                <pb n="14" xml:id="TMISB03-014"/>
                                
                                to the effect that he had held the railway contract two weeks, were concerned, that the information on which this statement was based came from the Transportation department, and the truth of the statement rested between Mr. Geraldine and that department.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                                <head type="sub">TERMINAL CHARGE EXCESSIVE.</head>
                                <p>Mr. Rosewater then took up the railway trackage matter. He said this was a vital question and one in which the exposition had a great interest.  He discussed the proposed terminal charge of $4 and showed that it was higher than corresponding distances in other parts of the city.  Mr. Rosewater said further that the estimated cost of construction as figured by Missouri Pacific were excessive.  He outlined the proposition for the exposition to construct the tracks and use electric power, which was discussed by the executive committee.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Manderson said the directors were not experts and could never settle the matter, and he moved that the whole question be referred to the executive committee with the request that the committee call in Messrs. Dickinson, Holdrege and Bidwell, general managers respectively of the Union Pacific, Burlington and Elkhorn roads.</p>
                                <p>This motion was adopted and the board adjourned to go into executive session with the executive committee regarding matters connected with the exposition.</p>

                            <p>The question of railway facilities on the exposition grounds will probably not be settled until some time next week.  No action could be taken today because there is not a quorum of the executive committee in the city.  There has been but a bare quorum of the committee for over a week, and last night Manager Bruce was called out of the city, leaving the committee without a quorum.  General Manager Dickinson of the Union Pacific is also out of the city.  He is expected to return Monday.

                            <p>Lewis W.

He said the mineral resources of Utah would probably form a prominent feature of the exhibit, and that the agricultural resources would not be neglected, material for that portion of the exhibit being now collected from all parts of the state.

                            <head type="sub">Produces Records to Sustain His Previous Statements.</head>
                            <p>Superintendent Owens of the Department of Transportation expressed considerable indignation when he read the report of the statement made at the meeting of the Board of Directors by D. Geraldine, denying that he (Geraldine) had held the Missouri Pacific contract two weeks before turning it over to the Department of Transportation.  Mr. Owens said he was prepared to substantiate his statements that Mr. Geraldine had held that contract two weeks as had been stated, and he referred to his letter books for proof of what he said.</p>
                            <p>"There is another matter about which Mr. Geraldine seems to be mistaken," continued Mr. Owens, turning to a large folio containing a number of circulars issued by various railroads.  "Here is a circular," said he, picking up one of them, "which was issued by the Illinois Central railroad.  It is dated June 29, 1891, and states that the rate for material switched from the tracks of the Illinois Central to the tracks of the exposition will be $1 per car on and after the date of the circular.  It states, in so many words, that this charge of $1 per car is 'to cover all charges for services rendered by the exposition management on its own tracks and with its own engines.'  That doesn't look as though the charge was $2 per car, as stated by Mr. Geraldine, does it?"</p>

                            <p>President Tukey of the Board of Park Commissioners says that the people who regard the artesian well on the exposition grounds as a waste of money do not know what they are talking about.  He says:</p>
                            <p>"The artesian wells have solved the question of water for lakes in the municipal parks  which could not have been settled in any other way.  The well at the exposition grounds will furnish an ample supply for the permanent lake and this is worth much more than the amount expended even if the flow is not adequate for exposition purposes.  The flow would continue for as many years in the future as anyone would care to look, and the cost of the well would be saved a hundred times over.  The first cost of the well represents practically the entire expense of the water supply for the lake, when if the water was purchased from the water company the cost would be enormous.  Even the small amount of water that is required to keep the ice in Hanscom park in condition for skating costs the board upwards of $500 every winter, and if the board had to buy all the water for a lake in each park it would cost thousands of dollars every year."</p>

                            <head type="sub">PREPARE COATING FOR THE EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">First Work of Putting Staff in Position Will Be Begun This Week on the Administration Building.</head>
                            <p>The work of modeling the artistic creations which are to grace the buildings on the main court of the Transmississippi and International Exposition is now well under way and the operation of casting the staff from these models will be commenced this week.  Up to this time two firms have been awarded contracts for the staff work of these main buildings, viz: The Artistic Stucco and Modeling company, and Smith &amp; Eastman, both being Chicago firms.  The former firm has already started the active work of making the models, and the other contractors have
                            
                            <pb n="15" xml:id="TMISB03-015"/>
                            
                            almost completed the erection of their building.</p>
                            <p>The active head of the Artistic Stucco and Modeling company is Leo Bonet, one of the best known workers in stucco in this country.  Mr. Bonet did a large amount of the staff work on the World's fair buildings, among the buildings which he decorated being the Woman's building, Mines, Electricity and Horticultural buildings, and the French section in the Manufactures building, one of the most elaborate and beautiful spots on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bonet has secured the contract for the Administration building, and the work will all be done under his immediate supervision.  He has erected a workship on the north side of the brick building on the bluff tract, at Sherman avenue and Manderson street, and has several men at work making models from the drawings furnished by the architects.</p>
                            <p>The ornamental portions of the staff work must be cast and "set" before being placed in position on the building of which they are to form a part.  The flat surfaces may either be laid on after the manner of ordinary plaster, or molded in large slabs and nailed on like so much lumber.  Mr. Bonet states that the former method is far preferable for several reasons, and is the method he will adopt in the case of the Administration building.  He says that the plan of molding the flat surfaces and fastening them in place after they are dried is only necessary when it is desired to proceed with the construction regardless of the outside temperature.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">FIRST WORK THIS WEEK.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Bonet says he will commence work directly on the Administration building the latter part of this week.  The first point attacked will be the interior arch beneath which visitors to the exposition will pass to reach the old fair grounds tract.  The upper portion of this arch will be elaborately decorated and the stucco for this decoration will be made right on the spot and put in place before it is dry.  For this purpose a temporary work shop will be established in the building and this will give visitors an opportunity of seeing just how it is done.  The exterior staff work on this building will not be commenced until the carpenters are through with the erection of the frame work, as a blow from a piece of timber would destroy the work of several days.  The interior work will require the time of several workmen for two or three weeks, and this work may be done while the carpenters are completing their part of the work.</p>
                            <p>The making of models for the many columns and other forms of decoration which will be required on this building has been going on for the past week in the workshop on the bluff tract.  The greater part of this work has been done by G. Prano, an expert modeller and sculptor who has been with Mr. Bonet for the past ten years.  He is the foreman of the work and has full charge during the absence of his chief.</p>
                            <p>A large number of columns and brackets of the same size are required to complete the building and for these plaster models are made in order to secure a mold in which as many may be made as desired.  In making these models "hard wall plaster," such as is used for the final coating in buildings, is used and the plastic material is skillfully manipulated by the workmen while it is "setting" until a finished model of pure white is produced which assumes the hardness of stone when it is entirely dried.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MAKING MODELS OF CLAY.</head>
                            <p>In the case of the capitals and brackets which are formed of conventionalized ornaments, such as leaves, etc., the model is made of clay.  In the case, for instance, of a large bracket which is to form a part of the ornamentation near the top of the Administration building, the model was made yesterday by Mr. Bonet.  A heavy board, longer and wider than the bracket would be when finished, was placed in a slanting position and a large lump of clay was placed on it.  With the hands it was formed rudely into the general shape of the bracket and then with modeling tools it was finished in detail.  Owing to the distance of the bracket from the ground when in place it was molded along strong lines with bold strokes of the modeling tools.  When completed the clay model was placed to one side to dry.  When dried it will be covered with a coating of shellac varnish and a mold will be made from it in which will be cast the staff brackets which are to be placed on the building.</p>
                            <p>An ornamental capital for a Corinthian was made in the same way.  It may interest molders in metal to know that in this stucco work it is not necessary to avoid "undercuts" as in metal, but the desired effect is obtained, regardless of forms which would be impossible to cast in metal on account of undercuts which would necessitate so many sections in the mold as to be impracticable.  This is explained by the character of the material from which the molds for casting staff are made.  These molds are made of gelatine mixed with glue, giving a pliable mold of sufficient firmness to give form to the stucco, but with enough elasticity to allow it to be drawn away from the hardened stucco without injuring the cast.</p>
                            <p>The establishment of this stucco working in Omaha has resulted in developing Nebraska's fertile resources in a most unexpected direction, and adds another to the already long list of supplies of various kinds which are to be found within the borders of the state.  The modeling of the intricate artistic forms required for the finer decoration requires the use of modeling clay in very large quantities, and the question of supplying this material promised to be a serious one.  If brought from the east the material would cost several dollars per barrel and would form a most important issue in determining the cost of the work.  Before ordering any clay from the eastern supply houses, Mr. Bonet determined to do a little investigating.  Securing a team and a local resident who was familiar with the country along the river banks, Mr. Bonet started up the river from Ames avenue, looking for a clay which should be free from grit and fine enough, when dry, to form a smooth surface.  The mud in the river bottom was tried, and several samples of clay taken from the banks along the river were examined, but none of these proved satisfactory.  The trip extended for some distance up the river, but with no satisfactory result.  Then a trip down the river was tried and the bend of the stream beyond East Omaha was followed.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GUMBO USED FOR MODELS.</head>
                            <p>Near the East Omaha bridge the driver made a detour to avoid a large bed of "gumbo."  When asked the reason of this divergence from the river bank, the driver informed Mr. Bonet that it was to avoid getting into the gumbo, which would stick to the vehicle and the horses' feet.</p>
                            <p>"Let me see that 'gumbo,'" exclaimed Mr. Bonet quickly.</p>
                            <p>The driver stopped his team with an expression of disgust for the "infernal stuff," and Mr. Bonet leaped from the vehicle.  Picking up a lump of the clay which was moist, he worked it with his fingers, smelled of it, broke it up and tested it in numerous other ways.</p>
                            <p>"This is just the thing!  Excellent!" exclaimed Mr. Bonet with delight.  "We need look no further; this will make the very best modeling clay."</p>
                            <p>They returned to the city and Mr. Bonet at once ordered a wagon load of the despised gumbo to be put in his shop.  Here he instructed a laborer how to mix the clay and the result was a material which he says is equal to the best modeling clay to be had anywhere west of New York.</p>
                            <p>The clay is hauled to the shop for the price of the hauling, and here it is wet with water from the Missouri river, then a stout man with a club pounds it and kneads it, after which it is laid in the sun to dry, and then it is put through another course of kneading until it has the consistency of putty and is perfectly smooth to the touch and free from grit.</p>

                            <head type="sub">NEBRASKA EXHIBIT AT THE EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Counties of the State Preparing to Make a Great Show Nest Year&#8212;Applications for Space.</head>
                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission will hold a regular meeting this afternoon at its headquarters in the Manderson block, and will remain in session until some time tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>There are two or three important matters which will engage the attention of the commission.  The principal thing will be to outline the policy to be pursued regarding county exhibits.  Assistant Secretary Dearing has a large number of letters from the officers of the several county agricultural societies regarding the amount of space which they would like and the conditions which should govern the exhibits.  These will be laid before the commission and some plan will probably be adopted.  The bulk of these letters are to the effect that if the necessary space for an exhibit in the Agriculture buildings supplied, the counties will fill the space and furnish men to keep the exhibit in order.</p>
                            <p>The letter received from Platte county is a fair sample of the majority of the letters.  This states that the Platte county will not hold a county fair this year, but will save money and make a good showing at the exposition, the farmers of that county now being engaged in gathering materials for this exhibit.  The state commission is asked to provide space for the exhibit, the letter stating that floor space about 20x20 feet will be required.  This county proposes to furnish a man to take care of the exhibit during the exposition and to distribute advertising matter.</p>
                            <p>Assistant Secretary Dearing says that the replied indicate that about forty counties will make exhibits and that the average space required for each county will be 500 feet, making a total space of 2,000.  He also says that it does not seem to be necessary for the commission to offer any premiums for the best county exhibits, as the counties which propose to make exhibits are enterprising enough to do so without the incentive of premiums, provided space is furnished free to the counties.</p>
                            <p>Some of the members of the commission coincide with the assistant secretary in this view and regard it as a most economical solution of a perplexing question.</p>
                            <p>Another matter which will engage the attention of the commission will be the State building.  The plans and working drawings of this building are about completed and these will be laid before the board for approval.  It is probable that the superintendent <unclear/> be instructed to invite bids for the material necessary in the construction of the building.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles will meet with the commission tonight to discuss the location of the State building.  The plans will be submitted to the supervising architects this afternoon for approval and the selection of a site will remove all obstructions to the immediate commencement of construction.</p>
                            <p>Governor Holcomb was in the city this morning and was in consultation with the members of the commission at state headquarters regarding the work of the commission.  He stated that he would not be in attendance at any of the meetings of the commission during this season as he would return to Lincoln this evening.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Mexican Government Promises and Exhibit.</head>
                            <p>The Republic of Mexico will be represented at the Transmississippi Exposition with a suitable exhibit of the resources of that country.  Furthermore, the exposition is to be properly advertised through the official organ of that country, so that all who desire to place individual exhibits may be put in possession of all the facts regarding the big show.</p>
                            <p>Assurances to this effect were received yesterday afternoon by President Wattles of the exposition through Secretary of State Sherman.  The information was conveyed in a communication from A. A. Adee, second assistant secretary of state which gave the cheering news that Mexico had accepted the invitation to take part in the exposition.  Enclosed in this communication was the following report regarding the negotiations in the matter from United States minister to Mexico, Powell Clayton, to Secretary of State Sherman:</p>
                            <p>MEXICO, Aug. 11.&#8212;To the Hon. John Sherman, Secretary of State, Washington D. C.&#8212;Sir: Referring to your unnumbered instructions dated June 15 and July 22, ultimo, respectively, I have the honor to enclose herewith copy and translation of a note from the foreign office transmitting a communication from the minister of fomento, containing the reply of the Mexican government to the invitation of the Transmississippi Exposition, and to my note of June 24 ultimo.</p>
                            <p>The president, after considering the documents, thanks the government of the United States and the president of the exposition, and indicates that the Mexican government wishes to accept the invitation; and will publish the regulations and papers when received in the Diario Oficial that they may come to the knowledge of all persons who may wish to make exhibits; and that the government will send an exhibit to the exposition.  I have the honor, etc.,</p>
                            <l>POWELL CLAYTON.</l>
                            <p>The following translation of the note from the minister of fomento to Minister Clayton, mentioned in the above, was enclosed:</p>
                            <p>MEXICO, Aug. 7.&#8212;His Excellency, Powell Clayton&#8212;Mr. Minister: Referring to your excellency's note of June 24 ultimo, I have the honor to forward herewith copy of a communication from the secretary of fomento, dated the 2d instant, relating to the exposition that will be held in Omaha, Neb., in the year 1898.  I renew to your excellency the assurances of my distinguished consideration.</p>
                            <l>IGNO MARISCAL.</l>
                            <p>Following is a translation of the official document in which the invitation is accepted by the Mexican government:</p>
                            <p>MEXICO, Aug. 2.&#8212;To the Secretary of Foreign Affairs: This department has received your note of the 1st ultimo inclosing another from the minister of the United States, expressing the desire of the Transmississippi and International Exposition and the American government that Mexico take part in an exposition to be held in Omaha, Neb., in the year 1898.  With this note I was pleased to receive a letter from the president of this exposition to the president of Mexico in which the invitation is conveyed.</p>
                            <p>In reply I have the honor to say that after considering the documents the president desires to thank the government of the United States and the president of the exposition, and states that the Mexican government wishes to accept the invitation that has been received, and will, therefore, when the regulations and papers are received, give them publicity in the Diario Oficial that they may be brought to the knowledge of all persons who may wish to make exhibits; and that the government will also take part in the exposition and send an exhibit.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to transmit the resolution of the president, and I renew the assurances of my consideration.</p>
                            <l>FERNANDEZ.</l>
                            <p>President Wattles also received from Second Assistant Secretary of State Adee another communication, in which he says that he encloses for his information "a letter from the Venezuelan foreign office replying to your letter inviting the government of Venezuela to take part in the Transmississippi and International Exposition."</p>
                            <p>President Wattles has not yet succeeded in figuring out the exact nature of this "information."  The enclosure consists of a communication from Ezequiel Ryaz of the Department of Foreign Affairs of Venezuela to Secretary Sherman, but it is written in Spanish and it has not yet been translated.</p>

                            following letter to the heads of executive departments, Smithsonian Institute and members of the Fish Commission from Nashville, a copy of which has been forwarded to Senator Thurston:</p>
                            <p>Sir: I am directed by the board of management of the United States government exhibit at the Tennessee Centennial exposition to invite attention to the fact that much of the material now on exhibition in this city will necessarily be shown at the Transmississippi and International Exposition, to be held in Omaha next June, and should therefore be selected and packed with that object in view, and as some of the members of this board have already been designated as members of the Transmississippi and International Exposition board, it would seem desirable to have the members of the latter board meet the members of the Tennessee Centennial board at its next meeting for conference on matters of mutual interest.  I have, therefore, the honor to extend through you an invitation to the representative of your department on the government board for the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be present at the meeting of the Tennessee Centennial board, to be held at the Department of Agriculture, Washington, September 6 next, at 10 o'clock a. m.  Yours very respectfully,</p>
                            <l>W. V. COX, Secretary.</l>
                            <p>Representatives from the State, Postoffice, Interior, Justice and Navy departments and the Smithsonian institute are yet to be appointed, but it is thought this will be looked after before the date of the called meeting outlined in Secretary Cox's letter.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Subject Upon Which Architects and Contractors Cannot Agree.</head>
                            <p>It is probable that the plan of the supervising architects to color the staff for the building by mixing the coloring with the staff while it is being prepared will not be carried out.  The staff contractors take the position that this method is not practical and cannot be done in an artistic manner with good results.  The staff is mixed with water, and the plan of the architects, which they insist is entirely practical, is to mix the coloring matter with the water.  The staff workers say that it will be impossible to secure the same shade in all the work for the reason that the staff must be mixed in such small quantities owing to the fact that it "sets" so rapidly that different shades will be produced and the buildings will have a mottled appearance.</p>
                            <p>The architects are reluctant to yield on this question, but experiments are now being made with a cheap water color paint which may be desired to give the buildings the desired tint.  The lasting qualities of this material are being tested and experiments are also being made at the Union Pacific shops with a compressed air apparatus for spraying the paint on the buildings.  It is believed that the buildings may be painted in this way at a very small cost.  This method of painting is very expeditious, and the architects say that all of the buildings may be painted in less than thirty days.  If this proves practical and desirable the buildings may be painted next spring and have a fresh and clean appearance all through the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The color with which experiments are being made is a warm, neutral tint which will harmonize excellently with the proposed brilliant colors which it is proposed to use for decoration.</p>

Prof. Owens is commissioner for the electrical section of the exposition, and his recent trip was for the purpose of securing the 1898 conventions of the two leading electrical organizations to be held in Omaha next year and the secure exhibits by the principal electrical instrument manufacturing concerns in the country.  In both of these he was signally successful.  He secured the meetings of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the National Electric Light association, the most important associations of electricians in this country.

He said the report he had to present had been made up by the executive board after serious consideration and was considered a very conservative estimate.  He dwelt especially on the amount of labor involved in gathering desirable and perfect specimens of fruit of all kinds.  He said that less than 5 per cent of ordinary commercial fruit is suitable for exhibition purposes, and this makes it necessary to handle the fruit a number of times in order to sort out all spotted or damaged fruit.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Stevens said that after considering all these points the horticulturists had concluded that their previous estimates would have to be increased rather than lowered.  As an illustration of the value of care in selecting fruit, Mr. Stevens produced a basket of grapes containing about a dozen bunches of different varieties, each bunch being wrapped by itself in tissue paper.  These bunches were each perfect and presented a very tempting appearance.  He also produced from another basket a few apples, each wrapped in paper.  While these appeared to be perfect specimens of fruit, Mr. Stevens pointed out blemishes, which he said would count against the fruit in a contest for premiums.</p>
                            <p>With these object lessons before the commission, Mr. Stevens proceeded to read the following detailed estimate of the expenses necessary for a horticultural exhibit:</p>

                            <p>Mr. Stevens explained the prices quoted by saying that the quality of fruit necessary for exhibition purposes is worth three or four times as much as ordinary fruit.  He explained the apparently large quantity by saying that it would be necessary to change the fruit frequently in order to keep it fresh and this would require a superintendent and assistant and two laborers.  The salary of these men was not included in the estimate given.</p>
                            <p>The matter was informally discussed, but no action was taken, as all these estimates will be taken up at once in executive session when all are received.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Stevens impressed upon the board the importance of getting the work of collecting apples started at once before the apples are fully matured as they keep better in that condition in cold storage.  He said that 600 varieties of apples ought to be obtained and that it would be necessary to visit about 500 orchards to secure them.</p>

                            <p>L. C. Chapin of Lincoln, a member of the Nebraska Floriculture society, appeared before the commission to present the request of the society in making a floral exhibit.  He said that the florists estimated that 2,000 feet of space would be required to make a creditable exhibit.  The cost of this display, including the cost of the space and the expense of transporting the plants and flowers to the exposition, and the salary of a superintendent and such assistants as would be required, would not exceed, in the judgment of the florists, $2,500 or $3,000.  Mr. Chapin explained that the florists would not make any charge for the plants, but would simply want to be paid for the expense of packing them and transporting them to the grounds.</p>
                            <p>This matter was laid over to be taken up later.</p>
                            <p>The commission adjourned at this point for supper, and when it convened in the evening Superintendent Johnson of the agricultural department reported what he had been doing since his appointment.  He said he had secured some specimens of oats, wheat, alfalfa, clover and other small grains, but reported that the farmers are too busy harvesting their immense crops and selling dollar wheat to stop and gather grain for the exposition or anything else but the market.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Foster of the live stock department reported progress in his department, but said he had not been able to do much, because the rules regarding live stock have not been formulated.  He was instructed to confer with Superintendent Dinsmore regarding this matter and report to the commission what is necessary to be done.</p>
                            <p>L. C. Chapin of Lincoln was appointed superintendent of the floral department.</p>
                            <p>It was decided to ask the State Board of Agriculture for a room for headquarters for the commission at the fair grounds, so that an exposition sentiment may be worked up among the patrons of the fair.  All superintendents under the commission were instructed to attend the state fair and make themselves acquainted with exhibitors and endeavor to secure exhibits.</p>
                            <p>The greater part of this morning was spent by the commission in executive session, with President Wattles of the exposition, regarding the state building.  The president suggested that the state building be made larger and so designed that it could be used as an auditorium.  In return for this change in the plan on the part of the commission the president suggested certain concessions which he would recommend to the executive committee of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Before anything definite was decided on in this matter, the commission and the president went out to the grounds to look up the question of a site for the state building.</p>

He secured a large number of valuable suggestions, as well as copies of the rules governing the handling of traffic.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Publicity and Promotion has prepared a large half-tone engraving of the Administration arch, which is printed on heavy enameled paper, 17x24 inches.  These pictures are intended for posting in conspicuous places and will be given to all persons who will agree to display them where they will be seen by the general public.  They may be obtained at the office of the department, room 601 Bee building.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Concessions has entered into a contract for the concession of the Streets of Cairo.  The concessionaire is Leo Bonet, one of the staff contractors.  Superintendent Burns of the Department of Concessions says that Mr. Bonet has associated with him in this concession one of the best oriental showmen in this country and is backed by a large amount of Omaha capital.  The street in this concession will be about 400 feet long and the buildings will be constructed of staff, their estimated cost being from $15,000 to $20,000.</p>
                            <p>The governor of Colorado has notified the Department of Exhibits that he has appointed an exposition commission for Colorado, which will at once take up the work of seeing that the interests of Colorado are properly represented at the exposition.

                            <head type="sub">Modern Renaissance in Style, with Noble Proportions and Artistic Exterior Decorations to Complete its Beauty.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, Aug. 24.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The government building at the Omaha Exposition will be modern renaissance in style, with a magnificent dome overlooking the lagoon, 150 feet high, surmounted by an heroic allegorical figure of Liberty Enlightening the World.  This is the present intention, according to Architect E. A. Crane of the supervising architect's office, who returned today after his vacation.</p>
                            <p>"Instead of three buildings, united by a central court, as originally planned," said Mr. Crane, "the government building will be one large structure 500 feet long and 100 feet wide.  The grounds selected for the exposition are ideal in character, and the position accorded the government building could not be improved upon.  I believe the Omaha Exposition will be easily the greatest exposition since the World's fair, for the people of Omaha are being aroused to the importance of the exposition and everybody seems to talk and think of nothing but next year's fair.  Walker &amp; have done a great work in planning the grounds and the general outlining of the designs of the several structures, which will be rich in coloring and artistic conception.  I hope to have the working drawings of the government building finished in about three weeks or a month.  As soon as possible the department will call for bids, the design being to have the building under roof before January 1, when the staff for the exterior may be made in the building itself.</p>
                            <p>"As for Omaha, it's a busy metropolis, full of handsome structures, and its people impressed me most favorably.  I like the city and its people and believe the government building will be a credit to the exposition."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Plan of Converting the State Structure Into an Auditorium for Exposition Purposes Has Now Been Abandoned.</head>
                            <p>The Nebraska exposition building will stand on the bluff tract of the exposition grounds, facing west, a short distance south of the point where the east end of the grand viaduct across Sherman avenue from the main court rests upon the bluff tract.  The Nebraska building will be the first structure to catch the eye of the visitor, who turns to the beautiful park at the south end of the bluff tract for a rest.  It will be surrounded by beautiful beds of blooming flowers and winding paths, bordered with handsome shrubbery.  An unobstructed view of the broad valley of the Missouri and the beautiful bluffs along the Iowa shore can be had from the balcony on the second story, as there will be nothing in between this building and the edge of the bluff.</p>
                            <p>This location was decided upon this morning by the committee appointed by the Nebraska Exposition commission and the representatives of the Department of Buildings and Grounds.  Nothing remains to be done to make the location officially certain except the approval of the executive committee of the exposition.  As this is the location which has been virtually decided upon from the beginning, there seems to be but little question about it being approved.</p>
                            <p>All negotiations looking to a change in the State building with a view to using it for an auditorium have been dropped and will receive no further consideration.  Both the executive committee and the state commission have come to the conclusion that the scheme is not practical and the commission has instructed its superintendent to make an estimate of the amount of material required for the building already designed.  It is the intention to order the material purchased at the meeting to be held September 7.</p>
                            <p>The members of the state commission are beginning to have doubts about their ability to construct the state building in the way they have decided to operate and keep the cost within the original estimate of $16,000.  This estimate was intended to cover every expense in connection with the erection of the building and it is the intention to have the work done by day's labor, employing men from all sections of the state on the work.  Under this plan the commission has no means of telling what the cost will be and some of the members are beginning to have serious doubts on this point.</p>

                            <p>The bid of G. H. King of Omaha was irregular, not being on the blank furnished for bidders and not complying with the instructions to bidders in other particulars.  The bids included interior plastering, but did not include the staff work, and it was announced that it would be impossible to separate these two.  It is probable that this bid will be rejected on account of irregularity.  The lowest bidder on the carpentry was Hamilton Brothers of Omaha, $32,791.  On the staff work Smith &amp; Eastman were the lowest, $10,757, making the total cost of the building under these bids, $43,548.  These are the bids in detail:</p>

                            <head type="sub">National Association of Letter Carriers May Come Next Year.</head>
                            <p>The chances for securing another important convention for Omaha next year have been greatly improved within the last few days.</p>
                            <p>Omaha letter carriers are jubilant over the turn affairs have taken recently and think that the 1898 meeting of the National Association of Letter Carriers will be held in this city.  At the last meeting San Francisco was fixed upon as the place of meeting for this year, the date being September 6.  It was agreed that the San Francisco people should do certain things if the convention was located there.  They failed to keep their promises and the executive committee, which was vested with that power, has recently announced that the meeting this year will be held in Chicago on the date named. The Omaha carriers say this will greatly increase their chances for securing the next convention, as no meeting of the association was ever held in the west.  They will send a well organized delegation to Chicago with instructions to secure the next meeting.</p>

County Superintendent of Schools Bodwell and Mrs. Jennie Keyser <choice><sic>ofth ectiy</sic><corr>of the city</corr></choice> schools tried to interest the teachers in the educational department of the big show.

                            <p>Today's work consisted in still more advanced instruction in music language, reading, didactics, history, primary reading and bookkeeping.  The regular corps of instructors conducted the classes.  The lecture this afternoon at 3 o'clock was delivered by W. H. Skinner of Nebraska City, who spoke upon "Oliver Wendell Holmes."</p>

                            <p>Walter W. Pollock, commercial agent for the exposition in Wisconsin, writes to the Department of Exhibits from Milwaukee that the merchants of Wisconsin have formed a private company to erect a building on the exposition grounds, working in conjunction with several of the famous mineral spring companies of the state, and architects are at work for plans for the building.  Mr. Pollock says the building will be beautified in the interior by fountains supplied with the various mineral waters and that statues by Wisconsin artists will be grouped in the building.  Another feature will be an interesting historical exhibit, which is now being collected.  Mr. Pollock gives every assurance that Wisconsin will be represented in a way which will reflect great credit upon the state.</p>

Our artists are all Italians, belonging to the celebrated Pellarin and Rosa families of mosaic artists, known throughout the world.</p>

We are in hearty sympathy with every effort to make it a success, as in the friendly rivalry of states our prosperity and greatness may be fully shown, and we favor the judicious expenditure of such an amount as may be necessary to make a creditable exhibit of Iowa products and industries."</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The plan for a water system for the exposition grounds was approved by the executive committee of the Transmississippi Exposition at its regular meeting yesterday afternoon.  These plans had previously been examined and approved by the city engineer and the chief of the fire department.  They provide for lines of mains extending the entire length of the main court on the north and south sides at the rear of the main buildings, with branches extending entirely around each of the main buildings; also a large main extending the full length of the Plaisance on the bluff tract with numerous branches, and a main for the old fair grounds tract with a connecting main running through the "neck" between the main court and the north tract.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Buildings and Ground was authorized to close a contract with Dennis Long &amp; Co. of Louisville, Ky., for the pipe and fittings necessary to lay this system for $8,668.  The plan also contemplated the placing of a number of fire hydrants and the department was authorized to enter into a contract for these at a price not exceeding $2,625.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles, who is in charge of the Department of Buildings and Grounds in the absence of Manager Kirkendall, asked for authority to advertise for bids for digging the ditches and laying the water pipes.  He was informed that the department already had authority to ask for bids for the work and he gave notice that he would ask for bids for this work, to be opened at 5 p. m. September 1.</p>

                            <p>The bids for the construction of the sewer on the bluff and the north tracts, which were opened a few days ago, were laid before the committee for action.  The lowest bidder was found to by John F. Daley, whose bid was $809.37.  Objection was raised by members of the executive committee against awarding the contract to Daley for the reason that he is in the employ of the Department of Buildings and Grounds as an inspector at $5 per day, and it was urged that employes of the exposition must not be allowed to compete for contracts without first severing their connection with the exposition.  This view met with the unanimous approval of the committee and it was decided to award the contract for the sewer to the next lowest bidder, H. C. Sharp, whose bid was only $1.36 higher than Daley's, being $810.83.  A contract for this work was ordered drawn with Sharp.</p>
                            <p>The bids for the construction of the Machinery and Electricity building were next laid before the committee for action.  The attention of the committee was called to the fact, which was published at the time the bids were opened, that the bid of G. H. King of Council Bluffs, $32,456, was irregular in that it was not made in accordance with the plain instructions to bidders.  The bid stated that the price named included the interior plaster work, but did not include the piling.  The instructions to bidders required that they must include the plastering with the staff work, and that the piling must be included in the carpenter work with the deduction which would be made by the contractor in case the exposition decided to do the piling.  The form of King's bid made it impossible for any comparison to be made with any of the other bids, and it was decided by the committee that the bid must be rejected and this was done.</p>
                            <p>The next lowest bid on the carpentry was that of Hamilton Bros. of Omaha, $32,791.  This included the piling, for which the bid allowed a reduction of $1,500 in case the exposition did the piling.  Acting Manager Wattles announced that an agreement had been made with Hamilton Bros. by which they had agreed to do the piling and make a reduction in their original bid of $300, thus making the carpenter work cost <hi rend="underline">$32,491</hi>.  The contract for the staff work was ordered let to Smith &amp; Eastman, the lowest bidders, at their bid of $10,757, making the total cost of the building, $43,248.</p>
                            <p>The bond of Goldie &amp; Sons of Chicago, carpenter contractors for the Mines building, was presented, with John M. Smyth, a Chicago millionaire, as surety.  The bond was approved.</p>

                            <p>A faint echo of the railway question was heard in the shape of letters from General Manager Dickinson of the Union Pacific and Assistant General Freight Agent Merchant of the Elkhorn road.  Mr. Dickinson said he had been unable to be down to attend any meetings of the committee, but had looked over the Missouri Pacific contract and thought the charge per car was somewhat higher than is ordinarily charged in this section, but did not regard it as excessive in consideration of the outlay required.  Mr. Merchant explained that General Manager Bidwell is out of the city and suggested that if the exposition would secure a crossing over the Missouri Pacific tracks the Elkhorn might enter the grounds on terms that would be favorable to the exposition.  No action was taken on the matter.</p>
                            <p>The committee has not yet been able to get a meeting with the railway managers, as there had been no time since the committee was instructed to confer with them that all three of the managers have been in the city at the same time.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion announced that the plan for holding an interstate reunion of the members of the Grand Army of the Republic during the exposition had made favorable progress at the national encampment at Buffalo.  He stated that the movement had received the sanction of Commander-in-Chief Clarkson and that a proclamation had been issued by the Department of Nebraska at the encampment inviting the members of the organization in Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, the two Dakotas and Minnesota, to come to Nebraska in September, 1898, and hold a grand interstate encampment.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EVERYTHING TO BE READY OPENING DAY</head>
                            <head type="sub">All the Main Buildings Will Be Under Course of Erection Before the Close of September.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The work on the exposition grounds is progressing favorably.  The grading on the main court is now completed and it is no longer difficult for a visitor to form in his mind's eye a picture of how the main court will look when the buildings are erected and all of the embellishments are in place.  The site which each building is to occupy is now marked by a depression of from two to four feet.  All around these depressions the ground is levelled off and covered with black dirt in readiness for the gardener when the buildings shall have been completed.  In the depressions the piles for the foundations will be driven and the buildings erected on these, the floors of the buildings rising slightly above the level of the ground surrounding them.  All is now ready for the building contractors and within the next thirty days the main court will be a veritable bee hive.</p>
                            <p>Contracts for the erection of the Administration building, the Manufactures building, the Mines and Mining building, and the Machinery and Electricity building have been let, and the Agriculture building will be put on the boards for bids this week.  The working drawings for the Art building will be ready for the contractors within a few days, and the revised place for the Auditorium are under contract to be completed by September 10.  Plans for the new building for the main court, the Liberal Arts building, will be completed within a short time.</p>
                            <p>The Administration building is in the hands of Briggs &amp; Cushman, carpenters, and Leo Bonet, staff contractor.  The frame work of the building is almost completed and the work of putting on the staff was commenced Saturday morning.  This building will be completed within thirty days.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SECOND BUILDING UNDER WAY.</head>
                            <p>The Manufactures building is let to R. C. Strehlow of Omaha, carpenter, and Smith &amp; Eastman of Chicago, staff workers.  The pile foundation is all in place, and the sill and portions of the superstructure have been completed in some parts of the building.  The material is nearly all on the ground and the work is progressing rapidly.  The staff contractors have their workshop completed and have commenced work on molding the staff ornamental work.</p>
                            <p>Goldie &amp; Sons of Chicago have the carpenter contract for the Mines building and they say they will commence work putting in the foundation this week.  The staff contract for this building was let to Smith &amp; Eastman.</p>
                            <p>The contract for the Machinery and Electricity building was let Friday of last week to Hamilton Bros., carpenters, Omaha, and Smith &amp; Eastman, staff contractors.</p>
                            <p>The supervising architect of the Treasury department of the federal government is at work on the plane for the government building, and it is announced from that office that the building will be under cover by January 1, and that the staff work will be carried on inside the building.</p>
                            <p>When it is borne in mind that the erection of staff buildings is almost like the growth of a magic city in the night by the lamp of Alladin, it will be seen that the progress made up to this time is really wonderful.  If the necessity arose for extreme haste any building on the ground could be completed within sixty days, so that the apparent slowness is only the result of involuntary comparison with ordinary building operations.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">BUILDINGS TO BE PAINTED.</head>
                            <p>Although no official announcement has been made, it has been practically decided that the "old ivory" effect on the buildings will not be accomplished by mixing the coloring material with the staff as it is being prepared, but will be obtained by painting the buildings after the staff is all in place.  This decision seems to be the result of a strong disinclination on the part of the staff contractors to try what they say is simply an experiment.  Notwithstanding the fact that the art building in the Nashville exposition is a forcible proof that the staff may be successfully colored, the contractors refuse to concede that it may be done, and the attempt to convince them has been abandoned.</p>
                            <p>Experiments are now being made with a cheap paint by which the same effect may be produced.  This paint will be sprayed on the immense surfaces of the main buildings with air brushes, similar to those used at the World's fair.  For this purpose compressed air machinery is used and the paint is sprayed in a fine stream through a nozzle which is handled by a workman in much the same manner as hose is used to sprinkle a lawn.  Experiments have recently been made at the Union Pacific shops, which has the largest compressed air plant in this part of the country.  It has been demonstrated that this paint may be put on by these machines at a price which is ridiculously low.  One of the machines with which these experiments have been made has seven nozzles and the surface which may be covered in a day by a single machine is astonishing.  The paint with which experiments have been made is a rich, warm cream color and appears to be permanent in its color.  It is being subjected to severe tests and will be adopted if it passes through the ordeal successfully.  With this as a background the rich hues contemplated in the elaborate color scheme of the main court will stand out in strong contrast and impart a rich flavor to the scene which will rival the beauties of old Pompeii.</p>

                            <p>The grading of the bluff tract is about completed and the work of erecting the buildings which are to stand on this portion of the grounds will soon be commenced.  A line drawn across this tract east and west from the east end of the viaduct leading into the bluff tract from the main court will divide the tract into two distinct sections.  North of this line will be the Plaisance with its foreign villages, its engineering novelties, and its various sources of amusement and instruction.  South of this line will be the horticultural section of the great show, taking the form, in part, of a beautiful park where the public may seek rest and repose and enjoy at the same time, a view of the beautiful valley of the Missouri and the frowning bluffs skirting the river on the Iowa side.</p>
                            <p>The Horticulture building will form a prominent feature of this section of the grounds.  It will stand about in the center of the south half of the bluff tract, opposite <hi rend="underline">Lothrop street</hi>.  It will be a handsome and imposing building and will be filled with rare and beautiful creations of nature.  Surrounding this building will be a beautiful park, filled with flower beds and winding walks and with plenty of shady nooks where the visitor may seek rest while enjoying the beauties of nature.</p>
                            <p>Here and there about this park will be the various state buildings, each of which will be used only as a meeting place for visitors from all over the land.  The Nebraska building will be prominent among these and will probably be the headquarters for many of the states.  The Nebraska Exposition commission has offered accommodations in their building to any state which desires to take advantage of it, and the building is designed to afford plenty of office rooms besides the ample parlors and reading rooms, toilet rooms, and the numerous other things necessary for the accommodation of the visiting public, but which could find no place in an exhibit building.</p>

                            <p>The indications at this time are that several other states will erect buildings of their own on this tract.  Illinois will have a building; Wisconsin has taken steps to erect a handsome building which will be decorated by the numerous mineral spring companies of that state; Iowa will have a state building for a meeting place for Iowans; negotiations are being made by one or two other states for space and other preliminaries for the erection of state buildings, and it appears probable that the state buildings will form a prominent feature of the bluff park.</p>
                            <p>The experiment of mixing black earth with the clay of the bottom of the lagoon and rolling the mixture with a heavy steam roller seems to be a success so far as holding water is concerned.  The entire bottom has been rolled and is as level and hard as a floor.  Water from the rain early in

                            the week is still standing in places in the lagoon.</p>
                            <p>The work on the sheet piling which is to line the banks of the canal is progressing slowly.  The stay piles and back piles are all in place and the work of bracing the stay piles by fastening them to the back piles is going along.  The stringers to which the sheet piling is to be fastened are being put in place and the sheet piling is on the ground ready for use.</p>
                            <p>Since the banks of the canal have been "squared up" it has been rather inconvenient to get from the north to the south side of the lagoon without going entirely around the big hole, a distance of at least half a mile.  A temporary bridge will probably be put across at the point where the permanent iron bridge will be constructed, where the canal intersects Twentieth street.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Florists Preparing to Come to the Exposition for the Purpose of Making a Great Exhibit.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Prof. F. W. Taylor, chief of the Bureau of Forestry, Irrigation and Horticulture of the Transmississippi Exposition, has returned from a trip through the east in the interest of the exposition.  The main object of Prof. Taylor's trip was to attend the meeting of the American Florists' association, which met in Providence, R. I., early in the month.  The fact that he secured the next meeting to be held in Omaha in 1898 has already been announced.</p>
                            <p>At this meeting Prof. Taylor met all of the prominent florists of the country and interested them in the exposition and secured agreements that they would attend and make exhibits of the flowers.  F. R. Pierson of Tarrytown and J. C. Vaughan, the well known Chicago florist, were especially enthusiastic over the idea of making striking exhibits.  Both of these men are intensely interested in the development of the canna, the bedding plant of large leaf and brilliant bloom, which has sprung into great popularity in recent years.  Mr. Pierson is the proud possessor of a new canna, which is said to possess the attribute so eagerly sought in canna growers&#8212;a brilliant yellow flower of perfect form.  Both Pierson and Vaughan were anxious to secure space on the bluff tract outside of the Horticulture building, where they can make exhibits of all varieties of cannas.</p>

                            <p>In addition to these, Prof. Taylor found a large number of other growers who made application for space with a view of installing exhibits of rare and beautiful flowers.  These applications show that water plants of all kinds, the beautiful water lilies of all species and many other varieties of these rare and wonderful plants will be exhibited in profusion.  Bulbous plants of all species, together with rare plants grown for their foliage, will decorate the interior and exterior of the Horticulture building with all the hues of the rainbow.</p>
                            <p>In addition to securing the next meeting of the florists, Prof. Taylor called upon four members of the executive committee of the American Seed Trade association and invited them to hold the next meeting of the association in Omaha.  The association holds its meetings early in June, the meeting this year having been held at Washington, D. C.  The executive committee of seven members is empowered to fix the place of meeting and Prof. Taylor says he feels safe in saying that the next meeting will be held in Omaha.</p>
                            <p>While talking about his experience in the east Prof. Taylor remarked especially about the different feeling that eastern people seem to have toward the west, and Nebraska especially about the different feeling that eastern people seem to have toward the west, and Nebraska especially, as compared with the sentiments freely expressed throughout the east on that subject a year ago.  He said he had constantly been met with inquiries about the change which had taken place in conditions in Nebraska and especially as to the effect the rise in the price of wheat would have on the state.  He found a great interest in all parts of the east in the general conditions in this state and also in the values of land and kindred matters.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Views Expressed by Architect Perkins of Chicago.</head>
                            <p>Dwight H. Perkins of Chicago, architect of the Machinery and Electricity building, is in the city in consultation with the supervising architects of the exposition regarding the working out of the detail decoration of the building.</p>
                            <p>"There is one thing about your exposition," said Mr. Perkins this morning, "that your people are to be congratulated upon, and that is the tremendous progress that has been made in the mechanical part of the work.  Matters have reached a point where your exposition could easily be opened February 1 of next year, so far as the buildings are concerned.  People who are not familiar with this class of work do not appreciate the great effect the duplication of units in these large buildings has upon the time required for their construction.  If it became necessary, every building on the grounds could be completed within ninety days.</p>
                            <p>"What strikes me most forcibly in connection with your exposition," continued Mr. Perkins, "is the lack of hotel accommodations.  Your people do not seem to appreciate the fact that Omaha is going to be overcrowded with a perfect horde of visitors who will require accommodations which your city is not prepared to give.</p>
                            <p>"To get back to the exposition, I can truthfully say that Omaha is going to have an exposition which will compare favorably with any exposition ever held in the world and which will eclipse anything ever held on this side of the water, except the World's fair, and it will compare very favorably with that from an architectural standpoint.  I am delighted with the prospect and feel as much interest in it as though I was a citizen of Omaha.  I have been in consultation with Mr. Kimball regarding the detailed ornamentation on the Machinery building and shall take occasion to return to Omaha at frequent intervals during the construction of that building."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Missouri Pacific's Switching Contract Under Discussion.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition held a special meeting at noon today for the purpose of taking up the railway question and arriving at some conclusion respecting the matter.  The three directors who are general managers of Omaha roads were invited to attend the meeting, according to the instruction of the Board of Directors to the committee, but Mr. Bidwell of the Elkhorn was the only one who responded.</p>
                            <p>The question was discussed at length and in detail, Commissioner Utt of the Commercial club being called in to take part in the deliberations.  The principal feature of the discussion was the charge of $4 per car which was contemplated in the Missouri Pacific contract.  Mr. Utt suggested a sliding scale by which the amount of charge would be made to all shippers, the exposition to receive a rebate under the operation of the sliding scale.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bidwell was very guarded in his expressions regarding the terms proposed by the Missouri Pacific contract, but said the charges "were high enough."  He reviewed the circumstances of the Elkhorn's connection with the exposition-railway question and stated, in effect, that the Missouri Pacific had broken faith with the Elkhorn by violating the promise made when the change of site was suggested to the effect that the Missouri Pacific would consent to any reasonable arrangement for allowing the Elkhorn to cross its tracks under any arrangement.  In this connection, Mr. Bidwell took occasion to emphatically deny the statements circulated by a local representative of the Missouri Pacific to the effect that he (Bidwell) had voted against the change of site.  He said he had voted for the change as being in the best interest of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>In reply to a direct question from one of the committee, Mr. Bidwell said he did not think it advisable for his road to undertake to enter the grounds with a view to doing the switching for the exposition, as the attitude of the Missouri Pacific would cause a delay of form sixty to ninety days.</p>
                            <p>The discussion continued for some time, but no action was taken by the committee.</p>

                            <p>Hon. George W. Lininger has returned from a trip to his old home in Pennsylvania, where he spent a couple of weeks in renewing the acquaintances of his youth, before he left for the then untraveled west, with the substantial progress of which he has since been intimately identified.</p>
                            <p>On his return trip, Mr. Lininger stopped at Nashville, where he visited the Tennessee Centennial exposition.  He speaks in terms of the highest praise of the artistic merit of the exposition, and says that it promises to be a financial success.  Up to a week ago the total attendance reached about 900,000, sand interest seems to continue unabated.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the art exhibit and the collection of historical articles, Mr. Lininger said the collection of each was well worth a visit to see.  He said the exposition was much more extensive than he expected to see, and he was more than favorably impressed with the manner in which strangers in the city were treated.  He said there was no disposition to overcharge visitors for accommodations, meals and accommodations being maintained at ordinary rates.  In addition to this, he stated that the residents of Nashville seemed to take a personal interest in seeing that strangers were courteously treated.</p>

The planks are of pine, three inches thick, twelve inches wide and are tongued and grooved in the edges.  The joints are covered with white lead before the planks are put in place and they are then driven closely together, forming a watertight joint.  The lower end of the piling is set in a trench and driven into the ground about six inches.  The trench is then filled up, the earth being tamped tightly.  It has not been found necessary to use cement at the bottom of the piling, as it was first thought might be required.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Work Will Be Completed Within the Next Ten Days.</head>
                            <p>The work of laying the sewer on the exposition grounds is progressing rapidly and the whole work will probably be completed within the next ten days.  There is about 2,000 feet in all to be laid, and Contractor Daley now has about 300 feet completed.  The pipe used in this sewer is 12 and 15-inch sewer pipe laid below the frost line.  It is the intention to allow the sewer to remain after the exposition is closed and for this purpose the pipe is being laid as a permanent sewer.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Another Exposition Structure to Be Erected Upon the Bluffs Tract&#8212;Drawings of Liberal Arts Building About Complete.</head>
                            <p>The design for the Horticulture building has been completed and the working drawings are in hand.  It is expected that the drawings will be ready for inviting bids within a very short time.  This building differs somewhat from the other main buildings in that it has a broken sky line.  It has a strong central mass with flanking wings.  The center is surmounted by a large dome, flanked by pavilions surmounted by subsidiary domes.  There is a profusion of ornamentation on the free classic order and a most pleasing effect is seen in the entire design.  Charles F. Beindorff is the architect of this building, which is located on the bluff tract amid the flower beds with which this portion of the grounds will be decorated.  It will contain the exhibits of horticulture, forestry and kindred industries.</p>
                            <p>The Liberal Arts building, the new building on the main court which is to be erected as an adjunct to the Manufactures building, is well under way and Fisher &amp; Lawrie, the architects, announce that the drawings will be completed within a week.  This building is to be 240x130 feet and will occupy the site originally designed for the Fine Arts building.  It will pair with the Fine Arts building, which will stand next west of it, and will be a simple, but dignified structure of classic design.  The building will be forty-five feet in height, with a high stylobate surmounted by an order with columns in pairs.  There will be no central motive, as in the other main buildings, but the building will be characterized by strong corner pavilions, accentuated by pediments bearing appropriate motives.  There will be entrances at the corners, in the center and at the ends of the building.</p>

                            <p>Louisiana is the first state in the union to make a formal application for space for a state exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition.  The application was received this morning from Colonel G. J. Lee, commissioner for the Louisiana Bureau of Agriculture.</p>
                            <p>Accompanying the application was a letter from Colonel Lee in which he stated that a representative of the state would visit Omaha the latter part of this month for the purpose of arranging the details for the exhibit to be made by the state.  The writer further stated that it would be the  aim of the state officials to make the best possible showing of the resources of Louisiana, and they were especially desirous of doing so in view of the display made by Nebraska at the New Orleans exposition in 1887.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The regular meeting of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi association was held last evening.  The chief matter taken up for discussion was the proposition of the Lake Manawa Railway company to extend its lines via the East Omaha bridge directly into the exposition grounds in Omaha.  The subject was introduced by the submission of the following resolution:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The interests of Council Bluffs in the exposition and the benefits that our city will derive therefrom very largely depend upon the success of your committee in obtaining good and rapid transportation facilities, and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, There is a proposition pending between the Lake Manawa Railway company and the East Omaha Street Railway company and the East Omaha Street Railway company, whereby the Lake Manawa Railway company proposes to construct and equip an electric line from Council Bluffs to the bridge of the Omaha Bridge &amp; Terminal company, and thus connect with the East Omaha Street Railway company direct to the grounds of the exposition, and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The route proposed is the shortest and most direct route from Council Bluffs to the exposition and would be exclusively a Council Bluffs rapid transit line and would consequently be of great benefit to the business interests of Council Bluffs, and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, We believe from an investigation that, by the granting of a franchise to the Lake Manawa Railway company for the proposed route, said company will be able to carry out the proposition and that the proposed line will be constructed; therefore, be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That it is the sense of this committee that the franchise asked by the Lake Manawa Railway company should be granted for the best interests of the city and to better enable our city to derive her just share of advantage from the coming exposition.</p>
                            <l>J. P. GREENSHIELDS.</l>
                            <l>M. F. ROHRER.</l>
                            <l>J. M. BARSTOW.</l>
                            <l>SAMUEL HAAS.</l>
                            <l>J. H. CLEAVER.</l>
                            <p>The matter required but little explanation, for all of the members of the association were familiar with the plans of the Manawa company and knew the project of building a new line across the river has been under contemplation ever since the exposition movement was gotten well under way. Mr. Greenshields, who presented the resolution, explained it for the benefit of any members who did not fully understand it.  There was no opposition whatever to giving the company all of the assistance the association could and the resolution was approved.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WANTS A NEW CHARTER.</head>
                            <p>Later in the evening Mr. Tinley, the attorney for the company, was seen and explained the proposition the company would soon submit to the council.  He said the request to have the present charter extended was a part of the plan, and at the next meeting of the council an amended charter would be presented, empowering the company to construct the new line.  This will run from the present terminus of the road at Ninth street and Broadway, Council Bluffs, over the most feasible route to the new bridge.  The construction of less than half a mile of track on the Nebraska side of the river would enable on the other side of the river would enable the company to form a junction with the East Omaha line, whose track would be used from there to the south entrance of the exposition grounds.  Altogether, the company would not be obliged to construct more than two and one-half miles of line.  This, with the equipment of the present Manawa line with electric cars, would necessitate an expenditure of only $75,000.  Every dollar of this money was in sight, Mr. Tinley declared, and it is all Council Bluffs capital.  The new line will be able to land passengers at the exposition gates in twenty-five minutes.  It will also go through the heart of the manufacturing district of East Omaha and give a new boom to that section.  Mr. Tinley declared that work on the line will be commenced at the earliest possible moment after securing the franchise from the council.</p>
                            <p>The members of the exposition association are very much taken with the idea, and will give the plan all of the assistance possible.</p>
                            <p>The financial affairs of the association received a good deal of attention.  It had been discovered that the resolution taxing each of the members $10 to start with was not very popular, and a motion rescinding it was made and carried.  The treasurer reported that a number of the members had paid their assessments and asked what disposition should be made of the money.  All of the members present who had paid announced their willingness to let the money remain in the treasury as a donation.</p>
                            <p>A resolution was passed requesting the members of the Fruit Growers' association to make an appropriation to assist in the financial work of the association.  The finance committee was instructed to go ahead and raise as much money as possible in the usual way of soliciting funds for public purposes.</p>

                            <head type="sub">VETERANS MEET IN OMAHA NEXT YEAR</head>
                            <head type="sub">Plan for the Gathering of the Boys in Blue is Indorsed by Officers of the Grand Army of the Republic.</head>
                            <p>Colonel John H. Pierce of Omaha, who attended the national encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic at Buffalo in the interest of the Transmississippi Exposition for the purpose of working up the project for an interstate reunion of the members of the Grand Army of the Republic in Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wyoming, Colorado and Nebraska, to be held in Omaha the latter part of next year, during the progress of the exposition, has returned to Omaha greatly elated over his success in accomplishing the result desired.  As was announced in The Bee Friday of last week, the projected reunion received the endorsement of Past Commander-in-Chief Clarkson and Commander-in-Chief Gobin.  The official invitation was issued by the Department of Nebraska, inviting the members of the states named to attend the reunion.</p>
                            <p>The Buffalo Express of last Saturday contained an article on this subject which Colonel Pierce brought back with him and from this the following extracts are made:</p>
                            <p>"The Grand Army of the Republic, members of the states of Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wyoming and Colorado will hold an interstate reunion at Omaha, Neb., next year.  The reunion will be held in conjunction with the encampment of the regular army and the National Guards, which is to be in Omaha in 1898.  Besides the encampment of the regular army and the national guards, the Transmississippi Exposition is to be held at Omaha in 1898, and the reunion will be at that time.</p>
                            <p>"The idea of holding an interstate reunion originated with some of the prominent men of Nebraska.  One of the leaders in the movement is Colonel John H. Pierce of Omaha, who came to Buffalo with other members of the Grand Army of the Republic, and while here worked hard in the interest of the interstate reunion.</p>
                            <p>"The following is the document in pursuance of which tens of thousands of veterans will no doubt assemble in Omaha next year:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, More than 100,000 of the surviving veterans of the union armies have made their homes in the great Mississippi valley; and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, An encampment of the regular army and national guards will be held at Omaha during the month of September, 1898, in which fully 25,000 men are expected to participate; and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The Transmississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha in the year 1898 will present an opportunity for securing low transportation rates; therefore, be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the Department of Nebraska hereby extends a cordial invitation to the members of the Grand Army of the Republic in the stated adjacent, namely, those in the states of Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wyoming and Colorado, to participate with them in an interstate Grand Army of the Republic reunion, to be held at a time agreed upon by department commanders of these states.</p>
                            <p>"First securing the written endorsements of both the retiring and incoming commander-in-chief and the signatures of the department commander of Nebraska and his official companions, Colonel Piece immediately interested the commander of the various states named in the resolutions, and without an exception they not only accepted and endorsed, but promised to work for and attend this western reunion of the veterans."</p>
                            <p>The following is an addenda to the resolutions:</p>
                            <p>"On behalf of the respective departments we, the undersigned, officers of the Grand Army of the Republic, accept the invitation so advantageously extended."  It was signed by A. H. Evans, D. C., of Iowa; D. W. McElroy, A. A. G., of Iowa; John P. Platt, D. C., of Missouri; E. D. Wood, D. C. of Minnesota; Theodore Botkin, D. C., of Kansas; C. B. Clark, D. C. of South Dakota; U. S. Hollister, D. C. of Colorado and Wyoming; Theodore W. Cook, P. D. C. of Colorado and Wyoming; George W. Carpenter, P. D. C. of Kansas; S. L. Wilson, S. V. C. of Kansas; B. L. Carr, P. D. C. of Colorado and Wyoming.</p>
                            <p>The following constituted a second addenda: "Reunions are needed, the more the better, for they are schools of patriotism; hence we will use every endeavor to make a signal success of this great Transmississippi gathering of our comrades."  This was signed by the following named past commanders-in-chief: John P. Rea, John Palmer, Robert B. Beath, J. G. B. Adams, I. N. Walker, A. G. Wissert and Louis W. Yates.</p>

                            <p>Colonel Pierce said that among the Nebraskans who helped to secure this union the following labored zealously: John A. Ehrhardt, D. C.; James G. Gage, A. A. G.; A. C. Cole, P. D. C.; J. H. Culver, P. D. C.; C. Adams, P. D. C.; H. E. Palmer, P. D. C.; and M. L. Hayward, delegate-at-large.  Many others were heartily interested, and among them Colonel Pierce gave the names of General T. S. Clarkson, General John P. S. Gobin, Colonel James Lewis and Corporal James Tanner, but Colonel Pierce said that the man who worked harder than any other and who was most eminently successful, the soldiers and everybody else knows as Captain Jack Crawford, the poet scout.</p>
                            <p>No definite arrangements have yet been made for this reunion, but Colonel Pierce said this matter would be taken up at once and preparations made for making this encampment a memorable one in many respects.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GOVERNMENT'S MINERAL EXHIBIT.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Dr. Day Confers Upon the Subject with Exposition Management.</head>
                            <p>David T. Day, Ph.D., chief of the mining division of the United States Geological survey, was in the city today for the purpose of conferring with the exposition management with reference to the exhibit of the mineral resources of the transmississippi region, which the government is desirous of making.  Dr. Day was in full charge of the mining building at the Atlanta exposition, the local management turning the entire mining exhibit over to the government officials, who took the exhibits furnished by exhibitors from all the mining districts of the state and supplied what was lacking to make a complete and systematic exhibit of the mineral resources of the south.  The result was an exhibit which was declared by a competent judge now in this city, and who was in Atlanta during the entire exposition, to be the best exhibit of mineral resources ever made in this country.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Day stated to a Bee representative that Director Wolcott of the survey had directed him to prepare a plan for showing the entire mineral resources of the transmississippi region and he was here for the purpose of informing himself regarding the facilities which will be provided for making such an exhibit.  He met President Wattles this morning and visited the exposition grounds this afternoon, after which he left the city, returning again to the east.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the mineral exhibit, Dr. Day said: "It would be located in the Government building unless the exposition management furnishes the space in the Mines building.  It would be much better to have the exhibit located in the latter building, as a considerable space would be required to make a creditable exhibit, and the space which could be devoted to that purpose in the Government building would be too small to give good results."</p>
                            <p>"The mineral resources of the transmississippi region are so extensive," continued the doctor, "that a very large space will be required to show them properly and systematically.  The exhibit, if properly made, will cover almost the entire range of minerals known to man.  The government exhibit is arranged in orderly sequence and is calculated to give the visitor an intelligent idea of the subject.  It is easy enough to get exhibits which are of a commercial order, such as exhibits of various products from the exhibition of which the exhibitor expects to derive a direct advantage, the same as he would from an advertisement, but when it is attempted to secure the material for a systematic mineral exhibit, the task is much more difficult.  This is exactly what the geological survey does, and it is what we expect to do at the Transmississippi Exposition.  Whether the government exhibit will be made in the Government building or in the Mines building remains to be seen.  If the exposition management desires to have us put the exhibit in the Mines building, that will be done under certain contingencies, but otherwise it will be placed in the Government building, but in the latter event it will be considerably curtailed on account of lack of space."</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the Woman's Board of Managers convened this morning for the purpose of considering matters pertaining to the affairs of the exposition.  Four of the seven members were present: President Sawyer, Chairman Hartford, Mrs. Giffert of West Point and Miss McHugh of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The committee will remain in session all day, there being several matters which will be laid before it for consideration.  Among these will be the question of congresses, covering the number and character of these gatherings and the manner of conducting them.  The matter of forming an advisory council, as contemplated by the plan of organization of the Board of Managers, will also receive consideration.</p>
                            <p>The question of raising funds for the erection of the Girl's and Boys' building will be another matter which will engage the attention of the committee.  Secretary Ford has a plan of raising $1,000 of the $5,000 required, by soliciting $1 subscriptions from the parents of Omaha.  Each subscription of $1, covering twenty shares of stock, entitled the subscriber to a stock certificate which is suitable for framing.</p>

The organ in question will cost the manufacturer, according to his statement, the sum of $5,000, but the only pay he will receive will be the advertisement derived from having his name on all the programs in which the organ will be used.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Over Twenty Millions Within Five Hundred Miles.</head>
                            <p>OMAHA, Sept. 2.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: A recent issue of the Philadelphia Record contained a very flattering notice of the Transmississippi Exposition.  It predicted a successful show and gave reasons why.  One of them was that within a radius of 500 miles of Omaha 5,000,000 people resided.  This is so glaring an error that I take the liberty of correcting it through The Bee.  I assert that within a radius of 500 miles of Omaha there are more people than there are within 500 miles of Boston.  The Boston circle would include Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia and most of Pennsylvania and Virginia, which states in 1890 had a total population of 20,508,800.  The 500-mile circle around Omaha would include all of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, North and South Dakota and most of Arkansas, Colorado and the Indian Territory, which had a total population in 1890 of 16,057,047, besides a large part of Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Wyoming and Montana, the parts of which lying within the circle contained in 1890 more than 2,000,000 people, this gave the Boston district 2,451,753 more people in 1890 than the Omaha district, but if we calculate the increase of population at the same ratio from 1890 until the present time, as was shown between 1880 and 1890, we should have nearly 1,000,000 more people within the 500 miles of Omaha than within the same distance of Boston.  No city in the country is more accessible than Omaha.  Twelve great trunk lines of railroads center here, running upwards of 100 passenger trains in and out of the city daily.  When the liberality of the western people is considered in comparison with the eastern and southern, there is no doubt that the attendance at the exposition will far exceed the expectations of all but the most enthusiastic.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Government Prepares to Rush Its Exposition Home.</head>
                            <p>The government building for the Transmississippi Exposition is making good progress, according to a letter received this morning by Walker &amp; Kimball, <choice><sic>suprevising</sic><corr>supervising</corr></choice> architects of the exposition, from E. A. Crane of the office of the supervising architect of the Treasury department, who has direct charge of the designing of the government's building and the drawings showing the elevations will be sent to Omaha, so as to reach here early next week.  As has been stated heretofore, <choice><sic>thi sbuilding</sic><corr>this building</corr></choice> will be the largest structure on the exposition grounds.  It will stand at the west end of the main court, facing the lagoon.  The statue of liberty which will surmount the central dome will rest on a pedestal 150 feet above the ground and will be the highest point on the entire exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>It is the intention of the federal authorities to have the government building under roof before snow flies, and to make the ornamental stucco work inside the building during the cold weather ready to be put in position early in the spring.  It is said by those who know, that the government has always been on time with its building at exery exposition and that the same will be the case with the Omaha building.  As the government building at the Tennessee exposition required but six weeks in its construction from start to finish, it is not difficult to realize that the work will proceed very rapidly after it is once started.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Plan to Run Through Trains from Omaha to Lake Manawa for One Straight Ten-Cent Fare.</head>
                            <p>The proposition of the Lake Manawa Railway company to extend its line to connect with the East Omaha lines, and thence directly to the Exposition grounds, has attracted considerable interest in Omaha and Council Bluffs.  Just at this time when the Bridge line company is pushing its claims for the extension of its charter in Council Bluffs, the new charter that has been partially agreed upon is being closely scanned by many of the leading lawyers, who are convinced that under its provisions a rival company can demand the right to use its tracks where the laying of additional tracks would interfere with street traffic.  They are fortified in this by several decisions of the Iowa supreme court.  The proposition of the Lake Manawa company, which will be presented to the Council Bluffs city council at its next meeting in the form of an amendment to its old charter, will include provisions for establishing a loop in the southern part of Council Bluffs that will enable its trains to reach all the local depots and enter Fairmont park by the way of the new south entrance, which will avoid the necessity of climbing a grade of any consequence and bring the trains directly into the most beautiful part of the park and in the vicinity of the present terminus of the old line.</p>
                            <p>There has been considerable speculation as to where the money for this new enterprise is to come from.  The promoters have authorized Emmett Tinley, attorney for the company, to state that the line is to be built with Council Bluffs capital that is now lying idle.  Mr. Tinley says his company will have the road in operation by the opening of the exposition and be able by that time to give the people of Council Bluffs and visitors to the exposition a direct route to the grounds.</p>
                            <p>East Omaha men and Council Bluffs real estate owners are enthusiastically in favor of the new line and have expressed their belief that if the line is completed by the time the exposition is opened it will carry a large portion of the Iowa visitors to the grounds, for the reason that it will be at least two miles shorter than any other route.</p>
                            <p>Another proposition under consideration which is exciting considerable interest in Council Bluffs is a plan to run through trains from Omaha to Manawa at one straight 10 cent fare each way.  This will remove all objections which have long been made against the smoky old steam trains and bring many visitors to one of the most delightful summer resorts in the west.</p>
                            <p>A. B. DeLong, general manager and secretary of the East Omaha Land company, spent a large portion of the day in Council Bluffs conferring with the promoters of the new scheme.  He announced that so far as his company was concerned it could be counted upon to do all that was possible to aid the enterprise and that the consolidation of the Manawa and East Omaha lines had been practically effected, pending the negotiations for the necessary charter.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Proposals for Furnishing Material to Be Invited.</head>
                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission will hold a special meeting Tuesday of next week for the purpose of taking action on the erection of the Nebraska building on the exposition grounds.  Superintendent of Construction Blake has prepared an estimate of the amount of material which will be required for the erection of this building and it is expected that bids for supplying this material will come before the board at this meeting.</p>
                            <p>There will be a number of other matters which will come before the commission.  Among them will be the application from the Nebraska State Millers' association for 500 feet of space in the Agriculture building in which to make a display of the resources of Nebraska in the way of milling products.  This application is made to the commission by Secretary O. C. Holmes for the millers, who states that the association desires to erect a booth formed of different kinds of grain grown in Nebraska, showing the grain in glass jars.</p>
                            <p>Among the communications of various sorts which have been received by Assistant Secretary Dearing and which will be laid before the commission is a letter from William George Sheppard, the leader of a band at Indianola, Neb., who asks if state bands are to "be given any show" at playing at the exposition, or whether all the work is to be given to "the great eastern bands."  He says he has a band of thirty men and
                            
                            <pb n="23" xml:id="TMISB03-023"/>
                            
                            intimates that an engagement covering all or a part of the period of the exposition would not be objectionable.  It is thought possible that the commission will make arrangements to have music in the state building all the time by engaging the principal bands of the state for short periods during the exposition.</p>
                            <p>W. H. Sutherlin of White Suplhur Springs, Mont., vice president of the exposition for Montana, has written to Assistant Secretary Dearing to ask for office room in the Nebraska building for the Montana Exposition commission.  He says the Montana appropriation is so small that no building can be erected, but that the state will be on hand with a creditable exhibit.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Dudley Smith, commissioner general for the Transmississippi Exposition to England, has written to the Department of Exhibits a very interesting letter concerning his doings since arriving in the "tight little island," which is herewith printed in full:</p>
                            <p>I arrived in London on August 5 after a most delightful trip across the Atlantic.  The captain informed me that they had not had as smooth a passage this year, so I was very fortunate in deciding upon the North German Lloyd steamship Lahn.  I formed some very pleasant acquaintances, who have been of considerable assistance to me since my arrival.</p>
                            <p>Parliament adjourned the day after I reached London, and I have as yet been unable to deliver all my letters of introduction to the different members.  I have met Hon. Michael Davitt, who was most kind to me and he gave me a letter of introduction to Sir Albert Kaye Rollitt, M. P., president of the Board of Trade and also president of the British Brussels commission, who said that if I found the government would not do anything that I could then take the matter up with the Board of Trade, which appointed the Brussels commission, and an organization similar to the Board of Trade had charge of the exhibits at the Columbian exposition.  He stated further that the government never directly recognized any exposition, but when it decided to interest itself it would make an appropriation to the Board of Trade, or some such similar organization, which would take the matter up and appoint a commission.</p>
                            <p>Hon. George Curzon, foreign minister, who I am yet to see, left immediately on the adjournment of Parliament for Scotland, and will not return until September 1.  I have called upon Hon. Spencer Walpole, secretary of the postoffice, who was very pleasant and said he would do what he could to make my mission a success.  I also spent one afternoon with Mr. Thomas J. Lipton (on Mr. Davitt's introduction) and he virtually promised me a Ceylon exhibit and said he would take the matter up with the representatives from India and he thought he could secure me an exhibit from there also.</p>

                            <p>On receipt of your cable I called on the Siamese legation, but found the king of Siam had gone to Scotland, the minister accompanying him.  After explaining the object of my visit to the under secretary he agreed to take the matter up with the king and minister on their return.  I also paid my respects to our ambassador, Colonel Hay, and our consul general, Colonel William McKinley Osborne, both of whom received me very cordially.</p>
                            <p>All the above occurred during my first week, and learning that the great week of the Brussels exposition would occur last week I left last Friday week for Brussels and was over there eight days, where I had the pleasure of meeting Prof. Gore, Jean Verhaegen, Colonel Charles J. Murphy, all of whom are interested in our exposition.  I also had the pleasure of meeting the king of Belgium, who was doing the exposition during my visit.</p>
                            <p>The newspaper La Petit Bleu has quite an extensive exhibit on the grounds, showing the process of first grinding up blocks of wood, then the different stages through which it passes until we see a light-blue paper, which finally comes out on rolls, from which is printed La Petit Bleu, also the linotype machines.  Everything from blocks of wood to a complete printed newspaper is shown in their exhibit.  Mr. Harry, the editor, was very kind to me, and had set up in the machine the following: "Welcome to Hon. Dudley Smith of Nebraska to the La Petit Bleu," which he afterward gave to me as a souvenir.</p>
                            <p>The American exhibit at the exposition is very small, although a number of manufacturers have exhibits here, Great Britain is fairly good, but France and Italy have very large exhibits, France having appropriated, so I am informed, $200,000 for its exhibit, when the United States government only appropriated $5,000.  I also met Sifico, the director concessioner of the Ottoman empire, which includes the streets of Cairo.  He had quite a good exhibit and is quite anxious to come to our exposition.</p>

                            <p>They tell me here that after Parliament adjourns people leave the city as though there was a pestilence abroad in the land and do not get back until the middle of September.  So I may go over to Holland next week, as there is an exposition going on there, and next week is the great fete week, being the queen's birthday, and as that exposition closes on September 1 I would not have an opportunity of seeing it unless I go at once, and I am quite anxious to see how the Dutch took Holland.</p>
                            <p>I could write you a book of my doings since my landing, over two weeks ago, and from the above you can see I am doing quite well.  A weekly paper here called Table Talk gave me a very nice write-up, and on my showing the editor the last pamphlet received from you, showing sketches of the buildings, he said he would be glad to use those pictures of the buildings in this week's paper; also give quite a write-up of the exposition, which I have been all the afternoon getting up for him.  I told him that I would want to send out 400 or 500 copies of this book to all manufacturers and other parties in Great Britain.  This I will do as a matter of introduction before sending out blank applications which I brought with me.</p>
                            <p>I hope to see Mr. Lipton again next Wednesday, when he may be able to decide upon the space wanted for the Ceylon and Indian exhibits.  By the way, Mr. Lipton is very friendly to Omaha, as he started the packing house which is now the Cudahy Packing company, and spoke very favorably of Mr. Cudahy, Mr. McShane, Mr. Paxton and other Omaha people.</p>
                            <p>I have been very well since my arrival and hope this will find everything progressing very satisfactorily as regards the exposition.  With kind regards to all, I remain yours very truly,</p>

                            <p>A model kitchen in which will be prepared in a scientific manner Nebraska's staple product, Indian maize, in all its varied forms, is the scheme proposed by Mrs. Harriet S. MacMurphy of this city to the Nebraska Exposition commission.  Some of the members of the commission are disposed to look with great favor upon the scheme as being a most valuable means of showing the world the great value of corn as a food for man as well as beast, thereby increasing the demand for the crop with which Nebraska can supply the world.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. MacMurphy's plan contemplates the establishment of a kitchen which shall be a model for a housewife, fitted with all the most improved culinary apparatus for preparing food in the most scientific manner.  In this kitchen Mrs. MacMurphy proposes to give daily demonstrations all during the exposition, showing to all visitors who desire to be informed the results of scientific investigations into the art of preparing food for the table in a manner which will insure the best results from the nutrition therein contained.  Mrs. MacMurphy proposes to make a specialty of preparing corn for table use, and for this purpose she proposes to demonstrate by practical methods the very many tempting forms in which this highly nutritious food may be utilized by man.  These delicious preparations will be prepared in plain sight of visitors, and they will then be distributed among the people who desire to have further proof of their excellence.</p>
                            <p>The members of the state commission are disposed to regard this proposition as an excellent one from a business standpoint, as tending to increase the demand for Nebraska's immense corn crops by increasing the consumption of corn meal and corn flour.  They have in mind the experiment along this line conducted by the federal government when it sent "Cornmeal" Murphy to Europe to introduce corn to the tables of the people of those countries.</p>
                            <p>This matter will be taken up by the commission at its meeting tomorrow and some action will be taken on it.</p>

                            <p>It seems probable that a typical Nebraska sod house will form a part of the exhibit to be made at the exposition by the Nebraska exposition commission.  A suggestion to this effect was made to Governor Holcomb by L. G. Stewart of Omaha, who lives at 2412 Wirt street.  The governor referred the matter to the exposition commission with the suggestion that the proposition really involved a concession, but the members of the commission are disposed to take another view of it.  They take the position that such an exhibit would properly be a part of a historical exhibit and that it should be operated on that theory.  It has been suggested that a genuine sod house should be erected on the grounds as a part of the Nebraska exhibit, and that it should be placed in the hands of Dan Freeman of Beatrice, the man who will occupy a place in the history of Nebraska as the first man in the state to take up a homestead.  The suggestion contemplates filling the house with a collection of curios directly connected with the history of the state, forming a most interesting exhibit under the direct charge of the state commission.</p>
                            <p>The matter will receive the attention of the commission at its meeting tomorrow.</p>

                            <p>Efforts are being made to secure the 1898 meeting of the International Association of Fire and Police Telegraph Superintendents for Omaha.  This meeting this year will be held at Nashville, Tenn., September 14-15.  City Electrician E. F. Shurig of this city  has already sent a written invitation to the secretary of the association, extending the body a cordial invitation to meet in Omaha in 1898.  Mr. Schurig is desirous of attending the Nashville meeting, but it is doubtful if he will be able to do so unless he pays his own expenses, as the city government is not disposed to appropriate money for this purpose.</p>
                            <p>The association in question is a comparatively new one but is rapidly gaining prominence and now includes among its members the superintendents of city electrical departments in the largest cities in the land.</p>
                            <p>One of the strongest arguments being used to induce the association to choose Omaha for its next meeting is the fact that already the principal electrical associations of the country have decided upon Omaha as the place for their meetings next year, and this fact, together with the additional fact that it is already assured that the electrical section of the exhibition will be one of the most extensive exhibits of electrical appliances of every kind that has ever been made in this country, is expected to serve as a very strong inducement when the matter is voted upon.</p>

                            <head type="sub">AVOIDING DODGE STREET HILL.</head>
                            <p>Arrangements for the accommodation of traffic next year during the exposition have not yet been decided upon, although the officers of the company have nearly agreed upon the plans they will pursue.  There will be no building of new lines this fall with that traffic in view.  The officers say that the Sherman avenue and Sixteenth street lines each take passengers to an entrance to the exposition grounds, and will accommodate all the traffic which will be carried in that direction this year.  In the spring the company will probably extend the Twentieth street line out to the main entrance.  This line will have to be built over an unpaved street, which is now used as a boulevard, and if put down will be only with the intention of taking up the tracks again after the exposition.  There is said to be no call for another through line to the north part of the city, as the experience of the officials has been that the public would rather walk a few blocks further to connect with a car line with frequent service than to have numerous lines with slow service.</p>
                            <p>In considering the extensions of the Twentieth street line the problem of the Dodge street hill come up again, and the company has almost decided upon a plan to avoid that obstruction to safe and rapid transit.  This plan contemplates the turning of the Dodge street line north on Seventeenth street from Dodge, then to Cass street, then west to Twentieth and then north to the exposition grounds.  Tracks are already laid on nearly all of this proposed line, and it would not require very much expense to put the new route in condition for travel.  Then in the event of heavy traffic trailers could be put on the motor cars.  If this plan should be decided upon, and it seems very probable that it will, the Dodge street hill will be abandoned permanently.  This would give the company three lines to the exposition grounds, as many as could be conveniently handled. By the system of transfers now in use it would give the people in all localities a chance to get to the grounds for a single fare, and all parts of the city would be thoroughly covered.</p>

                            <head type="sub">INCREASED FLOW AT THE ARTESIAN WELL</head>
                            <head type="sub">Experiments Are to Be Continued with the Hope of Starting a Much Greater Stream of Water.</head>
                            <p>The air lift has been connected with the artesian well on the exposition grounds and last night the machinery was started up to test the working of the apparatus.  The mechanism consists of an air compressor, which is operated by a stationary engine, the air making its escape from the compressor under very heavy pressure by way of an iron pipe about two inches in diameter.  This pipe is let down inside the iron tubing which lines the well from top to bottom.  In yesterday's experiment the air pipe was lowered to a depth of about 160 feet.</p>
                            <p>When the air was turned on the water in the well shot up into the air a distance of several feet and those conducting the experiment said the flow was 130 gallons per minute, being about four times as much as the flow without the air lift.  The water was quite muddy, the force of the air seeming to have loosened the sediment on the inside of the pipe.  It is thought that by extending the air pipe further down the well a flow of about 200 gallons per minute may be secured.  These experiments will be continued until the maximum amount of flow is ascertained.</p>
                            <p>For the present the air compressor and the engine which operates it are placed alongside the well.  Those having charge of the experiment were very well satisfied with the result yesterday.</p>

                            <p>C. F. Erickson of this city, who went to Stockholm to visit the Swedish capital and the exposition in the interest of the Transmississippi Exposition, has returned and reports having made very good progress.  He appointed two experienced exposition men to look after the interests of the Transmississippi Exposition.  He states that he has no doubts about the number and quality of exhibits which <choice><sic>wil</sic><corr>will</corr></choice> be secured <choice><sic>form</sic><corr>from</corr></choice> that section of Europe.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Erickson says that he was inconvenienced somewhat by having to correct erroneous impressions existing among Swedish manufacturers regarding the effect of the new tariff law, but he thinks that he has overcome those objections and that the Swedish section will <choice><sic>compapre</sic><corr>compare</corr></choice> favorably with that of the other European countries.</p>
                            <p>In addition to Swedish exhibits, Mr. Erikson negotiated with Russian exhibitors who are at the Stockholm exposition and found them very anxious to learn all about the Transmississippi Exposition.  He says the Russians are reaching out all over the world for a market for their wares and that a number of them will come to Omaha with exhibits of manufactured articles.  At the Stockholm exposition they make a great showing of religious wares of all kinds, such as vestments, embroideries, altar furniture, etc.  Mr. Erikson says they will make very rich displays of these goods at Omaha.</p>

He says that the exhibit made by the country at the Hamburg Horticultural exposition in Germany, won the gold medal, and this exhibit will be used to form a nucleus for the exhibit which will be made at Omaha.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission held a special meeting last night, mainly to take up the question of a state building.  All the members were present.</p>
                            <p>The architects employed by the board submitted a drawing for a change in the plan of the state building, which contemplated a structure slightly larger than the first building, designed along the lines of an order of architecture more in harmony with the design of the main exposition buildings.  The plan showed a building 150x90 feet, two stories in height, with a clear story.  The building was rectangular in form and was designed along the Corinthian order.</p>
                            <p>The adoption of the new plan was urged by Architect McDonald, who said the modified plan was more satisfactory to the supervising architects and would cost slightly less than the first building.</p>
                            <p>The board discussed the plans at length and decided that no change should be made.</p>
                            <p>In reply to direct questions both the architects and Superintendent Blake said the building as originally designed could be built for less than $16,000, Superintendent Blake staking his reputation on the statement that it would not cost over $14,000.</p>
                            <p>The superintendent was directed to advertise for bids for supplying all material which will be required in the construction of the building, bids to be submitted at the meeting of September 14.</p>
                            <p>President Neville was appointed a committee of one to arrange with the exposition management for an agreement whereby the state commission shall have the unquestioned right to provide the state building with such provisions for the comfort of visitors to the building as may be required.</p>

                            <p>At the suggestion of Commissioner Poynter a committee of three was appointed to investigate and report the maximum amount of money which should be set aside for each of the various industries which should be assisted in making exhibits at the exposition.  The chairman appointed Commissioners Poynter, Whitford and Dutton.  The committee will report to the board at the meeting which will be held on the state fair grounds during the progress of the fair.</p>
                            <p>The committee appointed at the last meeting to select a site for the state building reported the location already described at length, being on the bluff tract, a short distance south of the viaduct across Sherman avenue.  The site was approved by the board.</p>
                            <p>A letter from Labor Commissioner Kent was read, setting forth that he proposes to issue an outline map of Nebraska about the first of the year, containing statistics relating to the crops, etc., as well as pictures of the exposition buildings.  He asked the board to have 100,000 of these printed for distribution for advertising purposes.  The matter was laid over for future consideration.</p>
                            <p>The proposition of Mrs. Harriet S. MacMurphy of Omaha, setting forth her plan for conducting a model kitchen during the exposition and asking the aid of the board in demonstrating the advantages of corn as a food was read to the board and was passed for further consideration.</p>

                            <p>When the board convened this morning the state building question came up for further consideration.  Mr. Dutton said he had heard it intimated that the plans for the proposed state building were not designed strong enough to safely hold the crowds of people which would probably visit the building.  He suggested that the plans should be submitted to some competent judge for examination.  This caused considerable discussion among the members of the board.  It was stated that it had been said by the exposition architects that the construction of the building was faulty, and that some of the posts in the second story were not supported from below.  It was also stated that the construction was faulty and that the architects had expressed the fear that the building might collapse under some of the high winds if it was not wrecked by being crowded beyond its strength.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent of Construction Blake was sent for and was asked regarding these matters.  He denied most emphatically that the plans were not ample for a building which would support all the people who could crowd into it.  He explained the manner of construction and said the building would be supported and braced in all <unclear/></p>

                            <p>The matter was discussed fully by the board and it was decided that the plans were satisfactory in <choice><sic>evary</sic><corr>every</corr></choice> respect.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Harriet S. MacMurphy appeared before the board to further explain her proposition for illustrating the manifold uses of corn as a food for human consumption.  She said she had made preparations for operating a cooking school for giving demonstrations, illustrating all kinds of scientific cooking of food, and she desired the assistance of the board in displaying the advantages and methods of using corn in various forms for food.  She explained that her exposition of scientific cooking was simply an educational factor and was not contemplated as a financial venture.  She said she was actuated solely by a desire to educate the race, and her motive in appearing before the board was to ask assistance in illustrating the value of the chief product of the state as a food for man.  The amount of money asked for, she said, was simply to cover the expenses of the exhibit.  She asked $350, which she said would cover the cost of space, the cost of preparing the food and printing a small book of recipes.  This would cover the expense of demonstrations three times each week, or she would give daily demonstrations for $500.</p>
                            <p>The matter was favorably discussed by some of the members of the board with Mrs. MacMurphy, and was finally referred to the special committee appointed to recommend the amounts to be devoted to making various exhibits.</p>
                            <p>N. B. Kendall of Lincoln, president, and O. C. Holmes, secretary, of the Nebraska State Millers' association, appeared before the board to ask that it furnish space for an exhibit to be made by the millers of the state.  They explained the sort of an exhibit they proposed to make and spoke, incidentally, of cooking some of the milling products and distributing the food to visitors.</p>
                            <p>Struck by a <choice><sic>hapy</sic><corr>happy</corr></choice> thought, President Neville introduced President Kendall to Mrs. MacMurphy and advised that they pool their issues on the cooking proposition.</p>
                            <p>The whole matter was finally referred to the special committee for investigation and report.</p>
                            <p>The application for 10,640 feet of space for the State building was made out and signed by President Neville.  This application will be presented to the Department of Exhibits.</p>
                            <p>The assistant secretary was instructed to send copies of the estimates of material required for the construction of the State building to all parties who desire to make bids for furnishing any of the material.</p>
                            <p>The superintendent of construction was ordered to secure the necessary piles and commence at once the work of putting in the foundation of the State building.</p>
                            <p>The commission adjourned to meet again in this city Monday, September 20, at 4 p. m.  Members of the board will remain in the city during the week of the State fair and will hold meetings on the fair grounds for the purpose of getting in direct touch with the various interests which will be represented at the fair.</p>

                            <p>Mr. and Mrs. William N. Babcock returned from a two months' trip along the Atlantic seacoast this morning.  They went east via the great lakes and spent most of their time along the coast of New England.  Mr. Babcock overlooked no opportunities to boom the exposition while away.  Regarding the controversy over the laying of the Missouri Pacific tracks in the exposition grounds, it is stated that there will be a conference between Mr. Babcock, superintendent of the Department of Transportation of the exposition, and the Missouri Pacific officials this afternoon.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PLANING MILL ON EXPOSITION GROUNDS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Local Firm Secures a Lease and Erects a Frame Structure Close to the Main Court.</head>
                            <p>The exposition management is somewhat exercised over the notice received from Insurance Inspector Hartman to the effect that the erection of a frame planing mill just outside of the main court at the northeast corner, and about twenty-five feet back of the Machinery and Electricity building, will increase the insurance rate which must be paid on the buildings on the main court and on the contents of all these buildings.</p>
                            <p>This planing mill was erected recently by Vogel brothers, the building permit being taken out in the name of the Transmississippi Planing Mill company.  These people had a contract with the Department of Buildings and Grounds to occupy the brick building on the bluff tract, but the executive committee refused to approve the contract for the reason that it would be <choice><sic>discriminiating</sic><corr>discriminating</corr></choice> against home institutions which had subscribed to exposition stock.</p>
                            <p>When this plan failed the planing mill people secured a lease of a lot which is at the northeast corner of the main court, enclosed on the east by a portion of the grounds which runs up to Manderson street, and on this they erected a frame building which is covered with tar paper.  This building is almost in direct contact with the fence surrounding the main court and is within a few feet of where the Machinery and Electricity building will stand.  To facilitate access to the mill from the exposition grounds a gate has been cut through the fence, directly back of the mill.</p>
                            <p>After the notice was received from Inspector Hartman, Secretary Wakefield visited the office of the city building inspector and remonstrated with Building Inspector Butler for issuing a permit for such a structure in such close proximity to the exposition buildings.  Mr. Butler said he had no knowledge of just where the main buildings would be located and had simply issued the permit without any reference to those buildings.  The permit being issued, he said the matter had gone beyond his power.</p>
                            <p>Inspector Hartman suggested that the fire risk might be reduced by erecting a brick wall between the planing mill and the exposition grounds, but Chief Redell of the fire department said this would not lessen the danger from fire, as the chips and shavings from the mill would blow all over that part of town and the danger to the buildings would be very great.</p>
                            <p>No official action on the matter has yet been taken by the executive committee.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Proposition Submitted by an Inventor from Missouri.</head>
                            <p>The Transmississippi Exposition management has received another airship proposition.  The inventor of the machine is from Missouri.  He accordingly accompanies his proposition with a cabinet photograph showing a small model of the machine with which he proposes to overcome the attraction of gravity to some extent and soar heavenward as with the wings of a bird.</p>
                            <p>A photograph shows two rectangular frames which intersect one another at right angles.  A small platform rests on the point where the lower sides intersect, and on this is placed the motive power, consisting of a small motor which the inventor says may be operated by compressed air or electricity.  At the extreme outer ends of the upper sides of the frames are placed wheels resembling turbine water wheels.  There are four of these and they are constructed of steel tubing, covered with cloth.  The wheels are twenty-five feet in diameter and are operated by means of shafting.  Running up above the engine is a rod having a universal joint at its upper end and to this is attached another wheel which may be used as a propeller or a rudder.  This constitutes the machine, and the inventor says that the model from which the photograph is taken works successfully.  He says that when the machine is in mid-air and the rotation of the wheels is stopped they act as parachutes, and the machine descends slowly to the earth.  He says that the completed machine will weigh about 500 pounds.</p>
                            <p>The inventor is O. G. Newton of Trenton, Mo., and he asks the exposition people to advance him $300 for the construction of the machine, which he proposes to build on the exposition grounds.</p>

                            <head type="main">NORTH DAKOTA INTERESTED</head>
                            <head type="sub">STATE TO BE REPRESENTED AT EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Vice President Lounsberry Arrives and Tells of Work Being Done to Make a Creditable Display at the Great Show.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Colonel C. A. Lounsberry, vice president for North Dakota for the exposition, is in the city to look over the ground and formulate plans for North Dakota's representation at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>North Dakota has no appropriation, but the legislature created a commission and authorized the members to co-operate with the railroad companies and other corporations, with counties, cities, schools and individuals, and through the co-operation of the several interests in the state the commission hopes to raise at least $10,000 for an exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Lounsberry is one of the commissioners, as well as vice president.  The other two commissioners are Colonel C. B. Little of Bismarck.  In 1873 Colonel Lounsberry established the first newspaper in North Dakota, and is now publishing an illustrated magazine at Fargo.  Colonel Power is the proprietor of the Helendale farm.  Many saw the magnificent painting belonging to the Agricultural department, Washington, which hung at the head of the stairway in the North Dakota building at the World's fair.  The painting was by Carl Guenther and was purchased by the United States government as a typical farm scene.  The scene was from Colonel Powers' farm and the horses were from life as found on his farm.  Colonel Little is president of the First National bank, Bismarck, and a state senator.  So that it would seem North Dakota has chosen its representative citizens for the work.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Lounsberry's visit is preliminary to organizing.  He hopes North Dakota will be able to take 10,000 feet in the Agricultural building.  The state has no interests in mines, excepting lignite coal, cement and clay, none in horticulture, and, therefore, purposes concentrating whatever display it makes in the Agricultural building.  The commissioners will probably have their offices and reception rooms in this space.  The state has important stock interests which will take their appropriate place.</p>

                            <head>NORTH DAKOTA RESOURCES.</head>
                            <p>Said Colonel Lounsberry: "North Dakota was poor a year ago in taxable resources and in available public funds, but the people of our state have $1,500 surplus from their crops this year for every family, or about $300 for every man, woman and child in the state.  We have 50,000,000 bushels of wheat which will bring us $37,500,000; 4,500,000 bushels of flax, worth $4,500,000; 9,000,000 bushels of barley, worth $3,000,000; 28,000,000 bushels of oats, worth $7,500,000; 3,000,000 of potatoes, worth $1,500,000; 2,000,000 pounds of wool, worth $240,000; poultry and eggs, worth $1,800,000; milk products worth $2,500,000, and live stock and meats worth $10,000,000, making a total of $68,290,000 for paying debts, for betterments, and a surplus of a few millions which our people can spend in attracting attention to our unparalleled resources and in having a good time at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Only six counties of our state are thickly settled.  There are millions of acres subject to entry under the homestead act and many millions which may be purchased on the crop payment plan where half the crop frequently more than pays for the land the first year, and many millions more which may be purchased at $5 an acre.</p>
                            <p>"Our crop was late and we have needed the hot weather to mature it, but the wheat crop of North Dakota will pay this year an average profit of $10 an acre over and above the cost of production.  As we had 3,500,000 acres in wheat, you can see what we rely upon for our ready money.</p>
                            <p>"With such resources and a disposition to show them, you can rely upon North Dakota coming to the front with a nice exhibit.  We gained our first great boom from the New Orleans exposition, at which we had a fine exhibit.  The World's Fair did not bring apparent results, but we look for an immigration of 100,000 people next year and know the value to us of the Transmississippi Exposition."</p>

                            <p>The question of railway trackage on the exposition grounds seems in a fair way to be settled within a very few days and then the tracks of the Missouri Pacific will be completed along both sides of the main court and across Sherman avenue from the bluff tract, so that the material for the construction of the main buildings may be hauled directly to where it will be used.</p>
                            <p>Manager Babcock of the Department of Transportation held a meeting yesterday afternoon with Messrs. Rathbun and Phillippi of the Missouri Pacific and a form of contract was agreed upon.  This contract was executed on the part of the exposition authorities this morning, President Wattles and Secretary Wakefield attaching their signatures to it, and it was then forwarded St. Louis for execution by the railway officials.  No further tracklaying will be done until the contract is fully executed.</p>
                            <p>The terms of the contract are briefly and concisely stated and the ambiguous wording which characterized the original document is entirely eliminated.  All of the points in the original contract to which objections were raised by Superintendent Owens of the Department of Transportation have been omitted and the document complies with the requirements insisted upon by Manager Babcock's department.  It is provided that the railway company shall lay, extend, remove or relay the tracks as may be directed by the exposition management without any cost to the exposition.  The moving of care inside the grounds shall be under full charge of the exposition, through its authorized officers.  The railway company agrees to furnish an engine and crew for the exclusive use of the exposition within the grounds whenever desired by the exposition.  The tracks inside the grounds are to be in full charge of the exposition management and it is stipulated that the tracks may be used by the latter for the operation of miniature trains during the exposition if it is desired to do so.  The section of the contract referring to switching charges provides that a uniform charge of $4 per car shall be made for all loaded cars switched to or from or within the grounds, regardless of how many times the car may be handled inside the grounds, but it is provided that this charge of $4 per car shall not be considered a part of the usual switching charge on business with connecting lines.</p>

The plans submitted by the inventor of this new method of locomotion shows a double track of single steel rails, suspended about fourteen feet above ground on cross arms attached to posts much after the fashion of a trolley line, with the posts between the tracks.  On these rails are operated bicycles so constructed that the wheels are over the riders' heads instead of being beneath the riders, as in an ordinary bicycle.  The machines are propelled in the same manner as a bicycle, each machine or carriage carrying two riders.  The lower part of the carriage is seven feet above the ground.  The inventor is a Waco, Tex., man named Martin and he wants the privilege of installing his apparatus on the exposition grounds as a means of transporting people about the grounds.</p>

                            <p>John E. Hallett of Valley Springs, S. D., is the inventor of a coast defense vessel which he wishes to operate at the exposition as a concession and he has made application to the Department of Concessions for the privilege.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hallett says he will transform his engine of death and destruction into a harmless merry-go-round which will disport in the lagoon and afford amusement to those who are not especially interested in the mechanical ingenuity displayed in the invention.  Mr. Hallett's vessel resembles nothing so much as a tub.  It is perfectly round and is fitted with propelling apparatus, which is arranged so that the boat may be whirled about in the water or may be propelled in any direction.  When used for a coast defense vessel it is designed to be surmounted by an armor clad turret, but for the purposes of the exposition the inventor proposes to construct a series of promenade decks diminishing in size as the height from the water increases.  On these passengers will be carried and the boat will travel about in the lagoon.</p>

                            <p>Goldie &amp; Sons, Chicago, contractors for the carpenter work on the Mines and Mining building, are shipping into the exposition grounds a complete planing mill outfit which they propose to set up inside the Mines building and turn out their material as fast as needed.  They will at once commence the work of cutting off the piling that is now in place and will construct the floor of the building first, so that their machinery may be set up as soon as possible.</p>
                            <p>The floor of the Mines building will be about four feet above the ground level at the west end and it will therefore be necessary to lay the floor so that the workmen can get about.  Lumber is on the track and the cars will be set on the track back of the site of the building as soon as the connection is made across Sherman avenue.  The work on the piling is provokingly slow, only about one-quarter of the piles being now in place.  Little can be done by the contractors until the pile-drivers, who are employed by the exposition, get out of their way.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Committee Says Two Motor Lines Will Not Handle Crowds from Council Bluffs and Asks a Daily Train Service.</head>
                            <p>The regular meeting of the executive committee of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi Exposition association was held in Council Bluffs last night, with a fair representation of the members present.</p>
                            <p>The Union Veteran Legion submitted a request for the help of the association to secure the next national meeting of the legion at Council Bluffs.</p>
                            <p>The greater part of the evening was spent in the discussion of the report of the special committee selected to secure permanent headquarters for the association for the year.  No definite action was taken, and the committee was given further time to look around.</p>
                            <p>The chairman of each of the seven subcommittees was instructed to report estimates of the amount of money that would be needed to carry on the work in hand and contemplated.</p>
                            <p>A resolution was passed requiring all members of the general committee who had not been prompt and regular in their attendance at the meetings of the committee to give a reasonably good explanation of their absence and show why their names should not be dropped from the membership rolls.  It was decided to amend the constitution at the next meeting, two weeks hence, to permit the filling of the vacancies in the committee.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Test of the transportation committee reported the belief of his committee that the two transportation lines, the present motor company and the proposed Manawa extension, would prove inadequate to carry the people from the Iowa side of the river to the exposition grounds and that the committee had been in conference with the management of the Union Pacific Railway company relative to the operation of a number of daily trains to the grounds.  He presented a communication from President Wells of the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs line stating that his company was negotiating for facilities over the Omaha Street railway lines that will enable the company to land its passengers at the gates of the exposition.  General Test also stated that his committee was in communication with the Western Passenger association, asking assistance in the effort to secure morning trains on all of the roads.  The object is to have trains arrive in Council Bluffs at an early hour each morning and leave late in the afternoon so that exposition visitors would have a full day on the grounds.  While the subject of transportation was under discussion a very strong sentiment was developed among the members favorable to giving the street car lines every possible encouragement to give a perfect service.</p>
                            <p>The committee on literature reported the completion of the write-up of Council Bluffs, and the article was read by the chairman.  It met the approval of the general committee and was ordered to be printed in pamphlet form.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition held its regular weekly meeting at the Commercial club rooms yesterday afternoon.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Lindsey, manager of the Department of Ways and Means, reported that he had not been active of late in  pushing the securing of subscriptions to exposition stock, as he had felt that the prevailing sentiment in Omaha desires to see something going up in the way of buildings before more subscriptions can be secured.  He said that as soon as work was actively under way at the grounds he would take up the work of canvassing the city thoroughly, and believed that a satisfactory amount could then be secured.  In this connection Mr. Lindsey read a financial statement prepared by the secretary, showing that the contracts for the construction of buildings and other work which are now outstanding, amount, in the aggregate, to about $160,000.  In addition to this the contract for the Agriculture building will be let today, it being estimated that the building will cost about $56,000.  The amount of cash now in the treasury was stated to be $137,000, in addition to which it was stated that the park commission will repay to the exposition management about $13,000, which has been expanded by the exposition on the portion of the main court, which will be known hereafter as Kountze park, making a cash balance of about $150,000.</p>
                            <p>The question of the delay in the construction of the Manufactures building was brought up, and it was stated that Contractor Strehlow is now four weeks behind on his contract.  This delay was attributed to a scarcity of cars, in which to ship the lumber to Omaha from Wisconsin.  It was stated that the lumber is white and yellow pine, and is being furnished by H. F. Cady, and that he says the lumber is all cut and will be along in due time.  The advisability of using hemlock lumber from another section of the country was discussed, but no action along this line was taken.  Some of the members of the committee criticised the superintendent of construction for not bringing this matter to the attention of the committee sooner, and also for not taking steps to prevent delay in the erection of the buildings.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">COMMITTEE WAS NOT NOTIFIED.</head>
                            <p>The superintendent of construction also came in for certain criticism in connection with the erection of the frame fire trap against the exposition fence which is to be used as a planing mill.  It was the sentiment of the committee that Geraldine should have warned the committee of the dangerous building which was being erected almost against one of the largest buildings on the grounds instead of cutting a gate through the fence and facilitating access to the grounds from the planing mill.</p>
                            <p>The application of the Nebraska Exposition commission for 10,640 feet of space on the bluff tract for the Nebraska building was laid before the committee by President Wattles, acting manager of the Department of Buildings and Grounds.  The application contained provisions in which the commission asked for certain designated "public comforts" in the state building, such as the privilege of having office room in the state building, operating cigar, lunch and news stands for the convenience of visitors to the state building, etc.  Mr. Wattles recommended that the application for space be granted when it was made to comply with the rules of the exposition by being accompanied by drawings showing the plans and full details for the construction of the building.  He also recommended that the following privileges be granted in the building, provided no charge is made for the same by the state commission: Desk or office room for states not erecting their own buildings; postoffice, check rooms, telegraph and telephone exchanges, subject to the rules enforced by the exposition; reading room, room for accommodation of the state press, music and auditorium privileges, toilet rooms, subject to the rates for water, etc., in force on the grounds; the police for the building to be subject to the rules and regulations of the exposition.  It was further recommended that the privilege of conducting stands for the sale of newspapers, fruit, cigars, etc., be referred for future consideration.  The recommendations of the acting manager were adopted after discussion.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles submitted a proposition from the estate of A. J. Poppleton for the use of the land in Sulphur Springs addition, which will be used by the exposition, being the lower portion of the bluff tract.  The proposition provided that the exposition <unclear/> chased by the exposition management, would have cost $8.  The bill was, therefore, ordered reduced to the latter amount.</p>
                            <p>The next to attract attention were three bills for lumber used for constructing a temporary bridge across the lagoon at Twentieth street.  These bills amounted to $216.84, and investigation showed that D. Geraldine, superintendent of construction, had bought the lumber without going through the required form of securing a requisition as provided by the rules of the exposition.  Mr. Wattles said Geraldine had told him the bridge was absolutely necessary for contractors in hauling their material onto the grounds for the erection of the buildings, but the president stated that he had no personal <choice><sic>knowledeg</sic><corr>knowledge</corr></choice> on the subject.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">GERALDINE'S METHODS DISTASTEFUL.</head>
                            <p>The members of the committee expressed their strong dissatisfaction at the arbitrary methods of the superintendent of construction in purchasing material in direct violation of the rules and having the bills sent in for payment after the material had been used, and there was no recourse but to pay them.  No one knew whether the rule requiring competitive bids to be secured had been observed or not.</p>
                            <p>Out of this discussion developed the fact that a former employe of Geraldine on the Chicago drainage canal, named Tam, had been on the pay roll for nearly a month without any action on the part of the executive committee.  A request for the appointment of Tam was made by Acting Manager Wattles about two weeks ago, but the matter was laid over for the reason that the committee decided that there was no immediate necessity for increasing the pay roll by the addition of another high-salaried man.  It was stated yesterday that Tam's name appeared on the pay roll for last month, the time indicated on the pay roll showing that he had been employed some time before the request for his employment was made to the committee.  No action was taken on the matter.</p>
                            <p>Another matter which was referred to was an item appearing on the pay roll, showing that the head draughtsman in the office of the supervising architects was on the list for $60 for sixty hours' overtime during the month for August, in addition to his regular salary of $208.33.  There was some comment on the fact that this same man had been paid but $1,800 per year for the same work at the World's fair, but is now receiving $2,500 per year, in addition to being furnished transportation to and from Chicago each month to visit his family; but no action was taken.</p>
                            <p>It was announced that Collector Rhoades had resigned and Collector Copeland was ordered laid off for the present.</p>
                            <p>The committee will meet at 5 o'clock this afternoon to open the bid on the Agriculture building.  The contract will be awarded at once in order to expedite the work as much as possible.  A blank contract will be prepared and will be filled in as soon as the lowest and best bidder is known and he will be asked to execute it forthwith.</p>
                            <p>Before the committee adjourned the action of the last meeting in instructing the chairman to request the board of directors to change the plan of organization to make the president a member of the executive committee was reconsidered, and the matter was laid over until a full attendance of the members of the committee can be secured.</p>

                            <p>The Transmississippi and International Exposition is to be boomed in the south by another party of Nebraskans.  On the evening of Saturday, October 2, there will leave this city over the Wabash railroad a party of six-five Nebraskans, bound for Texas.  They will occupy two Pullman sleeping cars and they will be gone eight days.  Twenty-five members of the party will be from Omaha, and the remaining forty will be prominent representatives of the leading towns in the state.</p>
                            <p>The party has been organized by the Real Estate exchange, and will go to Galveston to attend a convention of the Deep Water Utilization committee of the south.  This meeting will convene on October 5.  It was to have been held earlier in the year, but was unavoidably postponed.  The Nebraska party will go from here to Kansas City.  From there south to Fort Worth they will travel via the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas railroad.  Fort Worth, Galveston, Houston and Austin will be visited, and the party will then inspect the rival ports of Sabine City and Port Arthur.  The trip northward will be made over the Kansas City, Pittsburg &amp; Gulf railroad.</p>
                            <p>The committee of the Omaha Real Estate exchange having the matter in charge has worked indefatigable for the success of the excursion.  The necessary transportation has been secured throughout and a representative party of Nebraskans has been made up.  The committee will make official application to the exposition management for a large quantity of exposition literature to take along on the trip, and will also ask for the appointment of the two best exposition orators that can accompany the party to make addresses at all point where stops will be made.</p>

                            <p>Acting Manager Wattles recommended that an auditorium be located in the south-east corner of the main court, at Sherman avenue and Pinkney street, the building to have a seating capacity of 4,000 and to cost not to exceed $15,000.  The recommendation was adopted and plans were ordered drawn for such a building.</p>
                            <p>A proposition from the Fidelity and Casualty company to take up the personal bond given by Contractor Strehlow on the Manufactures building and give the exposition a surety company bond on his contract was accepted.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles announced that the plans for the Liberal Arts building had been completed and that bids for the construction of the building had been called for, to be opened September 18.  He also announced that Colonel Lounsberry, vice president for North Dakota, had filed a formal application for 10,000 feet of space for that state's exhibit.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles, as acting manager of the Department of Exhibits, reported an application from Miss Mellona Butterfield of Omaha for a position in the Ceramic department.

                            <head type="sub">Vice President Shurtliff Contemplates Showing the Plan of Irrigation Along with the Resources of His Adopted State.</head>
                            <p>Utah has made formal application for space in the Transmississippi Exposition.  The application is made by L. W. Shurtliff, vice president for the exposition.  He asks for 3,000 feet, saying that this is simply preliminary and that more space will be taken as the arrangements for the state exhibit progress.</p>
                            <p>The applications from states desiring space in the exposition are coming into the Department of Exhibits with encouraging rapidity.  It is known that arrangements for taking space are well under way in a number of the states and that when all are in the transmississippi region, as well as states not west of the great Father of Waters, will be represented in a most creditable manner.</p>
                            <p>Utah applies for space in the Agriculture building, but information is given that exhibits will also be made in some of the other buildings, so that the aggregate amount of space will make a good showing.  The plan of Utah's exhibit, so far as it has developed, contemplates an extensive irrigation exhibit and numerous other features showing the many resources of the state to the best advantage.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Prof. Day Predicts that the Exposition Will Be a Success.</head>
                            <p>President Wattles has received a letter from David T. Day, Ph.D., chief of the Bureau of Mines of the United States geological survey, who was in Omaha recently to look into the facilities for the exhibit to be made in the government building by the survey.  Prof. Day informs the president that he has made a report to Charles E. Wolcott, director of the survey, to the effect that his visit to Omaha was most satisfactory and that the prospect was very good for the Transmississippi Exposition proving a greater success than any exposition in which the government has participated except the World's Fair, and that the plans being followed by the Transmississippi Exposition are far more sensible than those adopted for the World's Fair.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Day also states that he has been informed by Prof. Clark, the representative of the Interior department on the board appointed by the government for the Transmississippi Exposition, that a meeting of the representatives of the various governmental departments on the board will be geld at Nashville, October 4, and that President Wattles would be invited to be present at that meeting.</p>

                            <p>Further proofs of the activity with which Dudley Smith, the commissioner general for the exposition to Great Britain, is pushing the interests of the exposition to the front in the English metropolis are being received almost daily at exposition headquarters.  The latest indication of the ability of the "member of the lower house of parliament for Nebraska" to get the exposition before the English public in an attractive form is shown in copies of Table Talk, a London weekly society publication.  The issue of August 28 devotes a full page to cuts of the main buildings grouped in a most artistic manner and printed in a manner which brings out their strong points in forcible style.  In addition to this a full page is devoted to reading matter descriptive of the plan and scope of the exposition and the importance of English manufactures and the British government being well represented in the great fair.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith writes that he has mailed copies of this paper to all the prominent manufactures of Great Britain and to the official of the government.</p>

                            <p>A letter has been received at exposition headquarters from Thomas J. Pennell, formerly a resident and prominent musician of Omaha.  The letter is written from Florence, Italy, where Mr. Pennell has been for the past year studying music.  Under date of August 29, the writer makes application for the position of musical director of the exposition.  He states briefly and clearly his views of the manner in which the musical department of the exposition should be conducted in order to make it a success from both a musical and a financial standpoint.</p>

                            <p>The Board of Directors of the exposition held its regular monthly meeting yesterday afternoon.  The board was in session just long enough to read the minutes of the last meeting and pass a motion to adjourn.  There was a quorum present, but after the minutes had been read no one seemed to have anything to offer, and the executive committee had nothing to report, so the meeting was adjourned without further delay.</p>

                            <p>State Labor Commissioner A. Rozelle of Missouri has prepared for the management of the Transmississippi and International Exposition of Omaha a statement of Missouri's productions and their value in 1896, a copy of which is published in the St. Louis Globe-Democrat.  Be it remembered that, excepting the first seven items, this includes only the products actually marketed, excluding the output of all factories except flour mills.  Allowing the usual ratio of consumption to production, imperial Missouri's productions last year aggregated in value $400,000,000.</p>
                            <p>Missouri contains 42,685,600 acres of land, almost 25,000,000 acres of which are now in actual cultivation in grains, fruits, vegetables and grasses.  The aggregate production of the "farm staples" of Missouri for 1896, with their values, computed at current market prices, was as follows:</p>

                            <p>President Wattles has received a letter from David T. Day, Ph.D., chief of the Bureau of Mines of the United States geological survey, who was in Omaha recently to look into the facilities for the exhibit to be made in the government building by the survey.  Prof. Day informs the president that he has made a report to Charles E. Wolcott, director of the survey, to the effect that his visit to Omaha was most satisfactory and that the prospect was very good for the Transmississippi Exposition proving a greater success than any exposition in which the government has participated except the World's Fair, and that the plans being followed by the Transmississippi Exposition are far more sensible than those adopted for the World's Fair.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Day also states that he has been informed by Prof. Clark, the representative of the Interior department on the board appointed by the government for the Transmississippi Exposition, that a meeting of the representatives of the various governmental departments on the board will be held at Nashville, October 4, and that President Wattles would be invited to be present at that meeting.</p>

                            <p>Further proofs of the activity with which Dudley Smith, the commissioner general for the exposition to Great Britain, is pushing the interests of the exposition to the front in the English metropolis are being received almost daily at exposition headquarters.  The latest indication of the ability of the "member of the lower house of parliament for Nebraska" to get the exposition before the English public in an attractive form is shown in copies of Table Talk, a London weekly society publication.  The issue of August 28 devotes a full page to cuts of the main buildings grouped in a most artistic manner which brings out their strong points in forcible style.  In addition to this a full page is devoted to reading matter descriptive of the plan and scope of the exposition and the importance of English manufactures and the British government being well represented in the great fair.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith writes that he has mailed copies of this paper to all the prominent manufactures of Great Britain and to the officials of the government.</p>

The letter is written from Florence, Italy, where Mr. Pennell has been for the last year studying music.

                            <p>The detail plans and drawings for the buildings on the main court of the exposition have now all been completed except the Government building and the Auditorium.  The latter is to be erected in the extreme southeastern corner of the main court, where it will be almost out of sight from the grand promenade so that its exterior appearance will not be material in the ensemble as seen from the banks of the lagoon.  The last building to be completed is the Liberal Arts, the building which is to stand immediately west of the Manufactures building and form an annex to the latter.  This building was only determined a short time ago and the plans for it have been rushed through with all possible speed.  The drawings and specifications have been completed and bids for the erection will be opened Saturday of this week.</p>
                            <p>The Liberal Arts building was designed by Fisher &amp; Lawrie of this city and the full working drawings were made by them.  The completed plans show a building somewhat different in exterior appearance from the other buildings in the main court.  It is rectangular in form, being 240x130 feet in size, and is marked by the fact that, unlike the other buildings of the main court, it has no central motive, but depends for effect upon the grouping of the corner pavilions.  The general style of the building is French renaissance.  It presents the appearance of a rectangular mass, with the corners accentuated by square pavilions with pediments, each pavilion being surmounted by a group of statuary.  The general style of the front is that of a low stylobate surmounted by a colonnade, the height of both being about forty feet.  The wall surfaces between the pavilion are treated with double colonnades with windows between.  The general treatment is on broad lines with large wall surfaces rather than by dividing the design into minor parts.  The ornament is French renaissance.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Likely to Secure a Swedish Exhibit for the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>Prof. J. H. Gore commissioner for the exposition to Sweden, writes from Stockholm that he has been investigating the matter of securing a Swedish exhibit and is meeting with success.  The plan nearest the heart of the professor is one contemplating the securing of a Swedish village, but he says he finds that the experience the Swedish people had with the World's fair people in this direction was not such as to warrant the belief that another attempt of that kind could be successfully made.  He suggests, however, that if the Swedes of Omaha and vicinity would form an organization and invite the people now having exhibits at the Stockholm exposition which would be appropriate for use in such connection to come to Omaha with their wares such effort would undoubtedly succeed.</p>
                            <p>In this connection President Wattles makes this suggestion that the organization of Swedish citizens of Omaha who have already incorporated for the purpose of taking part in the exposition should take this matter in hand and bring about the result hinted at by Prof. Gore.</p>
                            <p>Referring to a general Swedish exhibit, Prof. Gore says he is negotiating with numerous manufacturers who have exhibits at the exposition and feels quite confident of securing an exhibit which will be representative.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Concessions has received a proposition which eclipses anything yet received in the way of novelty and interest.  It is forwarded by Dudley Smith, commissioner general for Great Britain.  It is an application from an English firm for a concession for a baby incubator.</p>
                            <p>The firm in question proposes to put in a number of these incubators and have them in full operation during the exposition.  Enclosed with the application are a number of clippings from English newspapers containing cuts showing the exhibit made by this firm at the exposition now in progress in London.  These cuts show a long row of these machines, each having its tiny inmate, which the foot note says are from five to eight months old.  The lusty-looking <choice><sic>younsters</sic><corr>youngsters</corr></choice> are fed from reservoirs seen at the side of the machine, while complicated apparatus serves to keep the temperature and air of the interior at the proper point.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The Iowa exposition commission has issued a stirring proclamation to the people of that state, calling upon them to put their shoulders to the wheel and help to push the state to the position it should occupy in the agricultural and manufacturing columns.  The circular letter containing this exhortation is the work of a special committee of the Iowa commission, composed of Sylvanus D. Cook, Robert H. Moore and James E. E. Markley.  The address is as follows:</p>
                            <p>To the People of the State of Iowa:  Iowa being the pivotal state of those embraced in the wide territory known as the transmississippi as regards wealth, enterprise, education and all that goes to make a great state, the people of Iowa are especially interested in the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898.  This exposition will be held for the purpose of exhibiting the products, manufactures, arts and industries of the twenty-four states and territories included in the transmississippi belt.  It has been nationalized by act of congress and aided by a liberal appropriation.</p>
                            <p>The Twenty-sixth general assembly of Iowa passed "an act to provide for an exhibit of the resources of the state at the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha in the year 1898, which was approved by the governor April 17, 1896.  The commission appointed under this act asks your co-operation in carrying out the expressed intent&#8212;"that the agricultural, mineral, mechanical, industrial, educational and every resource and advantage of the state of Iowa be creditably represented."</p>
                            <p>At the Centennial exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 Iowa took the gold medal on farm and dairy products.  At the world's fair in Chicago Iowa made an exhibit of her agricultural, horticultural, dairy and live stock interests that did great credit to the state.  All the world knows of Iowa and its agricultural wealth and possibilities.  The world also knows that in point of education Iowa leads.</p>
                            <p>The Transmississippi and International Exposition will afford an opportunity that has not hitherto been presented to Iowa, not only to advertise her agricultural wealth, but also to show the possibilities of developing a great manufacturing state.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">OPPORTUNITY FOR IOWA.</head>
                            <p>The Transmississippi and International Exposition offers the best opportunity that has been presented for Iowa to advertise her vast possibilities.  The World's fair and Centennial exposition were so overcrowded with foreign exhibits that the west was overshadowed.</p>
                            <p>The coal fields of Iowa are sufficient to run all the manufacturing interests of the entire northwest.  The water power that is undeveloped at one point alone on the Mississippi river near the Iowa shore is equal to 45,000 horse power.  This could be made equal to an annual income of more than a million and a quarter dollars.</p>
                            <p>Experimental tests of sugar beets in Iowa have shown beyond the question the possibility of making beet sugar one of the leading industries of the state.  Sugar beets in Nebraska are bringing the farmers about $80 an acre.</p>
                            <p>Take as a basis a commercial point in Iowa, draw a circle taking in a radius of 200 miles, and you will find more railroads and river outlets for commerce than in the same extent of territory any place in the world.  But the Iowa cattle and hog producer must at present find his market in Chicago.  The farmer who depends upon the sale of grain for the profits of his farm, either directly or indirectly, finds his market east or south of the borders of his own state.  The Iowa wool grower ships his clip to the eastern seaboard.</p>
                            <p>Iowa has not risen to her opportunities.  Her wealth is often invested in moonshine that flickers so bewitchingly over the hills of the gold and silver bearing states of the far west.  We can point you to one little city of less than 8,000 souls, where the business men have squandered more than $1,000,000 in less than a decade on mining stocks and boards of trade.  The people of Iowa do not realize the possibilities in the way of manufacturing at home.  Why should the beet sugar industry prosper in Nebraska and the Iowa farmer continue to sell corn at 15 cents?  Do towns in Illinois across the Mississippi, afford any better field for the making of farm machinery than a point on the Iowa side?  People of Iowa, cast your eyes over the border limits of your state, see what your neighbors are doing, and then tell us why Iowa cannot excel them.</p>

                            <head type="sub">INTERESTING FOREIGN CAPITAL.</head>
                            <p>Capital is necessary for success in new fields of industry.  Iowa has capital and Iowa capital should be used in developing the latent resources of the far-famed agricultural and dairy state and in building up home markets.  Foreign capital would naturally be drawn by the magnet, "faith at home," and Iowa, with her vast agricultural resources and her own artisans, would supply her own people and the world with finished goods and would indeed become the pride of the transmississippi group of states.</p>
                            <p>This exposition can be made a source of profit to Iowa beyond all computation.  The time is now ripe for investments in new lines.  There has never before been a time in the history of the country when there was so much idle capital as there is today.  Idle capital means idle laborers  Iowa should form a working ground for these mutual interests.  The capitalist and the laborer can join hands in Iowa and develop the natural and latent resources of the state to an extent heretofore undreamed of.</p>
                            <p>Money is necessary to make an exhibit that will do credit to the state.  Only $10,000 has been appropriated.  It will require $50,000 more to do the work at all creditably.  The farmers and stockmen cannot afford the expense of an exhibit without the aid of the state.  The same is true in other departments.</p>
                            <p>State interest as well as state pride calls for a requisite appropriation.  The exhibition will be held at our western border, and Iowa will receive a large part of the direct benefit which falls to the country immediately surrounding any great exhibition.  It is probable that Iowa will reap as much direct benefit from eastern travel and transportation as will Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>The commissioners appeal to all the people to join in making an exhibit that will bring practical results, and expect that those engaged in agriculture, horticulture, stock raising, manufacturing and all other industrial lines of work will at once begin preparation for the exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The liberal arts department should make an exhibit commensurate with the vast sums of money the state is spending for the education and elevation of its people.  Fine arts and the department of woman's work should be especially successful in this exhibition.</p>
                            <p>Please address the commissioner of the department in which you wish to exhibit.  On all general matters address the secretary of the commission.</p>

                            <p>If the funds are to be eaten up by additional high salaried men from abroad at the will of Geraldine, it is against the whole management, as gross negligence characterizes the whole work in hand.</p>
                            <p>Next we are told that the head draughtsman had put in a bill for $60 for sixty hours overtime in the month of August in addition to his regular salary of $208.33 for the same month.</p>
                            <p>Why was this overtime necessary when there are plenty of draughtsmen walking the streets of Omaha, and who would be glad to get sixty hours work? Why, it looks as if the whole enterprise was "the meat" of Geraldine and his gang, and that nobody in this locality was to profit from it.</p>
                            <p>The "head draughtsman" seems to have a pretty soft snap.  He received $1,800 for his services in Chicago, but our "generous" management pay him $2,500 and transportation every month to visit his family in Chicago.

                            <head type="sub">He Looks for a Rake-off from Every Contract--What Influence Keeps Him?</head>
                            <p>The people of Omaha, as a rule, are a patient people, but we think that their patience with the management of the exposition stamps them as very lambs who willingly stand up to be sheared of their wool by Geraldine and his henchmen.</p>
                            <p>We took a stroll over the exposition grounds and find the work progressing as if the directory were afraid the construction would be finished too soon.  Any practical workingman could see that not one man was at work where 100 could profitably be employed to advantage.  The only thing that seemed numerous was Geraldine's bosses and spies, which were largely in evidence.</p>
                            <p>Gangs of two men each were spiking planks on the face of the lagoon piling; two men were driving spikes and a boss was standing with his hands in his pockets seeing that they drove the nails properly.</p>
                            <p>This kind of supervising may have been all right in Chicago, but it is quite too costly for Omaha people.  We are accustomed to pushing work with a less per centage of bosses.</p>
                            <p>Judging from the proceedings of the executive board held last Friday, no body of men seems to know less of the work going on than the exposition executive committee.  The Omaha Bee says:</p>
                            <p>The next to attract attention were three bills for lumber used for constructing a temporary bridge across the lagoon.  These bills amounted to $216.84, and investigation showed that Dion Geraldine, superintendent of construction, had bought the lumber without going through the required form of securing a requisition as provided by the rules of the exposition.  Mr. Wattles said Geraldine had told him the bridge was absolutely necessary for contractors in hauling their material onto the grounds for the erection of the buildings, but the president stated that he had no personal knowledge on the subject.</p>
                            <p>Now, we would like to know by what right Geraldine constructs temporary bridges, wagon roads, etc., for the accommodation of contractors and paid for out of exposition funds?</p>
                            <p>What business is it of his how contractors get their material on the ground? or is he a silent partner in these contracts, that he spends the people's money for the benefit of contractors?</p>
                            <p>If the purchasing department were not as many "bumps on a log" they would not have to express their dissatisfaction with Geraldine's arbitrary and unwarranted methods.  If they were honest and competent for their positions Geraldine would not dare to purchase material in violation of the rules and send in the bills for payment after the material had been used.  The proceeding is, to say the least, "shady," and looks like a steal on the face of it.</p>
                            <p>It is not gratifying to find that the management have been carrying men on the exposition pay roll nearly a month unknown to the management.  This is not creditable to the <choice><sic>manage-management</sic><corr>management</corr></choice> in making such a contract.</p>
                            <p>Taking the whole management into consideration the directors should be ashamed of themselves.</p>
                            <p>At the executive board session last Friday the three Geraldine members attempted to railroad through the board a recommendation to the directors that Wattles be made a full member of the executive board with the right to vote.  Had this been permitted to become a law Geraldine would have four votes solid and all hades could not force him to loosen his graft on the exposition, but Rosewater told them a thing or two as to what he would do at the big director's meeting and the Geraldine men were afraid to go up against the game.  That is why there was no business to transact at the directors meeting Friday.</p>
                            <p>The people will not stand this swindling much longer and the sooner the directory takes the construction and general work out of Geraldine's hands and fires him bodily, and conducts the enterprise with proper economy and honesty the better it will be for the reputation of the board, who, up to now have not given the people satisfaction in the construction department.</p>
                            <p>Fire Geraldine!</p>

                            <head type="sub">Contractors Have Commenced the Erection of Another Structure in the White City&#8212;Working on Mines and Mining Building.</head>
                            <p>The Manufactures building is beginning to loom up, the erection of the uprights having been commenced this morning.  The first portion of the building to rise above the ground level was the circular dome which is to form the main entrance.  The framework which is to form the center of the massive square columns which will support this dome have been put in place and the skeleton of the dome will soon rise skyward, overlooking the lagoon.  The columns stand on a circle fifty feet in diameter and forty feet in height.  The columns are square and alongside of each, on the outer edge of the circle, will soon appear a smaller round column, the dome resting on all of these.  The dome will be seventy-five feet in height when completed and will be handsomely ornamented.</p>
                            <p>The long timbers which have delayed the erection of the Manufactures building have commenced to arrive, and Contractor Strehlow says he will now push the building as fast as possible.  While he has been waiting for this timber he says he has had his men framing the other timbers for the building so that no time has really been lost, as the work will move all the faster when the actual work of erection commences.  As soon as the long looked for timbers arrive on the ground a large force of men will be put to work and the building will rapidly assume form.</p>
                            <p>The vicinity of the Mines and Mining building is assuming an animated appearance.  Goldie &amp; Sons, carpenter contractors, have a large amount of their material on the grounds and have erected a small shed for storing some of the material.  The work of trimming off the piles has been commenced and is being pushed as rapidly as possible.  A slight delay has been caused by difficulty in getting timber for piling as rapidly as it is wanted.  About three-quarters of the piles have been driven and these are being straightened up and trimmed off preparatory to putting on the sills, but the contractor who supplies the piles has been rather slow and the work has been delayed in consequence.  There is about two days' work for the pile drivers and then the work of construction will commence in earnest.  The machinery for getting out the lumber is on the ground and will be put in the building as soon as the floor is completed.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Transportation of the exposition has taken up the matter of securing special rates on all railway and steamship lines for exhibits of all kinds which are to be placed in the exposition.  Letters have been sent to all of the transatlantic, transpacific and coastwise steamship lines trading with South American ports, asking them to make special rates on foreign goods intended for exhibit at the exposition so that the agents of the exposition in foreign countries can conduct negotiations intelligently with foreign exhibitors.  Letters have also been sent to all railway lines asking them to concede to the Transmississippi Exposition the treatment accorded to former expositions.</p>
                            <p>The department has also requested the customs collectors at all ports of entry in the United States to advise the department as to the railway lines from their respective ports which transport goods in bond in order that the department may be able to indicate to foreign exhibitors the lines over which goods in bond may be shipped.</p>
                            <p>The first circular of the Department of Transportation announcing freight rates has been issued.  It announces that, "on shipments of carloads of material consigned to or shipped from the exposition grounds, in addition to the regular freight charges, there will be a charge of $5 per car for switching services from Oak Chatham station, on the Belt Line railway, to all tracks controlled by the exposition."</p>

                            <p>The blank petitions asking the Board of County Commissioners of Douglas county to submit a proposition for voting county bonds in the sum of $100,000 to the voters of this county at the next election have been prepared and issued by the promotion bureau of the Department of Publicity and Promotion, and have been distributed all over the county.  They have been sent to the postmasters in the small towns in the county and have been distributed all over Omaha and South Omaha.  They are in the cigar stores, barber shops, business houses, railway headquarters, retail establishments and all other places where voters congregate, and are being signed rapidly.  The law requires that 1,000 signatures must be attached to such a petition before the county commissioners are authorized to submit the proposition to a vote of the people.</p>
                            <p>In order to guard against duplication of signatures it is desired to secure 4,000 or 5,000 signatures so that there may be no question about there being 1,000 fully bona fide signatures.  The time is short within which to secure these signatures, and it is desired that all who can do so assist in circulating these petitions for signatures.  Blank petitions may be obtained by calling at the office of the promotion bureau on the sixth floor of the Paxton block.</p>

                            <p>The promotion bureau of the Department of Publicity and Promotion is working up the project of organizing an advisory board to have charge of the agricultural congresses which it is proposed to hold in connection with the conventions of the many societies of agriculture and kindred industries.  Letters have been sent to prominent representatives of these industries asking them to consent to serve on this advisory board and replies have commenced to come in.  A letter was received this morning from Theodore Butterworth, editor of the Western Agriculturist and Live Stock Journal, accepting the invitation extended to him and containing several suggestions regarding the organization of such a board.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Butterworth suggests that those who are to constitute the board meet in Chicago during the fat stock and horse show to be held there this fall and organize for the work.  He also suggests the formation of a group of congresses under the general head of a congress of agriculture and that each congress be placed in charge of a chairman who shall work up the details and carry out the plan under the general direction of the central body.  He predicts that a number of very successful congresses will grow out of the movement and announces his entire willingness to co-operate in every possible way.</p>

                            Lee Wah Village company to bring into this country 400 Chinamen to take part in the Chinese village at the Transmississippi and International Exposition.  This is the concession which has been represented in Omaha by Hong Sling the Chinese agent of the Union Pacific road.  Sling secured the concession for a Chinese village at the exposition, the village to include a joss house, theater, restaurant, bazaars, etc.</p>
                            <p>Considerable delay has been experienced by the fact that the secretary of the treasury was not disposed to grant authority for bringing in Chinese artisans and artists, for the reason that the secretary had acquired the idea that the imported Chinamen seemed to melt after their arrival in this country and it was, therefore, impossible to enforce the condition which provided for their deportation to their native country at the expiration of a stated period.  The secretary refused to grant the authority until the management of the exposition made the request that it be done, and it is probable that the exposition is made responsible for the return of the Celestials after the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The granting of this authority opens the way for the granting of like authority to Wong Chin Foo, the Chinese commissioner, who has also requested permission to bring into this country artisans and mechanics from the north of China to take part in the Chinese section in the Manufactures building.</p>

                            <p>A semi-subterranean retreat has been constructed about the upper end of the pipe which rises out of the artesian well at the exposition grounds.  This forms a room about ten feet square, the roof of which is level with the ground outside.  The water has two outlets&#8212;one at what will be the water level when the lagoon is completed and filled, and the other about five feet above that point.  When the air lift is not in operation, the water flows out of the lower pipe, but when the pressure is turned on the water rises in the pipe and flows out of both outlets.  A small faucet has been let into the main pipe and visitors may draw water in their jug or tin cup, which is furnished by some philanthropist.</p>
                            <p>The water from the well now flows into the lagoon.  A box has been <choice><sic>agganged</sic><corr>arranged</corr></choice> beneath the pipe so that the water will not wash away the bottom of the lagoon and the crystal fluid flows in every direction.  With only the natural pressure, the flow is about thirty-five gallons per minute, but when the air lift is in operation the flow is increased to about 130 gallons.  The pipe of the air lift has been extended further down the well and is now about 190 feet below the surface of the ground.  At this depth a pressure of eighty-five pounds of air is required to lift the water.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, Sept. 13.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Secretary Gage this afternoon decided he would grant permits for the admission of 400 Chinese for the Omaha Exposition.  The secretary had a long conference with Hip Lung, a Chinese merchant of Chicago, this afternoon, who is at the head of the Mee Lee Wah Village company, and who has obtained a concession for an exclusive right to exhibit Chinese at the exposition.  Hip Lung made a strong argument to have the secretary permit 500 Chinamen to come into the country.  Hip Lung will leave in a few days for China to organize and bring back with him his company.  Secretary Gage has restricted to three months the time the Chinese may remain in the country.  It has been ascertained that of the 400 Chinese allowed to go to the Tennessee Exposition a large percentage have disappeared, and it will be impossible to get them out of the country.  Under the permit granted for them they were allowed to remain in the country for a year.</p>
                            <p>Acting Secretary of War Meiklejohn has ordered the issuance of a revokable license to Prof. J. A. Gillespie, late superintendent of the Institute for the Deaf and Dumb at Omaha for two buildings on the Fort Omaha military reservation, in which he contemplates the founding of a private school for the deaf and dumb.  Superintendent Gillespie has also been appointed custodian of the entire reservation.  The license is now being prepared and will in all probability be signed by the acting secretary tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>The continued illness of Secretary Alger has prompted Acting Secretary Meiklejohn to forego his vacation for the present, at least in view of the fact that the secretary contemplates a quiet sojourn at some of the Atlantic coast resorts, where he hopes to regain his health.  Until the secretary returns, therefore, Mr. Meiklejohn will be in <unclear/> the war department.</p>
                            <p>The queen regent of the Netherlands, through Minister Stanford Newell, has recognized receipt of an invitation to the Transmississippi and International Exposition to the Netherlands government to be represented at Omaha next year and has communicated her regrets to the American government that she cannot send an official representative to the exposition.  The correspondence shows, however, that the prospectus of the exposition will be given official recognition in Netherlands journals and will invite chambers of commerce and manufacturers in that country to make a display.</p>
                            <p>With the return of the president efforts will be made at once to secure the appointment of a chairman of the government exhibit board to the Omaha exposition.  Departments have named the following representatives: State, William H. Michael; Treasury, Charles E.

                            <head type="sub">WALKING DELEGATES ARE TURNED DOWN</head>
                            <head type="sub">Staff Workers on Exposition Buildings Propose to Manage Their Own Affairs, Independent of Dictates of Labor Unions.</head>
                            <p>The staff workers employed by the contractors who are doing the staff work on the exposition buildings have formed a labor union among themselves.  The membership of the new union is about twenty, this being the number of men at present employed by L. Bonet and Smith &amp; Eastman, the only staff contractors who have established plants on the grounds.  As the work progresses the number of men employed will be largely increased, and will probably reach 200 or more.  The new union has been incorporated and officers elected.  The officers are as follows: Guerin Perino, president; Peter Pali, vice president; John Gonnella, treasurer; Emil Weber, recording secretary; James Burdo, financial secretary.</p>
                            <p>This action on the part of the staff workers was the direct result of an attempt on the part of certain representatives of the local union of the plasterers to dictate to the staff contractors who they should employ and the amount of wages which should be paid.  These representatives waited on the staff contractors and informed them that they must pay a certain scale of wages or there would be trouble.  They also indicated that members of the local plasterers' union should be employed instead of bringing men from the outside.  Inquiry of these walking delegates developed the fact that the plasterers' union contains about twenty members, none of whom understand the handling or working of staff.  The men employed by the staff contractors are all experts in their line, all of them having been employed for years in the manufacture of staff and stucco work.</p>
                            <p>After considering the matter the contractors came to the conclusion that it would  be disastrous to think of employing men who were utterly ignorant of working staff.  It was also realized that a failure to comply with the demands of organized labor, however unreasonable, meant a strike of the other workmen employed on the exposition buildings.  As a solution of the difficulty, the men employed by the staff contractors formed an organization and carried the matter further than is usually done with labor organizations by filing regular articles of incorporation.  Thus an incipient strike was nipped in the bud and the walking delegates took credit for another organization added to the list.</p>

                            <p>The carpenter work of the Administration building is almost completed, there remaining but a few finishing touches to be added before the last carpenter descends from his lofty perch at the summit of the lantern which surmounts the tall building.  In the meantime the work of putting on the staff has been progressing rapidly under the archway, through which the throngs of exposition visitors will pass to reach the north tract.  The staff covering beneath the arches is taking the form of massive ribs, resting upon a heavy cornice at each side of the arch.  The effect is most pleasing and is to be still further enhanced by the addition of rosettes about one foot in diameter which are to be placed between the ribs.  The work is proceeding rapidly and an idea may now be obtained of how the building will look when completed.</p>
                            <p>Contractor Bonet has completed a large amount of the staff work for the Administration building and a great deal of it is stored in the lower part of the structure ready for the workmen.  For covering the entire building, about sixty tons of raw plaster will be required, and a considerable portion of this has already been made into castings.  The remainder will be put on the building much after the fashion of mortar.  This latter method is only practical for plain surface, of which there is only a limited amount on this particular building.  As soon as the carpenters have finished their work on the building the staff men will commence on the outside where their work will be more in evidence.</p>

                            <p>The laying of the sewer on the bluff tract and north tract of the exposition grounds has been completed. The contractor was John F. Daley.  No contract for this work has ever been submitted to the executive committee by the Department of Buildings and Grounds for approval, but after receiving bids from several contractors for furnishing the material and laying the pipe, Daley was ordered by Superintendent of Construction Geraldine to go ahead with the work.  Inquiry of several contractors who bid on the work, including Daley himself, developed the fact that there were no specifications, so far as they knew, and the quality of the pipe which was put in the sewer trenches is a conundrum.  The matter has been the subject of inquiry several times in meetings of the executive committee, but Mr. Geraldine is reported to have stated that "No contract was necessary."</p>
                            <p>A contract with Daley was filed with the secretary this morning after the auditor had refused to make a voucher for the payment of an estimate allowed the contractor by Geraldine.</p>

                            <p>H. Albert Johnson, United States consul at Venice, has notified the exposition that he will be pleased to assist in any way in securing exhibits for the exposition.

The work will be pushed as rapidly as possible.</p>
                            <p>Thomas T.

                            <head type="sub">RECOMMENDS A MUSICAL DIRECTOR.</head>
                            <p>Another important matter which was laid before the executive committee was a report and recommendation by Manager Lindsey regarding the formation of a plan for the operation of the musical bureau of the exposition and the appointment of a musical director.  The report of Mr. Lindsey was as follows:</p>
                            <p>To the executive committee of the Transmississippi and International Exposition:  I hereby recommend the employment, under the rules of the exposition of A. Rommel, of the Mount Pleasant Conservatory of Music of Mount Pleasant, Ia., as musical director of the Transmississippi and International Exposition, upon the terms and conditions herein stated, and I also submit his plan, which I approve, subject to change and modification in detail.</p>
                            <p>Plan&#8212;The music should be divided into two classes, one for amusement pure and simple, the other for the purpose of showing the advancement the art of music has made in the western states compared with the industrial arts.</p>
                            <p>For Amusement&#8212;Band concerts; promenade concerts by orchestra; daily afternoon performances by band; concerts by orchestra and soloists consisting of popular programs; operatic concerts; musical extravaganzas, such as musical tableaux, and the like.</p>
                            <p>Or showing the advancement of music in the west&#8212;Symphony concerts; oratorio performances; production of works by composers living in the west.</p>
                            <p>To carry out the above plan an orchestra and a band would be needed of skilled performers.  As many as are competent would be engaged from among musicians in Omaha and vicinity.  For an orchestra of about fifty performers and a band of about forty-five the cost would be about $1,200 per week.  The additional expense would be the procuring of music, either by rental or purchase and the salaries of director and two assistant conductors, one for orchestra and one for chorus.</p>
                            <p>Sources of Income from Music&#8212;Recitals by noted artists; concerts by orchestra and soloists consisting of popular programs; operatic concerts; musical extravaganzas; symphony concerts; oratorio performances; production of works by composers living in the west; state concerts.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SOURCE OF INCOME.</head>
                            <p>By state concerts are meant concerts given by representative musical bodies of the different states, from which they would receive half the proceeds and free admission to the grounds on the day of the concerts.  Two of the above performances would be given each week.  Oratorio performances or symphony concerts would take place Sunday afternoons, and the other concerts would take place on an afternoon or evening during the week.  This would give forty-four performances on a large scale, which, properly managed should yield an average income of $1,000 each, amounting to $44,000 during the season.</p>
                            <p>There should be free band and orchestral music if possible both afternoon and evening, except at the time of the pay performances.  For marches, processions on special days, fireworks etc., the band would be ready to render service.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rommel would take full charge of the music of the exposition, giving all the time necessary for successfully carrying out the above plan for the sum of $2,500 for the entire period from now until the close of the exposition, agreeing if elected to take $1,000 worth of exposition stock; salary to be paid monthly from the beginning of the engagement; all necessary traveling expenses to be paid, including hotel bills except while in Omaha and in Mount Pleasant.</p>
                            <p>Assistant conductors for chorus and orchestral work would not be under pay until the opening of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>I have known Mr. Rommel personally for over twenty-five years.  He is known throughout Iowa and Illinois as a musician of great ability, a man of good business qualifications and bears the reputation of being an honest man.  He is a German and received a thorough musical training in Germany, coming to America when a young man about 22 or 23 years of age.  He first settled in Baltimore and afterward removed to Burlington, Ia.  He was called to Mount Pleasant to take charge of the music in one of the educational institutions, and for many years has successfully conducted the Mount Pleasant Conservatory of Music, besides being director of music in the Iowa Wesleyan college of that place and director of music in Parsons college, Fairfield.  He is a member of the American College of Musicians, incorporated in New York, from which he received the degree of Mus. Doc., and has held the position of vice president of the National Music Teachers' association.  In 1892 Mr. Rommel received a gold medal from the Iowa Music Teachers' association for the best instrumental composition.</p>

                            <p>Frederic Grant Gleason, the well-known composer, says: "I regard Mr. Rommel as an exceptionally well educated musician.  He has made a thorough study of harmony, counterpoint and fugue (single and double), besides devoting considerable attention to free composition and orchestration.</p>
                            <p>George Ellsworth Holmes and Charles W. Clark, well known oratorio singers both speak in terms of warmest praise of Mr. Rommel's ability as a conductor and musician.  James A. Guest, the most prominent dealer of musical merchandise in Burlington, says: "I have known Mr. Rommel for many years.  He is regarded as one of the best musicians in the state.  He has shown himself particularly efficient in directing the production of performances of large works.  He has given many extensive choral performances, as the 'Messiah,' 'Creation,' 'Elijah,' etc., and they have always been successes."</p>
                            <p>Hans Albert of this city says: "I regard Mr. Rommel as one of the best known musicians in this country, one for whom I have the most profound respect and admiration.  During our business relations about seven years ago I had a fine opportunity to observe Mr. Rommel's remarkable executive ability, which is on a par with his musicianship."</p>
                            <p>Through his own exertions Mr. Rommel has acquired considerable property and has good financial standing in the community in which he lives.  Mr. Rommel is a very conservative man, fully appreciating the stupendous nature and accompanying expense of a great exposition, and if elected would conduct the musical department in the most economical manner possible.  Respectfully submitted</p>

                            <p>Action on the matter was deferred until Friday of this week, the day of the regular meeting of the committee, to give the members an opportunity to consider the details of the plan suggested by Mr. Lindsey.</p>

                            <head type="sub">THREE MORE CONVENTIONS FOR NEXT YEAR</head>
                            <head type="sub">Old-Time Telegraphers, the Military Telegraphers and the Superintendents of Cemeteries Decide to Come to the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>The list of conventions which will meet in Omaha next year continues to grow.  Scarcely a day passes without at least one more convention being added to the already long list.  Yesterday's record shows the addition of three more gatherings for exposition year, consisting of the Old-Time Telegraphers' association, the Association of United States Military Telegraphers and the Association of American Superintendents of Cemeteries.  The two first named organizations have been holding their meeting in Nashville and Omaha was selected as the place for the meeting next year.  Colonel J. J. Dickey, superintendent of the Western Union Telegraph company in Omaha, was elected president of the Old Timers' association, and Edward Rosewater, one of the delegates from Omaha, was elected vice president of the Military Telegraphers' association.</p>
                            <p>The selection of Omaha as the next place of meeting by these two societies was largely the work of Mr. Rosewater.  He was aided in the work by the fact that when the associations met in this city five years ago they were royally entertained and the members had very pleasant recollections of the visit.</p>
                            <p>The Old Timers' association is composed of persons who were telegraph operators twenty years before the date of their application for membership.  The Military Telegraphers' association is composed entirely of operators who were in the military service of the government during the war.  The membership of this latter organization, like that of the Grand Army of the Republic, is rapidly dwindling, but the membership of the other society is increasing.  The total membership of both societies is about 1,000.  When the associations met in Omaha five years ago there were about 250 strangers in attendance, including the wives of several of the members.  The sessions usually continue about two days and conclude with a banquet.</p>
                            <p>This morning word was received that the city has bagged the next year's meeting of the Association of American Cemetery Superintendents, and in order to make the chain complete the local undertakers have gotten an additional hump on themselves to get the 1898 meeting of the International Undertakers' association.</p>
                            <p>President J. Y. Craig of the Forest Lawn Cemetery association telegraphed this morning to the effect that the next meeting of the Association of American Cemetery Superintendents had been secured for Omaha.  He is the only delegate from this state in attendance at this year's meeting, which is being held at Cincinnati, but his lone efforts did the work.  The gathering is expected to bring to the city about 1,000 people, as the number of delegates in attendance is usually about 500 and they are ordinarily accompanied by their wives and families.  The session will last about four days.  Every city of any size in the country is represented in the association.</p>
                            <p>The International Undertakers' association meets in Milwaukee next month.  A delegation is going from this state to capture the next year's meeting.  This contingent is composed of Undertaker Heafey of this city, Roberts of Lincoln, Warner of North Platte and Bell of Norfolk.  This meeting will also bring about 500 delegates and their families.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition met last evening, with three members present.</p>
                            <p>The contract and bond of William Fitch for laying the water pipes on the exposition grounds were approved, the bond being for $1,800, with the United States Fidelity and Guaranty company as surety.</p>
                            <p>The contract and bond of Hamilton Bros. for the Machinery and Electricity building was also approved, the bond being in the sum of $10,000, with the American Surety company of New York as surety.</p>
                            <p>A resolution prepared by President Wattles as acting manager of the Department of Buildings and Grounds was adopted, providing that the action of the executive committee in awarding the contract for laying the sewer on the bluff and north tracts of the exposition grounds to John F. Daley be filed with the secretary as the only necessary contract and that the action of the Department of Buildings and Grounds and the president, in that connection, be approved.</p>
                            <p>As a forestallment of this action of the committee a document had been filed with the secretary earlier in the day.  This document consisted of a copy of the journal, showing the action of the executive committee in awarding the contract to Daley, and a letter written to Daley by Superintendent of Construction Geraldine, dated August 29, notifying Daley of such action and ordering him to proceed at once with sufficient force to complete the work by September 15.  Daley's acceptance was noted in ink on the face of the order, with his signature, and the signature of President Wattles attached, no date being written in either case.  Attached to these two documents was a copy of the printed specifications used by the city of Omaha in its sewer contracts.</p>

                            <p>Mrs. James Baird of Iowa Park, Tex., has been appointed one of the members of the advisory board of the Women's Board of Managers of the exposition.  Mrs. Baird is a sister of N. P. Dodge of Council Bluffs and has been visiting him during the summer.  She was at exposition headquarters this morning in consultation with Secretary Ford of the Women's board regarding the functions of members of the advisory board.  The appointment of Mrs. Baird to this position is regarded with a great deal of satisfaction by the members of the executive committee of the Women's board, as they say she has an extensive acquaintance in Texas and will be of great assistance to the board.</p>

The pamphlet will contain new matter entirely, together with several cuts of the main buildings which have not yet been published.  The demand for the literature issued by this department is enormous, and the people who call for it say they want it to mail to their friends and business acquaintances in all sections of the country.  The department is continually crowded to supply the demands which are made upon it for the pamphlets, pictures, etc., which are being issued as fast as the printing presses can turn the manner out.</p>

They were grown at St. Francis, on the western edge of Nebraska, the section of the state that was once known as "the arid region."  The potatoes were planted on May 15, and have been cultivated once a week since then.  They were grown under the principles of the Campbell system of soil culture by A. R. McCullum.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Bids for State Building to Be Opened Next Monday.</head>
                            <p>The superintendent of construction for the Nebraska Exposition commission has let the contract or supplying the piles necessary for the foundation for the Nebraska building to P. A. Gavin of Omaha.  Negotiations are pending with several parties for driving the piles.</p>
                            <p>Bids for furnishing all the material required in the erection of the Nebraska building will be received at the headquarters of the state commission until noon on Saturday of this week.  These bids will be opened by the commission at a meeting to be held next Monday at 7:30 p. m., at which time it is expected that the contracts for supplying the material will be awarded, and that the superintendent of construction will be ordered to proceed at once with the erection of the building.</p>
                            <p>Inquiry at exposition headquarters developed the fact that the state commission has not yet complied with the rules of the exposition by filing its application for space, complete plans and specifications for the building it proposes to erect to be passed on by the executive committee before space is allotted the state board.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska commission will open headquarters on the State fair grounds next Monday, and will maintain these headquarters during the fair.  The State Fair board has assigned the commission space in the Horticultural building and Secretary Dearing will have his office there during the week.  All the members of the state commission will be at the fair grounds during the progress of the fair to get in touch with exhibitors.</p>

                            <p>Superintendent Hardt of the Department of Exhibits feels sure that the Canadian exhibit at the exposition will be very extensive.  He bases this opinion on interviews he has had with W. J. White, the representative of the Canadian government who was in this city for the purpose of installing a Canadian exhibit at the State fair.  Mr. Hardt states that the fact that a new government is in power in Canada will be a strong factor in the exposition's favor.  He says he feels certain that the Dominion will make a fine exhibit showing its resources.  Mr. White told Mr. Hardt that after he had installed the State fair exhibit he would devote several days to the exposition and would make a thorough investigation with a view of making an exhaustive report to his government.</p>

Mr. Mischke writes to the Department of Exhibits that Mining Commissioner Lee, who is a member of the exposition commission, is in the field all the time with two experts, collecting mineral specimens for the Colorado exhibit, the intention being to add these specimens to the extensive collection already in possession of the state.  This entire collection now fills six rooms in the Colorado capitol building.  Mr. Mischke writes that the collectors have not yet visited the Cripple Creek or Breckinridge districts.</p>

Among other things, he says he expects to close a deal with a large fruit ranch in Raton for space for an extensive exhibit.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles has received a letter from the representative of the United States Fish commission on the Transmississippi Exposition, making inquiries regarding the water supply and pressure at the exposition grounds, and stating that the commission will probably install an extensive fish exhibit, similar to the one at the Nashville exposition.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The general committee of the Council Bluffs Exposition association held its regular meeting in Council Bluffs last evening and discussed matters connected with the work of the association.  The most important action taken was the determination of the committee to incorporate and give the organization a legal status.  This matter was brought up by E. H. Walters while the subject of finance was under discussion.  He called attention to the fact that each member of the committee was personally liable for the debts of the organization, and as it was likely that the committee would handle considerable money and become involved in expenditures of large sums there might be some undesirable sequels and afterclaps.  With the organization properly incorporated under the state laws the individual members of the association could not be liable for any debts and deficits that might remain when the work of the association was closed next year.  The suggestion met a favorable response, and the officers of the association were directed to prepare articles of incorporation and submit them at a special meeting to be held in the city building on Monday evening.</p>
                            <p>The committee on literature submitted the matter that was designed to be used on the official letterhead of the association.  Several suggestions were made, making alterations and additions, and it was referred back to the committee and Secretary Judson for that purpose.  One of the suggestions was the preparation of a small map in outline showing the location of the exposition grounds, their nearness to Council Bluffs and accessibility by railway and street car lines.  It was thought advisable to design this map so that it could be used on the backs of envelopes sent out by business men, and should become Council Bluffs' distinctive exposition seal.  In this way the nearness of the grounds to the hotels and the central part of the city could be made very prominent and advertised all over the country.  The committee and the secretary were ordered to have printed at once 5,000 of these letterheads and envelopes.  The write-up of Council Bluffs was also referred back to the literature committee for some changes and emendations that the general committee thought advisable to incorporate in it.</p>

                            than November 15.  Mr. Walters, chairman of that committee, thought with the association properly incorporated and all danger of personal liability removed, the committee would have far less trouble in raising the money required.</p>
                            <p>The suggestion of a general local exhibit free to all and in a prominent locality was considered at some length.  Mr. Bixby believed that a good plan would be to lease the lower floor of the Eiseman building and use it for the general headquarters of the committee and for the local exhibit, assigning space to each township in the county.  This exhibit was not intended to interfere in any way with the proposed exhibit in the exposition, but as simply an additional effort to show the resources of the county.  The rental of the large room, which contained more floor space than was contained in either of the Sioux City corn palaces, was fixed at $2,500 for the year, and this amount was not thought to be excessive in view of the fact that nearly half of the sum would be required for the rental of suitable headquarters elsewhere.  No action was taken, but the matter was looked upon with considerable favor, and may become a part of the big schemes of the association.  A new committee was appointed to take up the headquarters question and incidentally consider this also.  The committee is composed of W. A. Maurer, H. W. Binder, Dr. Barstow and M. Wollman.</p>
                            <p>General Test submitted a resolution, asking the assistance of the women in making an attractive educational, horticultural, artistic and floral exhibit.  Mr. Test, as chairman of the transportation committee, also reported favorable correspondence with several of the railroad companies concerning transportation matters.  The Union Pacific announced that through trains would be run from the Broadway depot to the State Fair grounds.  He reported that President Wells of the motor company had assured his committee that the company would run its motor trains to the gates of the exposition next year, and give the best service it could under the conditions that might then prevail.</p>

                            <p>The list of conventions that will be held in Omaha during exposition year continues to grow at a rapid rate, and scarcely a day passes that some gathering of importance is not secured.  The latest convention that has fixed upon Omaha is the National Good Roads parliament, now in session at Nashville, Tenn.</p>
                            <p>At noon today Prof. Taylor telegraphed that by a unanimous vote the delegates in attendance upon the annual session of the National Good Roads parliament had decided to meet in Omaha in 1898.</p>
                            <p>The National Good Roads parliament is one of the largest conventions secured, it being attended by nearly 5,000 delegates, who come not only from all of the states of the union, but from many of the foreign countries.  The sessions usually continue for a week.  With the convention comes a large number of inventors and men who are interested in road working machines.  In addition to the delegates and those who naturally follow the convention, representatives of the government are interested, an appropriation being made for the display of the machines that the United States has used in dredging and improving the highways that are under its direct control.</p>

                            <p>About a dozen of the florists of Omaha, together with the officers of the Douglas County Horticultural society, met in the rooms of the Board of Park Commissioners in the city hall last night to discuss the matter of a Douglas county floral exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
                            <p>President Adams of the Horticultural society occupied the chair, and an informal discussion of the matter now under consideration occupied the time for about two hours.  President Marshall and Vice President Hadkinson of the Nebraska Horticultural society were present and took part in the discussion.  It was the concensus of opinion that a creditable floral display should be made by the Nebraska florists at the exposition, especially in view of the fact that the National Society of Florists would hold its annual meeting in Omaha during the exposition.  It was also stated that the only florists in the state who are so situated as to be able to make any kind of a display are located in Omaha.</p>
                            <p>After discussing the best manner of bringing about a fine floral exhibit it was decided to appoint a committee of three to prepare an estimate of the amount of space which will be required for a good exhibit, together <gap/> filled in a creditable manner, the committee being instructed to report to an adjourned meeting to be held at the same place Saturday night of this week.  It was also decided that when the amount of space and other details are determined the Nebraska Exposition commission would be asked to set aside a portion of the state appropriation for the purpose of securing space and providing for the other expenses for the exhibit.  The matter will be laid before the state commission at its meeting Monday of next week.</p>

                            <p>The Colorado Exposition commission has asked the governor of Colorado to increase the number of commissioners by adding representatives of interests which are not now represented on the board.  They ask that Colonel Hooper, the well known general ticket and freight agent of the Denver &amp; Rio Grand Railway company, be made a member of the commission, and that two members be added to represent the educational interests of the state and one member to represent the coal and iron trade.</p>
                            <p>A letter from Secretary Mischke of the commission to the Department of Exhibits states: "Mrs. Emma Homan Thayer, a member of the commission who is well known to Omaha, has returned from a visit to Omaha and has made a most enthusiastic report to the commission of the progress which has been made by the exposition management in promoting the enterprise.  Mrs. Thayer informs the commission of the work which has been done and which is being done by the exposition people.  She has aroused a great deal of enthusiasm among the other members of the commission."</p>
                            <p>The letter of the secretary also states that the commission took up the matter of erecting a separate building for the Colorado exhibits, but concluded, after full consideration, that the best results would be accomplished by exhibiting Colorado's products in the various buildings where they properly belonged in order that opportunity for comparison might be had.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Publicity recently mailed special letters to United States consuls throughout the world, enclosing illustrated pamphlets and soliciting the co-operation of the officers of the government in promoting the Transmississippi Exposition in foreign countries.</p>
                            <p>Replies have been received from a number of the officials.  All are uniformly cordial in tone and many of then contain suggestions which may prove of great value.  Juan I. Casanova, vice consul at Cienfugos, concludes his letter thus: "You may be sure that this office will do all in its power to forward the desires of the managers of the exposition."  Consul Andrew D. Barbord, City of Mexico, tenders his kindly offices.  Consul William W. Canada, Vera Cruz, says: "I place myself subject to your orders; am willing to do all I can to assist the project."  Consul Pulaski F. Hyatt, Santiago de Cuba, says, in part: "It will afford me great pleasure to do all in my power to aid in advancing the interests of your great undertaking.  It has occurred to me that it would be well to forward to our consuls abroad a limited number of complimentary invitations to place where, in the judgment of each consul, such invitations would do the most good."  Other replies are very similar in tone, and the department will follow up this line of operation.</p>

                            <p>General Charles F. Manderson this morning received an answer from the Navy department at Washington to his request, made sometime ago, that parts of the old battleship "Omaha" to be sent to this city for exhibition at the Transmississippi and International Exposition and for permanent keeping in the city public library after the close of the exposition.  Theodore Roosevelt, assistant secretary of the navy, has given the matter careful consideration, and as a result of his investigations the billet-head and the bell of the battleship will form a part of the army and navy exhibit of the exposition here next year.</p>
                            <p>In his letter to General Manderson Assistant Secretary Roosevelt states that the billethead and the bell are the only parts of the old battleship, which now does duty as a quarantine station at Mare Island, on the Pacific coast, that are feasible to exhibit.  As for the permanent exhibition of these parts in the public library, the Navy department suggests that it would take a special act of congress to authorize the transfer.  General Manderson thinks that this could be secured without difficulty.  The picture of the "Omaha" now on exhibition in the public library is said to be very faithful representation of the battleship in which a new interest has been recently created in this city.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Energy of the Management Turned to Pushing the Work that There May Be No Delay or Failure.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>At the regular meeting of the executive committee of the Transmississippi Exposition yesterday a general discussion arose among the members of the committee regarding statements that are said to be in circulation in certain quarters to the effect that the exposition will not be opened on time, June 1, 1898.  The members of the committee who were present united in saying most emphatically that there would be no failure to have the gates opened promptly on time and that every energy was being turned to that end.  In this connection the secretary was instructed to furnish the committee with a statement, showing the contracts already let for the buildings, the date of the contracts and the date at which the buildings are required to be complete.</p>
                            <p>The action taken at the meeting last Saturday night in awarding the contract for the carpenter work on the Agriculture building to the Congress Construction company of Chicago was reconsidered and the contract for this work was awarded to Goldie &amp; Sons of Chicago.</p>
                            <p>When the bids for the Agriculture building were opened it was found that the Congress Construction company had offered to do the carpenter work for $28,569, but it was stipulated that painting and glazing and piling were not included.  The next higher bid, on its face, was that of Goldie &amp; Sons of Chicago, $39,440.  The bid of W. H. Parrish of Omaha was $39,874.  Goldie offered to deduct $1,000 for piling if done by the exposition, while Parrish offered to allow $1,700 for the same item.</p>
                            <p>At the meeting yesterday afternoon President Wattles, as acting manager for the Department of Buildings and Grounds, reported that the Congress Construction company, when notified that it was the lowest bidder, had said a mistake had been made in the figures and that the figures given did not include a lot of items beside those specified in the bid.  The president of the company, Gustave Ehrhart, came to Omaha with affidavits to show that a large number of things had been omitted in the schedule from which had been made up the lump bid.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">FORFEITING ITS CHECK.</head>
                            <p>President Wattles served notice on Mr. Ehrhart to sign the contract within twenty-four hours or forfeit the check of $400 which accompanied the bid.  This time expired at 10 o'clock yesterday morning, and Mr. Ehrhart appeared with a lawyer and said he was ready to sign the contract, but insisted on being allowed to put his construction on the bid, excluding all the roofing material, translucent material proposed to be used for skylight, painting and glazing, piling, etc.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles then had estimates made of the probable cost of the items which Mr. Ehrhart wanted to omit, with the following result: Translucent material, $3,172.97; roofing, $1,100; painting and glazing, $1,400; piling, $1,300; total, $6,792.97.  Mr. Ehrhart's
                            
                            <pb n="41" xml:id="TMISB03-041"/>
                            
                            estimate of the cost of these items was $1,000 more than that quoted, making his total bid for the building complete without the staff, $36,541.97, or $2,898.03 below the bid of Goldie &amp; Sons.</p>
                            <p>These facts and figures were discussed in detail by the executive committee, and it was finally decided that the course taken by the Congress Construction company indicated that the execution of a contract with that concern for this building would probably result in endless trouble, as it was evident from attendant circumstances that the attitude taken was merely a subterfuge.  The action of the committee in awarding the contract to this company was therefore reconsidered, the disposition of the check being left to the president.</p>
                            <p>This left the contract in the air, and a discussion then ensued on awarding the job to either Goldie &amp; Sons of Chicago or Parrish of Omaha.  Goldie was lower than Parrish, if the piling was given to him, but higher by $266 if the exposition did the piling.  A strong argument in Goldie's favor, however, was the fact that he asked only eighty days in which to complete the building, whereas Parrish wanted 150 days, or five months.  This point proved a winner, as the strong sentiment of the committee was to the effect that the buildings must be rushed to counteract the impression that little is being done.  It was decided that it would delay matters very materially for the exposition to attempt to do the piling, and these two facts taken together outweighed the strong sentiment in favor of awarding the contract to an Omaha man.  The contract was then awarded to Goldie &amp; Sons, thus giving the firm the two largest buildings on the grounds, viz.: The Mines and Mining and the Agriculture buildings.  The contract on the former requires it to be completed within ninety days from the execution of the contract and the latter building is to be completed within eighty days.  Mr. Goldie stated yesterday that he would have his material for the Agriculture building ordered within twenty-four hours after he received his contract.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Buildings and Grounds was authorized to have photographs made of the buildings as the construction progresses to form a part of the records, the pictures to be taken at intervals of about one week.</p>
                            <p>On recommendation of Manager Reed of the Department of Concessions the concession for the check stand privileges was let to William I. Kierstead of this city.</p>
                            <p>A letter from the secretary of the Nebraska Electrical Medical society announced that the society had appointed a committee consisting of Drs. J. M. Keys, W. S.

                            <p>The contract for the carpenter work on the Liberal Arts building was let last night to Wallace H. Parrish of Omaha and he agrees to complete the frame work of the building, ready for the staff workers, within ninety days from the execution of his contract.  This makes six of the main buildings of the exposition on which contracts have now been let, viz.: Administration, Manufactures, Mines and Mining, Machinery and Electricity, Agriculture, Liberal Arts.  All of these buildings are under contract to be completed, including the staff and finishing, before February 1, next year.  This covers all of the large buildings, the ones yet remaining being smaller in size and requiring less time for their construction.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee held a special meeting at the office of the Department of Buildings and Grounds last night to open bids for the Liberal Arts building and award the contract.  Ten bids were received for the carpenter work and two for doing the staff work.  The carpentry bids in detail were as follows:</p>
                            <p>R. A. Estell, Omaha, $22,625.65; deduct for piling if done by the exposition, $1,000; deduct if corner pavilion is omitted, $100; time, sixty days.</p>

                            <p>After the bids were opened the committee decided that the gallery in this building should be omitted and this decision made Parrish the lowest bidder, his figures for the gallery without the building being $16,966.

                            <p>No action was taken on the bids for the staff and plaster work, as there was no great haste about this matter.  Nelson's bid is the lowest, but this same firm was also lowest on the Agriculture building but have not responded to a notice to appear at once and enter into a contract for the Agriculture building.</p>

                            <p>A report has been current that Mr. Goldie intended to bring a large force of carpenters and other workmen from Chicago to work on this building.  Mr. Goldie was questioned yesterday regarding this report and he denied most emphatically that it was true.</p>

"Those will be our foremen, who have been in our employ for years, but the workingmen and carpenters who will be employed to do the work will be employed right on the grounds.  We will not bring any men from Chicago other than those I have specified, but we will put a large force of men at work just as soon as possible and the work will be pushed at a rate which may surprise some of the Omaha people who are not acquainted with the manner in which these big exposition buildings are erected.  We have the largest buildings on the grounds and we do not propose to let any grass grow under our feet. We will put our own mill machinery in the Mines building just as soon as the floor is ready for it and from that moment the wood will fly."</p>

                            <p>The people of the Black Hills are holding frequent meetings for arranging for the exhibit which the Hills district is to make at the exposition.  A Deadwood paper on Thursday contains three columns of an account of a meeting held in the court house at Deadwood Wednesday of this week, at which representatives were present from nearly all of the counties in the Black Hills district.  The plans of the exhibits were discussed and the various representatives indicated the general nature of the exhibits which will be made their respective districts.  The famous Wind Cave of the Hot Springs district will probably be reproduced on a small scale, and models of famous mines in the hills will be on every hand, together with models of smelters, stamp mills, etc.  One general plan which was generally favored consisted of a stone wall surrounding the entire exhibit space, the wall to be constructed of the various kids of building and ornamental stone to be found in the hills, including onyx, quartz, pyritic ore, galena ore, copper ore, etc.  Inside this wall will be installed the exhibit of grain, grasses and other resources of the hills.</p>
                            <p>It was the general sentiment of the meeting that no stone should be left unturned to make the mineral exhibit the finest of that made by any section of the country, and many suggestions were made regarding it.  It was decided to apply for 6,000 square feet of space as a beginning, although it was conceded that this would not be enough and fully <choice><sic>10,0000</sic><corr>10,000</corr></choice> feet would be required.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Visits to the Nashville and St. Louis Expositions Result in the Selection of Many Good Exhibits.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The display of art at the Transmississippi Exposition is beginning to take form and the indications favor a collection of works of art which will reflect credit upon the west from an artistic standpoint.  The collecting of the articles which are to be housed in the Art building of the exposition has been turned over by the Department of Exhibits to a committee of the Western Art association, of which committee Paul Charlton is the chairman.  This committee is assisted by A. H. Griffiths, who has been appointed art director for the exposition.  Mr. Griffiths is at present director of the Art museum of Detroit and has a national reputation as an art director, although he lays no claim to ability as an artist.</p>
                            <p>Messrs. Charlton and Griffiths visited the expositions in Nashville and St. Louis during the last two weeks to make selections from the large number of paintings and other works of art on exhibition at those points.  Since his return from this trip Mr. Charlton expresses the greatest confidence in the magnitude and character of the art display.  He says most positively that the aim of the art committee and the art director will be to secure a collection of works of art which shall be noted for its excellence and that no attempt will be made to gather a large collection of pictures and other works of art of mediocre <choice><sic>qualiay</sic><corr>quality</corr></choice>.  On the contrary, Mr. Charlton says every picture or statue will be rigidly scrutinized on its artistic merit and the governing idea will be quality instead of quantity.</p>
                            <p>Regarding the pictures secured at Nashville and St. Louis Mr. Charlton said he and Mr. Griffiths had selected about fifty of the best pictures in the 1,200 on exhibition at Nashville and about the same number from among the 600 at the St. Louis exposition.  The St. Louis collection, Mr. Charlton said, was especially good, Mr. Kurtz, a well known artist, having spent several months abroad in collecting them from among the best works of ancient and modern painters.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ART FROM ST. LOUIS MUSEUM.</head>
                            <p>In addition to securing these paintings, Messrs. Charlton and Griffiths also induced the authorities of the St. Louis museum to agree to loan the Transmississippi Exposition a number of replica of Pompeiian bronzes, as well as statuary and pictures belonging to the museum.  Mr. Charlton stated, in this connection, that other museums would be requested to loan some of their treasures for the art display of the exposition.  He mentioned especially a Reubens and a Murillo belonging to the Detroit museum, each of which is valued at $30,000, and a piece of Japanese carving called the "Giant Wrestlers," belonging to the same museum, which is the largest piece of Japanese carving in this country.  He also said that the museums of Chicago, Cincinnati and Pittsburg will be requested to loan some of their desirable pieces.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Griffiths submitted a written report to the Department of Exhibits regarding his visit to St. Louis and Nashville with Mr. Charlton.  He laid particular stress upon the point referred to by Mr. Charlton, that quality, rather than quantity, should govern the art display.  He referred in detail to the pictures which had been secured for the exposition and enclosed a list of them, which is given herewith:</p>

                            <head type="sub">PICTURES MUST BE EXHIBITED.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Griffiths states that in order to make sure of these meritorious pictures it will be necessary to take charge of them and expose them to the public view in some of the large eastern cities, and, he says, that he has made arrangements, on his own account, to have this done as the artists would not consent to having their pictures stored in some warehouse from the close of the expositions at which they are now displayed until the opening of the Transmississippi Exposition, June 1, 1898.  Under this arrangement contracts are being made with the several artists for the delivery of their pictures in Omaha, April 15, next year.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Griffiths also says that he will secure a large and excellent collection of autotypes of the most celebrated paintings in the world.</p>
                            <p>He will go to Philadelphia and Pittsburg in October to attend the exhibitions of paintings which will be held.  He says that these exhibitions always contain many valuable and desirable paintings for the reason that there is always a ready sale in both cities for works of art.</p>
                            <p>In connection with the collection of the art exhibit the Department of Exhibits is taking steps to select are connoisseurs in each of the principal cities, who will be asked to serve on a committee for each city to pass upon paintings and other works of art which are offered from their vicinity for exhibition at the Transmississippi Exposition.  This is to avoid having undesirable pictures or statuary sent to Omaha when their merits would not warrant their exhibition.  These committees will be clothed with authority to pass upon this class of exhibits and the department will be bound by their action.</p>

                            <head type="sub">LAGOON RESEMBLES A GREAT MIRROR</head>
                            <head type="sub">Water in the Bottom of the Lake on the Exposition Grounds Reflects the Buildings of the Main Court.</head>
                            <p>Visitors to the exposition grounds who are not too pessimistic to see good in anything may now form a faint conception of the general effect which will be obtained in the main court be means of the lagoon.  The planking about the lagoon has been nearly completed and water has been turned into the excavation.  In addition to the water flowing from the artesian well, a two-inch pipe has been laid from the mains of the Omaha Water company and the water from this also flows into the lagoon.  This latter pipe is simply temporary and was laid for furnishing water during construction, but the water from it is used to assist in filling the lagoon and the effect is very noticeable.  The west end of the lagoon, the broad, three-lobed basin which has been named "The Mirror," is now a sheet of glassy water which reflects everything in that vicinity.  The water extends in narrow channels for some distance past the bridge at Twentieth street, and the tall form of the Administration building is reflected from these narrow ribbons water in a way which gives a faint impression of the effect which will be produced when the lagoon is filled with water of crystal clearness and the stately forms of the palatial structures surrounding the canal are reflected from the placid surface.</p>
                            <p>The bottom of the lagoon seems to hold the water in a satisfactory manner, but the efficacy of the sheet piling as a stop to leakage laterally remains to be tested.  This piling will be completed very soon and the water will be allowed to run into the lagoon until it acquires the requisite depth, unless the piling fails to hold it.</p>
                            <p>Grading for the Auditorium and Power buildings was commenced this morning.  These two buildings will be on the Kountze tract, the Auditorium at the southeast corner, near Sherman avenue, and the Power building at the northeast corner, occupying a corresponding position.  A small amount of grading will be necessary to prepare the sites for these buildings, it being necessary to remove a small portion of the approach to the viaduct over Sherman avenue.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Contract for Supplying Material for State Building to Be Awarded.</head>
                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission will meet tonight for the transaction of general business.  The special committee appointed at the last meeting to report upon the division of the state funds so as to secure the best results will probably report.  Until action is taken on the matter referred to this committee, the several state societies and others who have applied to the state board for assistance in making exhibits will not know "where they are at."</p>
                            <p>Bids for supplying the material for the erection of the State building will also be opened and a contract will probably be awarded for the lumber and other material necessary for its construction.  Superintendent Blake has already let the contract for supplying the piles necessary for the foundation and for driving them.  The former contract was led to P. A. Gavin of Omaha and the work of driving the piles was awarded to an Omaha man named Welsh, a practical piledriver.</p>
                            <p>This week the headquarters of the commission will be on the State fair grounds in the Horticultural building.  Assistant Secretary Dearing has removed his office to the fair grounds and will make that his headquarters during the week.  The members of the commission expect to spend the greater part of their time during the week on the grounds looking after the interests of the Nebraska portion of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>The Chase Pump &amp; Manufacturing company of the Columbus, O., has applied for 400 feet of space for an exhibit of pumps, etc.</p>
                            <p>W. L. Clark of Santa Barbara, Cal., has applied for 100 square feet of space for an exhibit of Indian, Mexican and California curios.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds has returned from an extended eastern trip, and all the members of the executive committee are now in the city for the first time in several months.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Publicity and Promotion has opened headquarters in the Horticure building on the State fair grounds and visitors to the fair are supplied with literature and information regarding the exposition which is to open in Omaha, June 1, 1898.</p>
                            <p>Kern county, California, is making preparations to give the other California counties a close race in the way of an exhibit, and it has opened up negotiations with the Department of Exhibits regarding a space of 1,000 square feet for a country exhibit of fruits and other products.</p>
                            <p>General Agent Phillippi of the Missouri Pacific Railway company notified the Department of Buildings and Grounds this morning that his road was ready to proceed at once with laying the tracks on the exposition grounds in accordance with the contract recently entered into.  He says the material is all on the grounds and that track laying will be commenced at once.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Hundreds of Men Are Soon to Be Employed in the Erection of Structures that Are to Comprise the White City.</head>
                            <p>A friendly rivalry has been instituted between the contractors for the main buildings on the exposition grounds and a hot race is now on to see who will first complete one of the large buildings.  The race promises to be between the big Mines building and the Liberal Arts building.  Goldie &amp; Sons of Chicago have the contract for the former and Wallace H. Parrish of Omaha has the latter building.  The Chicago firm has thirty days' start of the Omaha man, but this is counterbalanced by the difference in the size of the buildings.  The Mines building is to be 140x400 feet, while the Liberal Arts building will be 130x240.  Each contractor wagers that he will have the first completed building on the grounds, barring the Administration building, which will be finished within the next thirty days.</p>
                            <p>The pile foundation for the Mines building is finished and the work of putting on the frame work and joists for the floor was commenced this morning.  All of the material for this building has been ordered and nearly all of it is either on the ground or on the railroad track, awaiting the completion of railway connections with the grounds.  The contract for the Liberal Arts building was executed last night and the number has been ordered.  Mr. Parrish says he will have the building completed within less than sixty days from today.  Mr. Goldie says the Mines building will be ready for the staff workers by the middle of November.</p>
                            <p>In this contest of speed in construction, the Manufactures and Machinery buildings may prove to be dark horses, especially the former.  Contractor Strehlow, who has the contract for the Manufactures building, has been seriously hampered by the slowness with which the lumber firm has delivered his material.  He has his sills all in place, but cannot go ahead with the superstructure because he has not yet received his long timbers for post.  He has the large entrance dome well along, however, and will be in position to make good time whenever his delayed material arrives.  Much of his archwork and other prepared timber is ready to be put in place and a large force of men could be employed to advantage as soon as the material arrives.</p>
                            <p>Hamilton Brothers expect to commence work on the Machinery building within the next ten days.  The contract for the pile foundation has been let and the material for the superstructure is on the way.</p>
                            <p>When the work on these buildings is well under way there will be fully 700 carpenters employed on them, besides a large number of laborers and helpers.  Goldie &amp; Sons will employ 300 carpenters on the Mines and Agriculture buildings and there will be from 100 to 150 carpenters employed on each of the other three big buildings in addition to a large number of laborers to handle the heavy timbers.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Executive Committee of Exposition Association Holds a Meeting.</head>
                            <p>The Council Bluffs Transmississippi Exposition association executive committee held an adjourned meeting yesterday evening and Secretary Judson of the committee of officers on incorporation, reported that the question had been talked up and had met with general favor, but on account of other business the committee had been unable to hold a meeting and take any definite action in the matter.  The committee was given further time.</p>
                            <p>Prof Sawyer referred to a previous resolution of the association ordering a circular printed setting forth the advantages of Council Bluffs as a convention city, and stated that the work had not been done.  He offered a motion ordering 1,000 of the circulars to be printed today to be sent to C. H. Warren, who is now in Columbus, O., attending the national convention of the Union Veteran Legion.  The circulars are to be distributed through the convention for the purpose of securing the convention for Council Bluffs in 1898.  This convention would bring in several thousand people to Council Bluffs, and with the aid of the circulars it is thought the convention can be brought here.  Some objection was raised as to the advisability of incurring any more expense until after the corporation had been formed, but on vote it was decided to have the circulars printed and sent, provided the work could be done today.</p>
                            <p>H. W. Binder of the committee on location submitted a number of rooms for consideration and recommended the renting of the room now occupied by Mr. Minnick in the south end of the Grand hotel, which can be procured for six months at $15 per month.  On motion the report was accepted, the association concurring in the recommendation, which was left for further action.  The association adjourned to Thursday evening, September 30.</p>

                            <p>Illinois will have a building on the exposition grounds which will cost in the neighborhood of $20,000.  The exposition commission appointed by Governor Tanner has decided to expend this much of the $45,000 of the state appropriation for its erection.  The commission will visit Omaha in the near future to decide upon the location of the building and arrange other details in that connection.</p>
                            <p>Chairman William H. Harper of the Illinois commission has written a letter to President Wattles containing the information of the action of the commission and asks the president to name a date when it will be convenient and desirable for the Illinois commission to come to Omaha and meet with the exposition management for conference regarding this state building.  Mr. Harper also asks for advertising matter of all kinds with which to boom the exposition among the manufacturers and prospective exhibitors in Illinois.</p>

                            <p>The fund for the erection of the Girls' and Boys' building on the exposition grounds is beginning to grow and the outlook for raising the entire $5,000 required for the building is most promising.  This matter formed one of the main topics of discussion at the meeting of the executive committee of the Women's Board yesterday and it was agreed that the building is assured.  Vice President Kimball has taken an active part in all matters in connection with this building and she reported to the committee that she had started a list of stock subscriptions for the building.  Four subscribers for $100 each had been secured in a short time and she said she felt confident that others would be secured at once.  The four $100 subscribers were Thomas L. Kimball, Herman Kountze, J. M. Woolworth and Mrs. John A. Horbach.  Other subscriptions to the building had been secured from the following parties in various amounts: J. R. Buchanan, J. W. Munn, A. C. Millard, Thomas Kilpatrick, Dora Cady, Harriet S. Heller, Alice Towne, J. A. Wakefield, A. H. Snyder, Ida V. Tilden, Arthur B. Smith, E. E. Bruce, Mrs. L. C. Cory of Lincoln, Walter and Emil Haubens.</p>
                            <p>The following committee of members of the Woman's Board was appointed to take charge of the collection of subscriptions for the Girls' and Boys' building: Mesdames T. L. Kimball, Omaha; Giffert, West Point; Munroe, South Omaha; Keys, Council Bluffs, and Cudahy, Omaha.</p>

                            <p>October 8 has been designated as Nebraska Day at the Tennessee Centennial exposition and arrangements are being made to have as large a delegation as possible go from Nebraska to Nashville on that occasion.  President Wattles is endeavoring to organize a large delegation of Nebraska people in order that the proper appreciation may be shown of the interest of Nebraska people in the doings of other sections of the country.  An effort is being made to secure special rates and there is every prospect that no difficulty will be encountered in this direction.  Governor Holcomb and his official staff will be of the party and it is expected that they will be accompanied by W. J. Bryan.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE AT EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Classic in Style, the Home of the United States Exhibit Promises to Be One of the Most Attractive on the Grounds.</head>
                            <p>The following is the official description of the building to be erected on the Transmississippi Exposition grounds by the federal government, the description being given out from the office of the supervising architect of the Treasury department at Washington:</p>
                            <p>The building to be erected by the United States government is to be situated at the west end of the grounds at the head of the lake and has the seat of honor of the whole exhibit, facing, as it does, the main group of buildings.  It was designed under the general direction of Charles E. Kemper, acting supervising architect of the Treasury department at Washington, D. C., Edward A. Crane being the draughtsman in immediate charge.</p>
                            <p>The building will be used in the classic style, the Ionic order being used.  It is to be arranged in three sections, that at the immediate center having a frontage on the lake of 208 feet and a height to top of balustrade over cornice of fifty-eight feet.  It will have a depth of 150 feet.  The main entrance facing the center of the lake will be reached by a broad flight of steps and through a colonnade.  This entrance along with the entire center section of the building will be very richly treated in color.  The entrance is flanked on each side by pavilions capped by richly decorated domes.  The main building will be surrounded by a colossal dome, which will tower far above all other buildings on the grounds and will be a landmark for miles around.  This dome will be capped with a heroic figure representing "Liberty Enlightening the World," and at night this figure will be lighted by electricity, and as the torch will be 178 feet above the ground, the beautiful <choice><sic>effeet</sic><corr>effect</corr></choice> can be easily judged.  The side sections, which are separated from the center portion of the building by colonnades connecting with the Agricultural building on one side and the theater on the other, each having a frontage of 148 feet and are 100 feet deep and have a height of forty-four feet to top of balustrade.  This makes the total length of building 504 feet, and height at highest point 178 feet, and the floor space devoted to exhibits will approximate 50,000 square feet.</p>
                            <p>The building will be constructed out of wood and covered with staff on the outside.</p>

                            <p>The list of states outside of the transmississippi territory which are to make state exhibits at the Transmississippi and International Exposition has been increased by the addition of Tennessee.  The state which is now having an exposition of its own will be represented in the great exposition of the western section of the union by a display of its resources.</p>
                            <p>As an evidence that an exhibit of the resources of Tennessee will be made at Omaha, an application for 3,000 feet of space for an exhibit of the agricultural, horticultural and the many other resources of the state has been lodged with Prof. F. W. Taylor of the Bureau of Agriculture, Horticulture, Forestry and Irrigation, who has been in Nashville in attendance at the exposition.  This information was telegraphed this morning by Prof Taylor, who stated that the application was made by the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway company, which will make an extensive display.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Transportation is almost daily in receipt of circulars from the various freight associations of the country announcing special rates on goods intended for exhibition at the exposition.  The latest of these is an announcement from the Chicago and Ohio River Freight association making a rate of full tariff on goods going to the exposition, with free transportation returning.</p>
                            <p>A telegram from Prof. F. W. Taylor to the Department of Exhibits makes the announcement that the Forestry convention which just adjourned its annual session at Nashville left the selection of the place for the next meeting to a committee.  The telegram also states that a majority of this committee is already pledged to choose Omaha for the next meeting, so that this convention is assured.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Citizens Petition County Commissioners to Submit a Proposition at November Election&#8212;Matter to Be Disposed of This Afternoon.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The petition to the Board of County Commissioners asking that a proposition for a bond issue of $100,000 in aid of the Transmississippi and International Exposition be submitted to a vote of the people of Douglas county at the coming election was laid <choice><sic>befor</sic><corr>before</corr></choice> the board at its regular meeting this morning.  The petition contained the signatures of 1,391 voters of this county.</p>
                            <p>The exposition was represented by President Wattles and Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion.</p>
                            <p>The petition was read and the whole matter was then referred to the committee of the whole, it being agreed that the committee and representatives of the exposition should meet this afternoon and thoroughly discuss the matter.</p>
                            <p>The law requires that any bond proposition must be publicly advertised at least thirty days before the election at which it is to be submitted, and prompt action was deemed necessary for the reason that the next election occurs November 2, and the thirty days will begin to run the latter part of next week.</p>
                            <p>The commissioners adopted a resolution introduced by Chairman Stenberg, dividing South Omaha into four election precincts, to <choice><sic>corespond</sic><corr>correspond</corr></choice> to the four wards into which the city was divided in 1887 by ordinance, soon after the passage of the South Omaha charter.  This resolution was accompanied by an opinion of the county attorney, to the effect that under the existing laws election districts in cities of the second class must conform to the ward lines inside the city limits and that the custom which has obtained in the past, of considering South Omaha as one big election district, having one assessor, was wrong, and should be changed to comply with the law.</p>
                            <p>The effect of the change will be to require each ward in South Omaha to have an assessor, instead of having one assessor for the entire city, as has been the custom.  It is also probable that it will be necessary to elect a justice of the peace and two constables in each ward of the city.</p>
                            <p>When the resolution was read Commissioner Hoctor asked if it was necessary that any action along this line be taken by the board.  He said some of the wards in South Omaha were small and had but few voters and these were dominated by a certain power which would make the work of assessment a farce.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Stenberg said it was absolutely necessary that the law be complied with since the discovery had been made that such was the law.</p>
                            <p>After some discussion between Mr. Hoctor and the chairman on the merits of the new departure the resolution was adopted.</p>

                            <p>All indications point to a recognition of the Transmississippi and International Exposition by the railroads of the United States on the same basis recognition was accorded to the great Columbian exposition.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Transportation has opened correspondence with all the transportation lines, both land and water, which traverse this country or touch at its ports.  These companies have been asked to extend to the Transmississippi Exposition the same courtesies given the World's fair in the way of special freight rates.  Such replies as have been received warrant the assertion that the same rates will be made on exposition goods to Omaha and return as were made to and from Chicago during the World's fair.</p>
                            <p>In accordance with the request of the Department of Transportation the Southwestern Freight association announces a rate of full tariff charges on all exhibits from the point of shipment to Omaha, with free return to point of shipment, provided the goods have not changed owners in the meantime.  This is the same rate that was made for the World's fair.  The Southwestern Freight association includes in its membership all of the main lines of railway in the southwest territory.</p>
                            <p>Other freight traffic associations have not held a meeting since the Department of Transportation sent out its request for special rates for the exposition, but it is the opinion of those familiar with such matters that the other freight associations in the country will follow the lead of the Southwestern association and put in the same rate.</p>
                            <p>The department has also received a letter from the general freight agent of the Texas &amp; Pacific railway stating that his road would not only make a rate of full tariff charge one way with free return when the goods do not change hands, but would also act as agent for foreign exhibitors shipping goods in bond over that road by seeing goods through the customs house at New Orleans and landing them in the bonded warehouse at Omaha without making <choice><sic>an</sic><corr>a</corr></choice> charge for these services.</p>

                            <p>The Board of County commissioners, sitting as a committee of the whole, met with representatives of the Transmississippi and International Exposition yesterday afternoon to confer regarding the petition which had been submitted to the commissioners, asking that a question be submitted to the vote of the people for the issuance of county bonds in the sum of $100,000.  It was decided that the proposition should be submitted at the coming election, but the exact form of the question to be submitted to vote of the people was not agreed upon, an adjournment being taken until Monday morning at 10.30 o'clock for further consideration of this matter.</p>
                            <p>The exposition was represented by President Wattles, Chairman Lindsey, Managers Rosewater and Reed and Director Wharton.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Ostrom was made chairman of the meeting of the committee.  The petition asking for the submission of the bond proposition was read and upon motion of Commissioner Stenberg was referred to a committee of two to examine the signatures and report whether the necessary number of signatures (1,000) appeared to the petition.  The chair appointed as this committee Commissioners Stenberg and Hoctor.</p>
                            <p>After examining the document this committee reported that it found there were 1,391 signatures; it was also reported that very few duplications of signatures had been found, thereby making it certain that the required number had been secured.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Stenberg then moved that it be the sense of the board that a proposition be submitted to the voters of Douglas county at the coming election providing for the issuance of the bonds of the county in the sum of $100,000, running twenty years, and bearing interest at the rate of 4½ per cent, payable semi-annually.</p>
                            <p>This motion was adopted unanimously after some discussion on the part of Commissioner Hoctor, who thought the bonds would sell well at 4 per cent interest, but it was the sense of the other members that the time was so short within which the money would be needed, if voted, that it would be unwise to run the risk of having to advertise the bonds several times before disposing of them on account of the sharp demand for money.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Kierstead said it was most important that the bond proposition should be constructed in such a way as to inspire confidence on the part of the people in the disposition of the money in order that the proposition might be carried.  He submitted a form of proposition which had been prepared by C. S. Montgomery, corporation counsel for the exposition.  This was taken up by the board and gone over very carefully and deliberately, paragraph by paragraph, the county attorney and Mr. Wharton taking part in the consideration of this important document.</p>
                            <p>Before the proposition had been entirely formulated the meeting adjourned until Monday morning, when the proposition will be completed and finally acted upon at the meeting of the board Tuesday morning.</p>

                            <head type="sub">$1,341.11 for Labor on Grounds, and $4,910.23 for Management--Some More of Geraldine's "Monkey Work" Exposed.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>When it was proposed to hold a Transmississippi exposition at Omaha in 1898 THE WESTERN LABORER was in favor of it, because we thought it would revive business and give employment to the unemployed of this city and vicinity.  When we say the "unemployed" we mean the laborer and mechanic who would be employed on the work, and who would change their wages in our stores for commodities, thus improving business and keeping the money subscribed and appropriated by the state and United States government circulating in our midst.</p>
                            <p>Under this head will be found the proofs of how well the "management" have kept the people's trust and how their money is being spent, and for whose benefit.</p>
                            <p>It is said that figures don't lie, therefore we have no comment to make upon the monthly report of wages&#8212;and "salaries" paid for the month of August.  We merely ask the stock subscribers to read the hair-raising and paralyzing facts as they are presented in the official report.  That will be enough.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Geraldine suspects there is a "leak" in the employes on the grounds and a number of the "suspects" were "laid off" this week, but Dion can never plug his "leaks" so tight that THE WESTERN LABORER cannot tap them.</p>
                            <p>Joe Schwartz, Geraldine's Indian and lackey, discharged Victor Kelner, a rodman, last week.</p>
                            <p>On Monday fourteen men were fired but Mr. Dailey, who finished the sewer contract let by Geraldine without contract or specifications, was on that day sweeping up chips on the bottom of the lagoon at $5 per day.</p>
                            <p>By the way there is something funny about the planking of the sides of this lagoon.  The contract was "let" to Creedon &amp; Mahoney for $5,936.50.  This sum looks quite generous for "labor and nails," seeing that the exposition company did the piling and furnish the planking for the face of the lagoon.  Three men puts on, on the average, 116 feet of plank per day&#8212;one man receives $2 a day, the other two $1.50, and one man assured us that he would like to take this $5,936.50 job for about $1,500.  It will thus be seen that Creedon &amp; Mahoney make about $100 a day on this job.  But perhaps they have to divide with the Great Divider.</p>
                            <p>Joe Schwartz, Geraldine's Indian, is down as a "rodman" on the time book.  He received 26 days' pay up to Sept. 1, but only carried a rod one day in August, and the rest of the time did nothing.  When asked what his employment is, he replies, "My work is not commenced until the high buildings are up.  I am a 'high decorator'&#8212;put up flags, etc," but if his work is 
                                
                                <pb n="48" xml:id="TMISB03-048"/>
                                
                                not yet ready he continues to draw a salary regularly.  This fellow has been Geraldine's lackey for eight years, and the latter always keeps him on the (somebody else's) pay roll.</p>
                            <p>W. H. Tamm, superintendent at $4 per day, is the fellow whom Geraldine imported and put to work against the wish of the executive committee.  He was dubbing around on the lagoon "job," but was removed for incompetency.  He was then put on the administration building where the men engaged on it do as they please, knowing that the "superintendent" knows as much about the building as it does about him.</p>
                            <p>We are creditably informed that Templeton and Geraldine "are in" on the pile driving.  A competent authority informs us that the piles can be driven for four cents a foot.  Now, watch what this pile driving is going to cost the exposition company.</p>
                            <p>John F. Dailey was put on the lagoon as inspector or superintendent at $5 a day, and has nothing to do but sweep up chips, as above referred to.  When the sewer laying job was to be handed out it was in the pictures that Dailey was to get the hand-out.  It was discovered that the executive board had adopted a rule that no man could bid for contracts who was on the exposition pay roll.  Dailey was on the pay
                                
                                <pb n="46"/> <!-- xml:id="TMISB03-046" -->
                                
                                roll, but a little thing like that didn't worry Geraldine.  He took daily off the pay roll, ad then instructed him to build the sewer.  Dailey built the sewer, and now he is back on the pay roll again.  Do you see the point?</p>
                            <p>If our readers, the subscribers to stock and the Omaha business men will look at the wages and "salaries" paid for the month of August they will find how much the unemployed and business people have profited by the exposition enterprise so far.</p>
                            <p>Salaries and wages for August:</p>
                            <p>For labor wages on grounds and salaries in Paxton block, $6,251.34.</p>
                            <p>For labor on grounds, $1,341.11.</p>
                            <p>Salaries for management, $4,910.23.</p>
                            <p>How do the workingmen and business men like this presentment?</p>
                            <p>Should the directors not blush with shame at being parties to such rascality?  Is it any wonder that THE WESTERN LABORER says that if the management were honest men and not knaves they would fire Geraldine and his fellow grafters in short order?</p>

                            <head type="sub">Douglas County Voters to Have an Opportunity of Recording Themselves in Favor of the Great Show.</head>
                            <p>The Board of County Commissioners met in committee of the whole this morning to continue the consideration of the resolution which provides for the submission at the coming election of a proposition to vote $100,000 in bonds to enable the county to participate in the exposition.  Commissioner Ostrom presided and the resolution was adopted by the committee after fully two hours of discussion.  The board will meet in regular session tomorrow to adopt the resolution as unanimously recommended by the committee of the whole.</p>
                            <p>The preamble of the resolution quotes the petition recently submitted by more than 1,000 voters and the fact that a government and state appropriation of more than $200,000 has been made, as required by the law.  It then provides for an issue of 4½ per cent twenty-year bonds, "to provide for the expenses of promoting the interests of said Interstate Exposition and by making at such exposition a county exhibit, and to improve and beautify the exposition grounds, and for the purpose of erecting or aiding in the erection of a suitable building therefor, and for maintaining the same during such exposition."</p>
                            <p>The resolution provides that a copy of the notice shall be published in The Omaha Evening Bee, the official paper of the county, for four weeks previous to the election.</p>
                            <p>The notice of the bond election, which is also included in the resolution, provides that the bonds shall be dated January 1, 1898, and that the interest shall be payable on January 1 and July 1 of each year.  The amount necessary to be raised by taxation each year for the payment of the interest on the bonds is fixed at $4,500 and for the creation of a sinking fund with which to pay off the principal, $5,000 a year.</p>
                            <p>The discussion was mainly on the details of the resolution with a view to securing absolute accuracy from a legal standpoint.  Commissioner Hoctor wanted a clause inserted that would definitely state the manner in which the money was to be expended, but it was suggested that this point was sufficiently covered in the law under which the proposition is to be submitted.  The question whether the bond proposition should be placed on a separate ballot or added to the county ticket was also raised, but was left for future consideration.</p>

The letter of Lord Salisbury is somewhat lengthy and, after stating the decision of the government to not participate in the exposition officially, conveys the information that the Board of Trade, which is a government institution, will render any assistance in its power to private individuals or committees formed for the purpose of promoting the objects of the exposition.  The letter also states that the Board of Trade will be pleased to distribute circulars and other matter relating to the exposition among Chambers of Commerce or other organizations interested in the matter, and to give publicity to such documents through the medium of the official publication, the Journal Tariff and Trade Notices.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles is also in receipt of another communication from the State department, enclosing a copy of a note from the minister of foreign affairs for the Netherlands, conveying the information that the government had decided, after due deliberation, to refrain from sending an official representative to the Transmississippi Exposition, but stating, further, that the government is quite prepared to do all in its power to disseminate information regarding the exposition and afford any assistance in its power to intending exhibitors.</p>

                            <p>Bureau of Agriculture, Horticulture, Forestry and Irrigation of the Department of Exhibits of the exposition, has returned from the Nashville exposition, where he went to secure a number of conventions to meet next year in Omaha.  He stated this morning that one of the things that struck him most forcibly while there was the familiarity of the people of Nashville with the conditions in connection with the Transmississippi Exposition.  "They know we are going to have an exposition next year," said Prof. Taylor, "and they know all about it.  I had dozens of people to say to me that if their exposition had been as well advertised as the Transmississippi Exposition is being exploited all over the country they would be having a much larger attendance.  They say that the Transmississippi Exposition is better known now than theirs was at the time the gates were opened.</p>
                            <p>"Nashville is making great preparations for Nebraska day," continued the professor.  "They say they are going to give Nebraskans a sample of southern hospitality on that occasion and I should judge from all indications I saw that the whole country will be dyed a bright scarlet.  Major Thomas, president of the exposition, told me that they were making extensive preparations to have Nebraska day one of the red letter days of the entire exposition.</p>
                            <p>"One of the principal things which attracted my attention in connection with the agricultural part of the Nashville exposition," remarked Prof. Taylor, "was the quality of the exhibits made by the various railroads.  There were five roads having exhibits of the agricultural and mining products along their lines.  These were arranged in an attractive way and each road must have expended at least $5,000 in making its display.  The Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis road was the only one of the five having headquarters in Nashville, and I secured an application for 3,000 feet of space for a display to be made by this road.  I expect to secure similar applications from the other roads, and if I succeed, Tennessee will be well represented."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Work Had Reached that Point Where Results Were Not Readily Apparent, but Construction Will Soon Be Booming.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The impression is current in certain quarters that the work of constructing the buildings and grounds of the Transmississippi and International Exposition is not proceeding as rapidly as it should.  People who hold to this impression point to the fact that but little progress seems to be making on the grounds and they argue from this premise that the whole matter is dragging along and that very little is being done.</p>
                            <p>Plausible as this argument may seem it is erroneous.  While it is true that, to the naked eye, the work seems to drag, yet this is not the case.  This apparent paradox is explained by the fact that the whole work is just at that stage where it is passing out of the chrysalis state into brilliant and forceful life.  The apparent inactivity has really been a condition of inward exertion which has wrought marvelously and this will be apparent to every observer within a short time.</p>
                            <p>The whole situation as it now exists may be stated in a very few words, but they mean much: The supervising architects were appointed in March of this year.  In the short period of less than seven months the arrangement of the ground has been decided upon, the grading has all been completed, the lagoon has been finished and is now being filled with water, the plans for all of the buildings on the main court have been completed and all save the Art building are under contract with bonds which guarantee the completion of all of them by February 1 next year.  The magnitude of the work represented in this single sentence may not be grasped all at once, but Architect Dwight Perkins of Chicago, the architect for the Machinery and Electricity building, who was officially connected with the World's fair, is authority for the statement that as much has been accomplished on the Transmississippi Exposition in seven months as was accomplished on the World's fair in two years.  Mr. Perkins explained that the preliminary work of arranging the general disposition of the site and deciding upon the location of the buildings usually consumes several months; then the preparing of the ground, especially where any waterways are to be constructed, consumes several more months, after which the finishing of the building plans uses up a few more months, and thus the time slips away.  This method has been avoided in the case of the Transmississippi Exposition and all of the preliminaries have been disposed of without loss of time.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GRADING PRACTICALLY COMPLETED.</head>
                            <p>The grading of the entire grounds has been practically completed.  What little remains to be done is insignificant in extent and is in such locations that it will not interfere in any way with the progress of the other work.  The completion of the lagoon was, in itself, a task of no mean proportion, but it is finished and the water is now running into it.  The Omaha Water company has generously offered to donate the water needed to fill the great hole and a special line of pipe will be laid from one of the large mains to the point selected for filling the lake.  Within the next thirty days the lagoon will be filled to the point where it will remain and it will be kept full.  Incidentally, it may be remarked that one of the fine skating rinks in the world will be formed when Jack Frost touches the surface of the water with his icy fingers.</p>
                            <p>The sewers for the entire grounds have been completed.  With the exception of a very small portion of the work, these sewer systems are permanent and the surrounding property owners will derive substantial benefit from this work.  The sewers were designed by the city engineering department and are laid in the alleys where they will be accessible to property owners after the exposition is over.  By this thing alone the property owners in the vicinity of the exposition grounds escape taxation to the extent of about $12,000, as the exposition management pays for the sewers.</p>
                            <p>The pipe for the water system has arrived and Contractor William Fitch has been ordered to commence at once the work of
                            
                            <pb n="50" xml:id="TMISB03-050"/>
                            
                            laying it.  His contract requires him to complete the entire work within forty days from the time he is ordered to proceed.  This means the completion of this work early in November.</p>
                            <p>It will be seen that the work on the ground itself has advanced to a point where the building contractors will not be interfered with in the least by the contractors for the underground work.</p>
                            <p>The conditions relating to the main buildings are fully as favorable as those surrounding the other work.  As has been stated heretofore, all of the buildings surrounding the lagoon are under contract and every one of them will be completed by February 1, next year, ready for the installation of the exhibits.  This latter statement is assured by the fact that the contract for each building places a limit on the time within which the building is to be completed and this provision is supported by a bond for a substantial amount conditioned on the contractor carrying out the terms of his contract and completing the work within the time specified.  These bonds are signed by individuals or corporations whose financial standing has been rigidly investigated and found to be unquestioned.</p>

                            <head type="sub">CONDITION OF BUILDINGS.</head>
                            <p>The following brief statement of the condition of each of the main buildings will throw additional light on this subject:</p>
                            <p>Administration Building&#8212;The carpenter work on this building was let to Briggs &amp; Cushman of Omaha July 8, to be completed within 120 days, or by November 5.  The carpenter work is practically completed, a little finishing up here and there being all that remains to be done.  The staff work was let to the Artistic Stucco &amp; Modeling company of Chicago July 14, the staff and plaster work to be completed within thirty days after the completion of the carpenter work.  The casting of the stucco work has been under way for several weeks and the greater part of the set pieces have been completed.  The work has been going on rapidly on the building itself and an idea may now be obtained of the appearance of the completed building.</p>
                            <p>Manufactures Building&#8212;The contract for the carpenter work on this building was executed with R. C. Strehlow of Omaha July 21, to be completed within ninety days, or by October 19.  Strehlow has been seriously hampered by delay in the receipt of his material, said to be due to the scarcity of cars in which to haul it from the forests.  He is making good headway now, however, and the building is rapidly assuming form.  It is probable that he will overrun his time limit.  The staff and plaster work was awarded to Smith &amp; Eastman of Chicago, to be completed November 4.  Unless delayed by Strehlow, this firm will complete its contract within the time, much of the work being already cast and in shape to put in position.</p>
                            <p>Machinery and Electricity Building&#8212;The carpenter work was let to Hamilton Bros. of Omaha September 4, to be completed within 120 days, or by January 2, next year.  The material has been ordered and is now on the way and the piles are being driven.  The staff and plaster work was let to Smith &amp; Eastman September 15, to be completed within thirty days after the completion of the carpenter work, or by February 2.</p>
                            <p>Mines and Mining Building&#8212;The carpenter work was let to William Coldie &amp; Sons of Chicago, August 12, to be completed within ninety days, or by November 10.  The piles have been driven and cut off.  The work on the building proper has been commenced and the material is all on the ground.  A complete planning mill outfit has been set on the ground ready to be installed in the building as soon as the floor is finished.  The staff work was let to Smith &amp; Eastman August 9, to be completed in 110 days, or by November 27.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">OTHER CONTRACTS AWARDED.</head>
                            <p>Agricultural Building&#8212;The carpenter work was let to William Goldie &amp; Sons September 17, to be finished within seventy days, or by November 26.  The material has been ordered and is on the way.  The staff work has not been awarded.</p>
                            <p>Liberal Arts Building&#8212;The carpenter work was let to Wallace H. Parrish September 20, to be completed in ninety days, or by December 19.  The material has been ordered and is said to be on the way.  Parrish has made a wager that the Liberal Arts building will be the first one of the large buildings to be finished.  The staff work has not been awarded.</p>
                            <p>This completes all of the large main buildings which will face the lagoon and form the chain about the grand court, with the exception of the Art building.  The plans for this will be completed this week and the building will be at once advertised.</p>
                            <p>The Auditorium, which is to be erected at the southeast corner of the main court, with entrances from Sherman avenue and Pinkney street, will will be ready for bidding by the middle of this week.  Fisher &amp; Lawrie of this city are making the plans and have them about completed.</p>
                            <p>The Horticultural building plans have been completed and this building will be placed before the contractors for bids within a short time.</p>
                            <p>This disposes of all of the principal buildings and it will be <unclear/> that all of the delay has been in the <unclear/>ation of the man who thinks that the <unclear/>kind of progress is that which makes a great noise and bluster.  In the opinion of those who speak from experience in exposition matters, the progress has been truly remarkable and the work of erecting the buildings is simply one of the finishing touches which are to be put on.</p>
                            <p>It will be seen by the above resume that all of the buildings will be completed by February 1, and this will give fully ninety days for the installation of the exhibits.  This is regarded as a very wide margin by those familiar with such matters.</p>

                            <p>The officers of the Omaha Street Railway company this morning characterized as absurd the statement given out by the Board of Managers of the State fair.  The figures of admissions appeared to them so irregular that they decided to break their ironclad rule against giving out a statement of the number of passengers hauled.  The following statement given out by the company this morning shows the number of cash fares actually collected each year between the city and the fair grounds.  This does not include any fares of the return trip, or any passes used by persons going to the fair or returning therefrom:</p>

                            </table>
                            <p>This shows an increase in the number of passengers hauled on the street car lines of 2,050 over last year and an increase of 7,820 over the year before.</p>
                            <p>It will be noticed that the total paid admissions, according to Mr. Bassett's statement numbered only 45,676.  The street car company hauled 47,180 passengers to the grounds.  According to the managers' statement the free admissions this year were 13,273, making the total number of admissions 58,948.  As the street cars hauled 47,180 of this number, subtraction leaves but 11,769 persons who used the State fair trains of the Union Pacific and of the Missouri Pacific railroads and those who went to the fair in wagons, carriages, on horseback and on bicycles.</p>
                            <p>The railroad companies at noon stated that they could not yet tell just how many persons they hauled to the State fair.  State fair trains of both the Union and of the Missouri Pacific did a good business throughout the week.  Trains were run about every thirty minutes during Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  The Union Pacific carried big crowds from Omaha, South Omaha and Council Bluffs, especially on Wednesday and Thursday.  The trains varied in length from five to eight cars, and on Wednesday and Thursday they were filled nearly all day.  Railroad men who watched the movement of State fair visitors say that there were many hundreds more people drove to the fair grounds this year than ever before, the number of carriages going out from Omaha to the race course having been very much greater than last year.</p>

                            <p>Officials of the Union Pacific, of the Missouri Pacific and of the Omaha Street Railway were greatly incensed this morning at the reflection of the fair ma<unclear/>rs upon the transportation facilities to and from the fair grounds.  Their excuse for the poor showing made in the statement of admissions was that the transportation facilities were entirely inadequate.  This is strongly resented by the railroad and the street car men and denounced as pure fabrication.  An officer of the Omaha Street Railway company this morning said: "We had a three-minute service to the fair grounds throughout the week.  During the afternoon rush of Wednesday and Thursday more cars were placed in service and were run every two minutes.  It was only for a very short time on Thursday afternoon that the care were overcrowded.  We got over the jam in a very short time, and that was the only time there was any trouble."</p>
                            <p>The Union Pacific and the Missouri Pacific railroads offered better service to the State fair grounds than ever before.  Both railroad companies ran special trains from their respective depots in this city directly to the State fair gates.  In addition, the Union Pacific ran trains from South Omaha and from Council Bluffs.  These trains afforded excellent service, the Union Pacific caring for the travel from the eastern part of the city and from South Omaha and Council Bluffs, and the Missouri Pacific attending to the wants of those who live on the north side of town and along the Belt line encircling the city, making stops at a half dozen different points on the Belt line.  The trains were run every half hour and made the trip in short order, and for the nominal charge of 10 cents.  The train service on neither road was interrupted and in order to prevent crowding as soon as a train was filled another coach would be put on so that all the passengers might find seats.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the attendance report made by the State fair mangers, D. T. Mount of the Omaha Fair and Speed association said: "The figures given out by the officers of the State Board of Agriculture are surprising.  I had nothing to do with the gate receipts and for this reason I am unable to say how many people were on the grounds.  The crowds were enormous, and I supposed that the attendance was the greatest ever seen at any State fair in Nebraska."</p>

                            <p>W. R. Bennett of the Omaha Fair and Speed association said: "There is something wrong somewhere, but where I cannot say.  Everybody knows that the crowds in town last week were the largest seen, and the statement that the attendance at the State fair was less than in 1896 comes like a thunderbolt from a clear sky.  This year the weather was fine and the conditions were perfect, while last year people were hard up and besides there was one rainy day that cut down the attendance very materially.  I don't want to charge any one with stealing, but as I said before, there was something wrong and something that should be investigated."</p>
                            <p>Regarding the methods pursued at the horse gates, Mr. Bennett spoke as follows: "I drove out to the grounds Thursday.  I had tickets for myself and family, and upon reaching the horse gate I was informed by the keeper that I would have to pay for my team.  I started to get out of the wagon for the purpose of going to the box office to buy a ticket, but was informed by the gate keeper that I could give him the money.  I paid this man 50 cents and drove in."</p>
                            <p>C. H. Walworth, residing at Sherman avenue and Burdette street, drove out with his family on Children's day.  The carriage contained himself, his wife and three children, the latter aged 7, 12 and 14 years of age, respectively.  Upon reaching the horse gate the keeper made Mr. Walworth pay 50 cents for his oldest child and $1 for his horse and buggy.  Mr. Walworth told the gate keeper that he would go and buy tickets, but was informed that it was not necessary.  He paid the gate keeper $1.50, and this individual put the money in his pocket without making any note of the payment.</p>
                            <p>County Commissioner Ostrom was in attendance upon the fair two days.  Both days he drove out and both days he paid the keeper on the horse gate.  Mr. Ostrom stated that when the demand was made upon him for payment for <unclear/> horse to the grounds the gate keeper told him that it was not necessary to buy a ticket, that the cash would do as well as a ticket.  Mr. Ostrom paid the fee, fifty cents each time, and each time the gate keeper put the money into his pocket.</p>
                            <p>James Walsh, general manager of the Douglas County Agricultural society, in speaking of the attendance at the State fair said: "I have been attending state fairs for twenty years and think that I can judge something of crowds.  The attendance at the State fair last week was the largest that I ever saw.  I feel certain that there were fully 50,000 people on the grounds last Thursday.</p>
                            <p>"I see that the managers state that the aggregate attendance only reached 58,949 for the week.  Of course they have got the books and know how many people passed through the gates, but if their figures are correct, there is something wrong somewhere."</p>
                            <p>Andrew Kewitt of this city had the bicycle checking privileges and talked with the State fair managers Thursday evening after the close of the day's business.  In that conversation Mr. Kewitt says the managers told him that the attendance for the day would reach close to 45,000 and that the fair was bound to be a grand success, as the attendance of the preceding days had been greater than during the corresponding days of any State fair previously held in Nebraska.</p>

                            <p>Joseph Rawicz, United States consul at Warsaw, Russia, has written to the Department of Publicity to offer his services in aid of the exposition.  He says, in reply to a letter sent him by the department, that he has spread information regarding the exposition about his district and has communicated with the editors of the leading papers of that section, receiving their promises of co-operation and assistance.</p>
                            <p>The Smith-Premier Typewriter company has applied for 180 feet of space for an exhibit, and the United Typewriter Supply company of Omaha has applied for 288 feet of space.</p>
                            <p>The Otto Gas Engine company of Philadelphia has applied for 480 feet of space for an operating exhibit of its make of engines.  These engines will be operated by gasoline, the supply tank being buried in a concrete box several feet under ground at a point remote from any of the buildings, where there will be no danger from fire or explosion.</p>
                            <p>The Merchants' Despatch Transportation company will put one of its refrigerator cars into the Dairy building, where it will be used for the exhibition of perishable goods.  The front of the car will be made of glass so that the entire interior will be visible and it will serve as a refrigerator, as well as being an exhibit of the car.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. W. D. Wilson of this city has applied for fifty feet of space for the sale of souvenir wares.</p>
                            <p>Montgomery, Ward &amp; Co. of Chicago have notified the Department of Exhibits that the will <choice><sic>commenuce</sic><corr>commence</corr></choice> work on their building about October 15.  This building will be quite an elaborate structure, designed for the entertainment of visitors, but not for an exhibition <choice><sic>buildin</sic><corr>building</corr></choice>.  The firm has also offered to donate to the exposition the back cover page on one of <choice><sic>thir</sic><corr>their</corr></choice> handsomely lithographed catalogues which are distributed <choice><sic>al</sic><corr>all</corr></choice> over the country by the thousands and especially over the west.  They will allow the exposition to insert in this space such advertising matter as it desires.</p>
                            <p>The piles for the <choice><sic>foundatio nof</sic><corr>foundation of</corr></choice> the Nebraska building are being hauled on to the exposition ground and the work of driving them will be commenced tomorrow morning.  The piledriver is on the ground and Superintendent Blake says he will commence building his carpenter shop tomorrow and will get the lumber and other material on the ground at once, so as to be ready to commence the erection of the state building as soon as the piles are driven.</p>
                            <p>The Mines building is being pushed by Goldie &amp; Sons as fast as possible.  The floor is being laid and the planing mill plant is being put into the building.  The floor is finished on about one-quarter of the space <choice><sic>an dthe</sic><corr>and the</corr></choice> joists in the remaining portion of the building are being put in place very rapidly by a large force of men.  It is expected to complete the floor within the next two days, and work on the superstructure will be commenced at once.</p>

                            <p>LINCOLN, Sept. 28.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Governor Holcomb and staff are making preparations to go to the Nashville Exposition to be there on "Nebraska day," which is October 8.  The trip will be made unless the spread of yellow fever in the south should make it inadvisable.  Adjutant General Barry wrote to Buffalo Bill, one of the members of the governor's staff, inviting him to be with them at the exposition.  An answer has just been received from Mr. Cody, who is now at St. Louis.  He says that he will be at Nashville on the 7th and 8th with his show, and if the governor and his staff want horses, a band, regular army soldiers as escorts, or if he wants the whole show to turn out it is at his command.  He desires to help make Nebraska day a big feature of the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Drawings of a Proposed Building to Be Exhibited at a Celebration to Be Held Early Next Month.</head>
                            <p>The German-American citizens of Omaha are making preparations to properly celebrate, on October 9, the landing of the first German settlers in Pennsylvania.  The celebration will be held in Germania hall, commencing at 8 p. m., and will comprise a concert, participated in by the Orpheus Singing society, the Zither club and other local talent and a theatrical performance in German.  During the evening a grand tableau will be presented, typifying the Transmississippi Exposition.  The twenty-four states and territories in the transmississippi region will each be represented by a young woman and the entire group will be under the protecting arm of Columbia, personified by a well known Omaha woman.  Speeches by Jacob Houck and Francis Martin, the latter the editor of the German Post-Tribune, will complete this portion of the entertainment, the whole concluding with a ball.</p>
                            <p>The German-American Transmississippi association will take an active part in the celebration, and steps will be taken to arouse the 30,000 German-Americans in the immediate vicinity of Omaha to the importance to them of the great exposition which is almost at hand.  This association was organized and incorporated several months ago for the purpose of advancing the interests of the German citizens of Nebraska in the exposition and the society feels that the time has come to begin active work in enlisting the assistance and co-operation of the German settlers in this work.</p>
                            <p>Handsome drawings representing the building it is proposed to erect on the exposition grounds will be displayed at the entertainment for the inspection of those present.  The drawings will show a building of irregular form, about 200 feet in length along its main front, and having a depth of about 100 feet.  This building will represent the various styles of architecture seen among the historic buildings in the different quarters of Germany, faithfully reproduced with all the appearance of extreme old age.  The interior of the building will be arranged to represent a characteristically German concert hall with a stage on which will be light entertainments such as are seen among the high class German resorts in the larger cities of the "Faderland."  A restaurant for the dispensing of German delicatessen will be given space in the building and there will also be parlors and reading rooms for the use of visitors.</p>
                            <p>The committee having charge of the celebration of the landing of the first German settlers in Pennsylvania comprises Charles Kaufmann, Francis Martin, F. W. Koetter, Carl Rumohr and Frank Christman.  This <choice><sic>committe</sic><corr>committee</corr></choice> has sent invitations to all of the German societies in this city and the immediate vicinity and these societies have been requested to bring with them their banners to be used in decorating the hall where the celebration is to be held.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Executive Committee Considers the Director Question.</head>
                            <p>At a special meeting of the executive committee of the exposition yesterday afternoon Chairman Lindsey stated that he had called the meeting to take up the question of the music for the exposition.  He called attention to the action of the committee several weeks ago in dividing the music into two classes, giving the Ways and Means department charge of all music furnished for which no admission was charged, or from which no revenue is to be derived; and giving to the Department of Concessions all music for which an admission is charged, such as oratorios, concerts, choruses, etc.  Mr. Lindsey said he regarded this division as impracticable and said he had concluded, after a thorough investigation, that the whole business of music should be put under one department, regardless of what department might be selected.  He advocated the election of a musical director and the organization of choruses, collections of singers for giving oratorios, engaging of bands and orchestras for the giving of musical performances of a high nature.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Reed, to whose department the concession features of the musical bureau had been referred, took a position diametrically opposite that of Mr. Lindsey and maintained that no director was necessary, that choruses should not be attempted and that it was only necessary to employ established musical organizations to furnish such entertainment as might be desired.</p>
                            <p>After some discussion the whole matter was referred to a committee consisting of President Wattles and Managers Lindsey and Reed, to make a recommendation as to what should be done with the music of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall recommended the employment of Luther Steringer of New York City, an electrician of prominence, as consulting electrical engineer for the exposition.  Mr. Kirkendall explained that Mr. Steringer was the electrician who designed the electrical fountains at the World's fair and who had charge of the electrical construction at the Chicago, Atlanta and San Francisco expositions.  He said Mr. Steringer had consented to give his services in making the plans for the electric lighting of the exposition, and in acting in an advisory capacity during the installation of the work, making merely a nominal charge.</p>
                            <p>After a brief discussion the matter was laid over until the regular meeting Friday of this week.</p>
                            <p>It was decided that the time has arrived when the landscape engineer, Rudolph Ulrich, should be recalled to Omaha to take charge of the laying out of the grounds and the making of the necessary walks, preparing for the landscape features of the grounds, and planting such of the ornamental trees, shrubs, etc., as should be put in the ground this fall.</p>
                            <p>In this same connection Manager Kirkendall was authorized to employ two or three experienced men in this line to commence the work of laying out the walks and driveways along the lines contemplated by the plans of Mr. Ulrich, which were approved some time ago by the executive committee.</p>

Humphreys of Denver, architect of the Mines building, has been in the city for the last day or two consulting with the supervising architects of the exposition regarding the details for the Mines building.  He visited the exposition grounds and conferred with the contractor for the Mines building and was greatly impressed with the progress which had been made.  Mr. Humphreys brought with him a number of rough sketches of the decorations for the Mines building and conferred with Supervising Architect Kimball regarding these, in connection with other details.  Before leaving the city Mr. Humphreys stated that the people of Denver and of Colorado generally are becoming greatly interested in the Transmississippi Exposition and have determined to be represented in a manner which will place Colorado in a position she should occupy in such an exposition by virtue of her great resources in both mineral and agricultural products.</p>

                            <p>Major Clarkson says that the indications are favorable for a party of fair proportions, but he urges upon the people of this vicinity the importance of taking an interest in this matter of securing a large attendance in order to stimulate interest among the people of that section in the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
                            <p>Efforts have been made to secure a one-fare rate for the whole distance from the railroads, and the major states that he believes this will be accomplished.  Governor Holcomb and his official staff and W. J.

                            <p>The Board of Park Commissioners met yesterday and transacted a considerable amount of business, most of which pertains to the adornment of Kountze park and the exposition grounds next year.  It was decided that the work of propagating plants for the decoration of the park should be begun at the Hanscom park greenhouses at once and it was the sense of the board that the additional plants that would be required for the decoration of the grounds surrounding the park should be purchased from local florists in time for the florists to begin propagating them before winter sets in.</p>
                            <p>The committee on improvements and the superintendent were instructed to complete the addition on the west side of the greenhouse at Hanscom park to afford the extra room required.</p>
                            <p>The superintendent was also instructed to make arrangements at once to ship four or five carloads of the trees recently purchased from ex-Governor Furnas from Brownville to be set out on the boulevard and at the various parks as required.  The same official was directed to raise a large quantity of evergreens at Hanscom park to be subsequently transplanted at Kountze park.</p>
                            <p>The board added a few more cages to the menagerie at Riverview park by accepting the gift of two prairie wolves, a Rocky mountain badger, a coon, eagle, owl, etc., from the Southside Improvement club.  The gift of 100 black bass from Fish Commissioner May was accepted and the fish will be installed in the lake at Riverview park.  The board also accepted two very handsome oleanders from Mrs. J. E. House, which are to be used to assist in the adornment of the exposition grounds.  The watchman at Bemis park was discharged.</p>

The Mines and Mining building presents the busiest scene of any place on the grounds.  About sixty carpenters and about half as many laborers are employed on this building and every man is working as though his job depended on the amount of work he did.  As a result, a good showing has been made.  All of the joists have been put in place and about two-thirds of the flooring had been laid at noon today.  The flooring is two-inch material, four inches wide, and tongued and grooved.  It is being laid in a workmanlike manner and at a rapid rate.  The work of rearing the superstructure will be commenced as soon as the floor is completed, the material being all at hand.  As the work advances more men will be employed until nearly 300 men will be engaged on this one building.</p>
                            <p>The dome of the Manufactures building has been nearly completed and the framework of the building is being rapidly put up.  A gang of men are at work laying the floor and have this branch of the work well advanced.  The floor joists are nearly all in place and the flooring is being laid.  This flooring is the same as that in the Mines building and when it is finished the work will be greatly expedited.  Contractor Strehlow is still being hampered by the failure of some of his big timbers to arrive, but he is working on those portions of the building where these timbers are not required.</p>
                            <p>The piles for the Machinery building are slow in arriving and Contractor Hamilton is being delayed in consequence.  The piles are being driven as fast as received.</p>
                            <p>Considerable difficulty is being experienced in getting a sufficient number of piles for use on the exposition grounds.  Such a large number of these are required that the available supply near the city has been about exhausted, and as the distance from the city increases the time necessary to secure the sticks increases at a rapid rate.  This fact threatens to interfere seriously with the buildings for which piles have not already been secured, including the Machinery, Agriculture, Liberal Arts and Fine Arts.</p>

                            <head type="sub">FILLING THE LAGOON.</head>
                            <p>The lagoon is rapidly assuming the appearance of a genuine lake.  The bottom is completely covered from the extreme west end to a point east of Twentieth street, being a little over half of the whole lagoon.  Little rivulets extend to the extreme east end of the lagoon, and it will be but a few days when the entire bottom of the canal will be covered with water.  The sparkling fluid is flowing into the lake from three pipes located at different points and the steady flow from these comparatively small pipes is having a very perceptible effect.</p>
                            <p>The ditch for the water main on the grounds has been completed along the south side of the main court from Twenty-fourth to Twentieth street and a good start has been made all along the line from Twentieth to Sixteenth street.  This ditch will be completed by tomorrow noon and the work of laying the pipe will be commenced at once.  When this is done water will be turned into the lagoon from a larger pipe and a few days will see a marked change in appearance of the big basin.</p>
                            <p>The railway crossing on Sherman avenue has been completed at the south side of the main court and men are extending the track to the western end of the main court.  This work will be completed tonight and the cars containing the water pipe will be switched onto this track and unloaded alongside the ditch prepared to receive it.</p>
                            <p>The intersection at Sherman avenue at the north line of the main court is all ready to put in place and the work of putting it in was commenced this morning.  As soon as the track is completed on the south side of the main court the gang of track layers will be transferred to the north side and this track will be completed by the last of the present week, after which the carloads of lumber for the big buildings will be switched to the respective buildings and unloaded.</p>
                            <p>The Administration building is being put under roof and the staff workers are following the roofers closely with the ornamental cornice which is to decorate the lofty pinnacles that crown the airy structure.  The highest pinnacle has been completely covered with the roofing material to be used on all the buildings, a new material known as rubberoid, having a surface which glitters like silver in the sun, the millions of minute particles of mice with which the entire surface is covered reflecting the rays of the sun in countless numbers, and the dainty little ornamental cornice joining the roof and the lower portion of the lofty lantern has been put into place.  The finishing touches to the building are being rapidly put on and within the next ten days the building will be practically completed.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Editor Beckman Suggests a Washington Exhibit.</head>
                            <p>A novel suggestion in connection with the Forestry exhibit at the exposition has been made by Editor Beckman of the Pacific Lumber Trade Journal, published at Seattle.  He suggests that in order to make a proper display of Washington's timber resources a log containing 10,000 feet, board measure, be shipped to Omaha and be left on board the car in the grounds for some time during the exposition.  On a certain day he would have it announced that the log will be converted into a house.  For this purpose it would be necessary to secure the co-operation of some of the numerous exhibits of saw mills in operation.  After the log is squared the slabs could be converted into shingles and the sills, studding, siding, flooring and finishing lumber for a story and a half cottage could all be sawed from the big log, dressed in the planing machine and put into the house.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Beckman also suggests that the sawdust and other refuse of the log could be converted into paper by some of the pulp mills on exhibition and made into wall paper for the house.  He further suggests that the other industries of the state might contribute toward the furnishing of the house and a practical demonstration be thus made of the resources of the state.</p>

                            <p>The Northwestern Fire Underwriters association, now in session at Chicago, has broken the record of sixteen years and will meet in Omaha next year.  This is the first time this meeting has been held outside of Chicago for sixteen years, but the persuasive eloquence of Captain H. E. Palmer and H. B. Coryell, the Omaha delegates to the meeting, was too much for the delegates and the time-honored precedent was thrown to the winds and the 600 delegates voted unanimously to meet in the exposition city next year.  This body remains in session at each meeting several days, depending upon the amount of business to be transacted.  The members are nearly all accompanied by members of their families and a considerable portion of the time is spent in social enjoyment.</p>

They make a rate of full tariff on goods en route to the exposition with return transportation free provided the goods have not changed hands in the meantime.

Mr. Sherman stated that he was ready to commence active operations at once and would have the structure well under way within a short time.  The company he represents proposes to expend about $80,000 in the erection of the machine, a considerable portion of this sum to be expended in the foundation and provisions for making the towering structure absolutely safe.  The exact location of the tower has not been definitely fixed, and this was one of the things which occasioned the visit to the grounds this morning.</p>

                            <p>In order to obtain the advantage of the cheapest rate, $18 from Omaha to Nashville and return, it will be necessary to leave here on October 3 or 4, leave St. Louis on October 5 or 6, inspect the exposition before Nebraska day, and leave there for the return trip on the night of October 8.  The rate of $18 from here to Nashville and return is made possible by the fact that a rate of $11.50 for the round trip from here to St. Louis will be offered October 3-9 inclusive, good for return October 11, and the fact that a rate of $6.50 will be in effect from St. Louis to Nashville and return, good going on October 5 and 6, to be used leaving Nashville not later than October 8.

                            <div3>
                            <p>The murmurs of dissatisfaction which have been heard in all quarters for the last three or four months against the arbitrary methods and peculiar practices of Dion Geraldine, superintendent of construction for the Department of Buildings and Grounds of the exposition, broke out at the regular meeting of the executive committee yesterday afternoon when a resolution was introduced providing for the summary discharge of Geraldine for cause.  This resolution was accompanied by a written memorandum setting forth at length a few of the reasons why Geraldine should be let out at once.  This resolution was made the special order of business at a special meeting of the executive committee to be held at the exposition headquarters at 8 o'clock this evening, at which time Geraldine will be given opportunity to be heard if he has any explanation to offer for the many questionable transactions laid at his door.</p>
                            <p>The resolution in question was introduced by Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion and was laid before the committee after the regular business of the meeting had been disposed of.  It was as follows:</p>
                            <p>"Resolved, That the services of Dion Geraldine as superintendent of construction be dispensed with from and after this date in the interest of economy and for cause, as shown by the memorandum herewith submitted."</p>

                            <head type="sub">SOME CHARGES MADE.</head>
                            <p>Attached to this resolution was the following written statement, which may be regarded as charges and specifications on which the demand for Geraldine's discharge was made:</p>
                            <p>Early in July proposals for sheet piling on the lagoon were advertised under plans and specifications prepared by Thomas Shaw, formerly an assistant of the city engineer.  Bids were received under these plans and specifications and opened by Mr. Geraldine, but no bidder was present.  These bids were all rejected by the executive committee.  The day following their rejection one of the bidders, J. P. Connolly, called on Mr. Geraldine and was informed that his bid was altogether too high.  Mr. Geraldine also asked Connolly to submit another bid, which was to be subdivided so as to make proposals for the labor only, while the exposition would furnish all the material.  At the same time Mr. Connolly was asked to submit proposals for the labor only, while the exposition would furnish all the material.  At the same time Mr. Connolly was asked to submit proposals for material and labor on a different plan, viz.: Instead of driving the sheet piling two and a half feet, as designed in the original plan, he was allowed to dig a trench two feet deep and drive the piling six inches.  Connolly submitted two bids, one for all the labor and material on the latter proposition, $7,100, and one for the labor only, $2,100.  Under the original plan his bid was for materials and labor $7,900.  Under the last proposal the specifications were verbal.</p>
                            <p>On August 13 a contract for sheet piling was made with Creedon &amp; Mahoney for the sum of $5,936.50.  The last bid of Connolly for $7,100 included the pile driving.  Creedon &amp; Mahoney's bid did not.  The value of the piles, from Mr. Geraldine's own estimate, was $700.  Added to the bid of Creedon &amp; Mahoney that would have made the cost of the sheet piling $6,536,50.  In the reduction of the size of lumber under the revised plan, which Creedon &amp; Mahoney were allowed to carry out, there was a saving of about 60,000 feet of lumber, which, at $14 per 1,000 feet for yellow pine, would amount to $840, making the total cost on the revised plan equal to $7,376.50, as against $7,100 bid by Connolly.  In addition to this there was omitted from Creedon &amp; Mahoney's work all the iron work, worth at least $200, making a total of $7,576.50.  In substituting yellow pine of second quality for white pine of first quality, there is a difference of $4 per 1,000 feet.  Estimating the quality of lumber used at 170,000 feet, this would make a saving to the contractor of $680, making in all $8,256.50 as against $7,900 as originally bid under the first plans and specifications by Connolly.</p>
                            <p>Instead of making the trench two feet deep, as was required of Connolly under his second bid, Creedon &amp; Mahoney were allowed to make this ditch only twelve inches deep, thus saving twelve inches of digging and one foot of lumber all around the lagoon.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">DONATION TO THE CONTRACTORS.</head>
                            <p>Another and very extraordinary feature of this contract was this: Early in June the exposition was induced to contract with the Cady Lumber company for an invoice of yellow pine lumber which in the aggregate was to cost $3,000.  It was represented by Mr. Geraldine that this purchase would save the exposition several hundred dollars, as the lumber was furnished at a cut rate, much below the prevailing market price.  When the contract to Creedon &amp; Mahoney was awarded this invoice was turned over to the contractors at the instance of Mr. Geraldine, and thus Creedon &amp; Mahoney were given the advantage, as then represented, of about $1.50 per 1,000 on the yellow pine which they purchased, equal to a donation of $250.  Mr. Connolly, who was competing with Creedon &amp; Mahoney, had no such offer, and it is doubtful whether any bidder besides Creedon &amp; Mahoney had the slightest intimation that he would have the privilege of taking this lumber off the hands of the exposition at the cut rate at which it was bought.</p>
                            <p>The specifications of Creedon &amp; Mahoney's contract provide that cement is to be used at each sheet piling, but may be omitted at the option of the exposition.  The cement was omitted, by order of the superintendent, but no allowance whatever was made by the contractor for this omission.  Mr. Geraldine, when asked about this, stated that the cost of cement is no greater than the tamping of the dirt.</p>

                            <p>The exposition paid Creedon &amp; Mahoney $5,936.50, thus paying $1,495.50 more than it should have paid had the contract been awarded on an honest competitive bid.  This is not taking into consideration the advantage of not less than $250 which was given to Creedon &amp; Mahoney by turning over to them the lumber bought by the exposition at cut rates.  It also transpires that the woodwork on the lagoon still remains unfinished and will require a great deal more lumber and carpentry work.</p>

                            <p>On August 27 a request for the employment of H. W. Tamm as assistant superintendent of construction was made by Mr. Geraldine through President Wattles, at a salary of $100 per month.  The executive committee declined to grant the request by refusing to take action.  At that very time, August 26, Mr. Tamm was on the payroll at $4 per day and he was allowed $60 for fifteen days in August, which would make his salary equal to about $112 per month, counting twenty-eight days for the month of August.  In Mr. Tamm's salary voucher he was designated by Geraldine as superintendent of construction, and Mr. Geraldine must know that he is the superintendent of construction, and two men could not well keep the same position at the same time.</p>
                            <p>On August 28 a contract was awarded to John F. Daly for the construction of a sewer, the amount being $809.35.  Mr. Daly has previously been employed as inspector on the ground at $5 per day, while city inspectors for the same work only receive $4 per day.  The contract for this sewer was let without plans or specifications and no bond was asked or given.  After Mr. Daly had completed the contract notice of awarding the contract to him at the price named was filed, with the city specifications for sewerage pinned to the same.  Since Mr. Daly completed the contract he has been re-employed by Mr. Geraldine at $4 per day, under the title of inspector.  During the week in September in which Daly was pretending to act as inspector he was raking up shavings at the bottom of the lagoon, which work was paid for by the exposition and was to have been done by the contractor under the specifications.</p>
                            <p>Soon after Mr. Geraldine was appointed the exposition made a contract with Mr. Ulrich, an eminent landscape architect, to lay out the exposition tract and make ground plans for the same.  Mr. Ulrich came to Omaha and prepared the plane, which were concurred in by Mr. Geraldine and the supervising architects and approved by the board.  It now transpires that the ground plan of the bluff tract has been entirely changed by Geraldine from the plan made by Ulrich.  This change has been made without the knowledge of the manager of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, and without concurrence of the board.  In making this change Mr. Geraldine took it upon himself to employ two men in his office to make the new ground plan for this tract.  This arbitrary action is doubtless largely responsible for the vexing delay in the preparation of sketches of the ground plans.</p>

                            <p>Gross negligence of his duties was shown by Mr. Geraldine in permitting the erection of a planing mill within a few rods of the principal exposition buildings, when he could and should have prevented it.  The construction of such a structure adjacent to the exposition buildings will endanger the buildings and materially increase the rate of insurance upon them, if they can be insured at all.  Inasmuch as Mr. Geraldine has been negotiating for months with the parties that have erected this planing mill he could not have been ignorant of their intentions, especially, also, as he had arranged to leave a gate close to the new building.</p>
                            <p>During the reading of the document Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds shifted uneasily in his seat and when the reading was completed he said he would not pretend to contradict some of the statements made therein, but he said there were some of the statements which were false and malicious and he asked that Geraldine be at once sent for and given an opportunity to explain.</p>
                            <p>Other members of the committee objected to remaining longer at that time and then Mr. Kirkendall insisted that nothing should be made public regarding the matter until after Geraldine had been heard.  Messrs. Lindsey, Reed and Rosewater opposed any attempt to keep a matter secret which came up in the regular course of business before the committee.  Mr. Lindsey remarked that Geraldine's actions had been the subject of criticism in all parts of town and from all classes of people for months, and the executive committee had been severely criticised for not taking action sooner.  He opposed any secrecy in the matter and said Geraldine should be given every opportunity to explain, but it was a matter in which the general public was interested and there was no necessity for secrecy.</p>
                            <p>It was finally ordered that Geraldine should be furnished with a copy of the resolution and attached statement and be given an opportunity to appear before the committee tonight.</p>
                            <p>Before this matter was brought before the committee an extended session was held at which considerable routine business was transacted.</p>

                            <p>The first thing to come before the committee was a communication from a special committee of the Lady Board of Managers appointed to recommend certain matters in regard to the artistic features of the exposition.  This committee consisted of Mrs. Harford and Mrs. Keysor, and they recommended to the executive committee that steps be taken to secure for the decoration of the exposition grounds works of art of permanent material which would remain after the exposition closes and be permanent ornaments for some of the public parks.  The committee especially urged that an arrangement be entered into with Captain Edward Kemys, the renowned sculptor of wild animals and Indians for work in permanent material for the decoration of the grounds.  The woman's committee suggested statues of animals and Indians, and especially an Indian equestrian statue as being particularly appropriate for a western exposition.  The whole matter was referred to the Department of Buildings and Grounds.</p>
                            <p>A letter from S. S. Beman of Chicago, architect of the Manufactures building, was read.  Mr. Beman called the attention of the committee to the fact that the plan for the Manufactures building provided for three large panels in the entrance dome, in which it was designed to place three large paintings illustrating the manufacturing industries.  He said these were as essential to the completeness of the building as any other part of it, and he urged that action should be taken at an early date to provide for these paintings.  He said they should be done on <choice><sic>convas</sic><corr>canvas</corr></choice> and removed from the building after the exposition closes, making valuable souvenirs to be placed in a museum for future generations.  In this connection Mr. Beman suggested an artist of wide reputation whose services he thought could be secured for this work at a merely nominal figure, but he urged the necessity of making early arrangements, as the work would require several months for execution.  The matter was referred to the Department of Buildings and Grounds for recommendation.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall reported that Smith &amp; Eastman were the lowest bidders on the staff work for the Agriculture building, their bid being $12,753.  He recommended that the contract be awarded to them.  His recommendation was adopted.</p>
                            <p>The matter of adopting a brand of cement plaster made in Laramie for making the staff and stucco work was discussed and the matter was referred to the architects for investigation and report.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall was authorized to make arrangements with Luther Steringer, the electrician who designed the electrical effects for the World's fair, California exposition and numerous other large enterprises, to make plans for the Transmississippi Exposition and act as consulting electrical engineer.</p>
                            <p>Manager Bruce announced that he would send W. L. May, the Nebraska fish commissioner, to Washington to confer with W. deC. Ravenal, in charge of the fish exhibit to be made by the government, regarding the consolidation of the government and the exposition fisheries exhibits.</p>

                            <p>Colonel H. B. Maxson, the newly appointed vice president of the exposition for Nevada, appeared before the committee and discussed the part his state will take in the exposition.  Colonel Maxson explained that his state had made no appropriation for making a state exhibit, but said he believed that local pride was strong enough to bring about a display of the resources of the state <choice><sic>tah</sic><corr>that</corr></choice> would be creditable and satisfactory.  He called attention to the fact that Nevada is not by nature an exclusively mining state, but has over 73,000,000 acres of land suitable for farming.  He said that if the politicians ever let go their grip on the state it would advance and that the people out there lived in the hope that they would see the day when this would come about.  He said there are now persons appointed in each county to assist the vice president in collecting material for an exhibit and assured the committee that the state would make a mineral exhibit that would be second to none at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>After Colonel Maxson had withdrawn Manager Bruce brought up the subject of the condition of the mining exhibit in general, to which reference had been made at the last meeting, when the statement was made that the work of securing exhibits was dragging.  He made a statement showing that considerably more than half of the space in the Mines building has already been applied for and that a number of states which are known to be making preparations for a mineral exhibit have not yet made formal application for space.  In this connection Manager Bruce referred to the suggestion of Prof. David R. Day, representative of the Geological survey, regarding the placing of the Mines building under the control of the survey.  Mr. Bruce said it was impracticable to put the entire building under the direction of the government.</p>

                            <p>Prof. Taylor, superintendent of the Bureau of Agriculture, Horticulture, Forestry and Irrigation, reported regarding an interview he had held with J. H. Brigham, assistant secretary of agriculture and chairman of the Government Board of Control for the exposition, in which Mr. Brigham had manifested considerable interest in the idea of making the sugar beet a prominent feature of the government's exhibit.  This idea met with favor on the part of the committee, but no action was taken.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles announced that the railroads had made a rate of one fare for the round trip, or $18, for Nebraska day at the Nashville exposition.  It was also stated that Governor Holcomb and his staff would be transported free both ways.</p>
                            <p>The contracts for the concessions Shooting the Chutes and the Streets of Cairo, by the Omaha Chutes company and Leo Bonet, respectively, were approved.</p>
                            <p>A proposition was submitted to hold an ice carnival on the lagoon during the winter months.  The matter was very favorably regarded by the committee and Mr. reed was empowered to enter into arrangements for making a contract.</p>
                            <p>The special committee appointed at the last meeting to consider the question of music for the exposition, consisting of President Wattles and Managers Lindsey and Reed, reported on a plan, which was adopted without discussion, by which the charge of the music will be divided between the Department of Ways and Means and the president of the exposition.  By this plan the Department of Ways and Means will have control of all the music, fireworks and other forms of amusement intended for the general entertainment of visitors to the exposition, and for which no admission is charged.  The president will have charge of the other music and the general program of the exposition, including designating of special days, musical entertainments for which admissions are charged, etc.</p>

                            <head type="sub">It Says "Marvelous Progress" Is Being Made on Exposition Grounds, But It Is "Not Visible to the Naked Eye."</head>
                            <p>The impression is current in certain quarters that the work of constructing the buildings and grounds of the Transmississippi exposition is not proceeding as rapidly as it should.  People who hold to this impression point to the fact that little progress seems to be making on the grounds and they argue from this premise that the whole is dragging along and that very little is being done.  Plausible as this argument may seem it is erroneous.  While it is true that, to the naked eye, the work seems to drag, yet this is not the case.  This apparent paradox is explained by the fact that the whole work is just at that stage where it is passing out of the chrysalis state into brilliant and forceful life.  The apparent inactivity has really been a condition of inward exertion which has wrought marvelously and this will be apparent to every observer within a short time.&#8212;Monday's Bee.</p>
                            <p>Executive Committeeman Rosewater, having to bear his full share of the public condemnation for the mismanagement and schemes of Geraldine and his "friends" on the directory now comes out with a cock-and-bull story of the "marvelous" progress that is being made in the construction of buildings, etc., on the exposition grounds and wants the public to believe that great progress has been made only that it is "not visible to the naked eye."  If this assertion wouldn't give his readers one of Tibble's "conniption fits" then we don't know what would.  He proceeds by way of apology for making such a ridiculous statement, to tell us that it is an "apparent paradox."  We think it is, and he can no more make the Omaha public believe it, than the state fair management can make us believe that there were less visitors to the fair this year than in 1896.</p>
                            <p>Are we to take opera glasses, field glasses or microscopes with us to the exposition grounds in order to discover this "marvelous" progress, which is invisible "to the naked eye?"  We have been there with two eyes&#8212;and Committeeman Rosewater has no more.  How then did he see this "marvelous" progress, which is invisible to plain, two-eyed, every-day, practical men?</p>
                            <p>Will Mr. Rosewater kindly take a committee up there and lead them around from one "marvelous" structure to another and place their hands upon these "marvelous" buildings and works which are "invisible to the naked eye?"  If we cannot see them nor he either, let us at least have the pleasure of feeling them along with him who believes them to be there, even though we are blind to their presence.</p>
                            <p>We don't believe in the existence of any invisible works under heaven and we demand that Mr. Rosewater produce the "ocular proof" of these invisible marvels.</p>
                            <p>He tells us the work is just about to "pass out of the chrysalis state into brilliant and forceful life&#8212;"  Then we shall all catch butterflies.  This is an old song from an old singer, who has been singing of prosperity and employment for every man who wanted to work for the last twelve months, and who now again says everybody
                            
                            <pb n="55" xml:id="TMISB03-055"/>
                            
                            that can drive a nail as a carpenter will be at work in a week.  He also says "the apparent inactivity has really been a condition of inward exertion (to arrange "grafts") which has wrought marvelously, and this will be apparent to every observer in a short time."  This "inward exertion" has wrought marvelously well for Geraldine and his pals, but judging by the pay roll published last week in THE WESTERN LABROER, the share that has come to labor to be expended in the stores of our business men has been "marvelously" small.</p>
                            <p>Does Mr. Rosewater want the public to believe that $1,341.11 for labor and $4,910.23 for management in August is indicative of this "marvelous and invisible" progress?  The people begin the fear that it is, and are not disposed to stand it much longer.</p>
                            <p>The truth of the matter is that Rosewater and others on the directory are getting ashamed of the whole management.  The honest men on the directory feel that they have been buncoed by Geraldine.  They feel that they have acted the part of as many geese from the start, and now Rosewater kindly comes to the front in their defense with his "invisible" improvements, imperceptible to the "naked eye."</p>
                            <p>We would suggest that Mr. Rosewater bring the county commissioners to see these invisibilities, as he asks them to vote $100,000 in bonds for more of the same kind.  Perhaps the county commissioners are gifted with "second sight," like Mr. Rosewater, and can see this invisible progress which cannot be seen with ordinary eyes.  The editor of the Bee is a wonderful man on paper.  He can construct an exposition or fairy palace in a jiffy, and describe its points and beauties, but he cannot make THE WESTERN LABORER see through his eyes.  We are not believers in miracles, and nothing short of the miraculous can induce the people to accept Rosewater's lame apology for the thimble-rigging and rottenness of the exposition management and until Geraldine is removed confidence cannot be restored be any fairy tales in the Omaha Bee.</p>
                            <p>The Omaha public knows quite well the amount of grading that was required to be done.  The tracts selected were the very best for the purpose, and no grading to amount to anything was required except on the bluff tract, which was done with a machine grader.  Of course the lagoon had to be excavated, but the lagoon is not the exposition.  It is sheer nonsense to tell us how long it took to do this and to do that at the World's Fair.  There is no similarity whatever in the two enterprises, and such twaddle will not serve the men who are responsible for the mismanagement and jobbery in our show.</p>
                            <p>The people have had enough of promises in the newspapers.  They want to see something on the grounds selected for the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Last week a number of farmers called at this office.  They said they came chiefly to see how the exposition was getting on.  One of them said the country was all right; the Dingley tariff bill did it; wheat was $1 a bushel and everything was lovely; but he said that if he belonged to Omaha he would have had the exposition covered up with a blanket so the visitors couldn't see the "progress" that had been made, and they would have gone back to their homes believing what the newspapers said of the great attraction was true.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Suggestion of the Woman's Board for Some Last Memento of the Exposition Favorably Received by the Managers.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The communication sent to the executive committee of the exposition at its last meeting by a special committee of the Board of Lady Managers touched the keynote of a sentiment which has been strongly imbedded in the minds of those who have been mainly instrumental in calling the Transmississippi and International Exposition into being, viz: to have something in the way of permanent buildings or decorations of a high order which may be preserved as lasting monuments of the great show.</p>
                            <p>This special committee of the woman's board consisted of Mrs. Keysor and Mrs. Harford, and they urged upon the executive committee the necessity of at once taking up the matter of making provision for securing works of art of a permanent nature which shall form a part of the decorative features of the exposition and which may be installed in Kountze park of some of the other public parks after the exposition shall have passed into history.  The committee dwelt particularly upon the idea of securing statues of wild animals and Indians for the reason that in a western exposition, such as the Transmississippi Exposition will undoubtedly be considered, it will be particularly appropriate to have artistic representations of the former denizens of the boundless prairies, especially so as the originals of these ideal representations have well nigh disappeared and will soon be numbered among the things of the past.</p>
                            <p>In this communication the special committee suggested that arrangements be made with Captain Edward Kemys, the Chicago artist who has gained wide renown as the greatest living sculptor of American wild animals and Indians.  It was suggested that Mr. Kemys be retained to make a number of statues of peculiarly western design, showing the American Indian as he was at the time when he roamed the boundless prairies undisturbed by the encroachments of the white man, and depicting, also, the American bison, that fleet monarch of the plains who has almost entirely disappeared.  Some of the lesser animals were also suggested as suitable for decorative purposes besides serving as lasting examples of natural history.  It was urged that these statues could be "done" in a permanent material at a slight cost compared with their immense value and utility as works of art of historic value, but the committee was reminded that work of this character required time for its preparation and steps should be taken at an early day to have the work commenced in order to insure its completion by June 1 next year.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">MEMENTO OF THE EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <p>This communication from the Board of Lady Managers was very favorably regarded by some of the members of the executive committee.  Manager Rosewater, especially, urged that decorative material of a permanent nature should be secured in order that the city may have something tangible to show as a memento of the great exposition, and he favored taking prompt action on the suggestion of the women.  The matter was finally referred to the Department of Buildings and Grounds for recommendation.</p>
                            <p>The suggestion on the part of the Board of Lady Managers opens a wide field for securing permanent decoration for the public parks and the museum which is to be established in Omaha sometime.  The scheme of decoration for the exposition offers plenty of opportunities for securing material of this kind.  The arrangement of the main court now provided for statuary on the grand plaza surrounding the lagoon.  At a point on the south side of the lagoon half way between Twentieth and Sixteenth streets, just between the Manufactures building and the Liberal Arts building, there is a sharp incline towards the east, necessitated by the difference in elevation between Twentieth and Sixteenth streets.  A broad inclined plane occupies the middle of the plaza at this point and on either side will be a flight of broad stairs.  Between each of these flights of steps and the inclined plane will be a broad pedestal upon which it is proposed to place a statue of some kind.  At a corresponding point on the north side of the lagoon is a similar arrangement for carrying visitors from a lower to a higher elevation, the two furnishing pedestals for four statues of a large size.  If no other opportunity offered here would be excellent points for the placing of striking figures such as gazed out over the lagoon in the court of honor at the World's fair.  There are other points about the main court where opportunity is offered for the placing of such figures and the park on the bluff tract offers ample opportunity for the placing of an unlimited number of statues of wild animals peculiar to the west.</p>

                            <head type="sub">KEMYS AS A SCULPTOR.</head>
                            <p>In this connection a few words regarding Captain Edward Kemys will serve to recall him to the minds of many citizens of Omaha.  He is best known here by his famous figure of a buffalo's head, which graces the Union Pacific bridge across the Missouri river at Omaha.  This monster head of the former king of the plains is most unfortunately located for the inspection of visitors, however picturesque may be the idea which caused it to be placed where it is, typifying the resentment of the king of the beasts to the encroachment of the iron horse.  This head was made by Captain Kemys, and is only one of the many proofs of his ability as a sculptor of wild animals.  The pair of lions which guard the front entrance of the Chicago Art Institute are his work, and the piece recently placed in the Corcoran Art gallery at Washington, "Fighting Panther and Deer," is considered one of his best efforts.  Mr. Kemys' work at the World's fair also attracted wide attention.</p>
                            <p>Captain Kemys is the founder of a school of art peculiarly his own.  His knowledge of the form and habits of wild animals was gained by tracking the beasts to their lairs and studying them from a convenient covert.  His knowledge of the American Indian was gained on the broad prairie, when the Indian roamed undisturbed by the white man.  The result is seen in the accuracy and freedom which characterized his work, and which make him one of the greatest sculptors of the men and animals characteristic of America and which will soon be seen only in stone.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Mechanical Device and Engineering Novelty Will Be Placed Upon the Old Fair Ground Tract&#8212;Work to Begin Soon.</head>
                            <p>The preliminary details between the management of the Transmississippi Exposition and the company which is to erect on the exposition grounds the engineering novelty known as Sherman's umbrella have been completed and the work of erecting the giant toy which is to form one of the chief attractions of the Plaisance will be commenced within the next thirty days.</p>
                            <p>The plans for the mechanical device which is to be to the Transmississippi Exposition what the Ferris wheel was to the World's fair and the Eiffel tower to the Paris Exposition have been examined by engineering experts and pronounced perfectly feasible and safe.  Before snow flies the huge skeleton framework of the tower will rear its lofty head above the exposition grounds and will form a landmark which may be seen for many miles in any direction from the city.</p>
                            <p>The location selected for the umbrella is on the west side of Sherman avenue, about 300 feet north of the south line of the old fair grounds tract.  Here a space 250 feet square has been set aside for the purpose and the work of construction will soon be commenced.  A hole thirty feet deep and about 100 feet in diameter will be excavated and the framework of the tall shaft will be firmly bedded in concrete.  The "stick" of the umbrella will be an open framework of steel beams, crossed and braced in all directions after the manner of a steel bridge.  The immense ribs of the tower will be bent out from the center at the bottom like the roots of a tree and these will be firmly imbedded in concrete at the bottom of the hole and then the whole excavation will be filled to the top with concrete, making the base perfectly rigid.  The framework construction will be carried to a height of 350 feet at all points.  It is said by competent engineers that this plan of construction will give a tower that will be perfectly rigid and capable of bearing all the strain which could be put on it.</p>
                            <p>The long ribs of the umbrella will be attached at their upper ends to a sliding collar which will be raised to the top of the tower, while the ribs themselves, carrying the carriages, will be raised to a horizontal position at the same time.  When the top of the tower is reached the ribs will be fully extended, forming a circle 250 feet in diameter, after which the carriages will be slowly turned about in a circle and lowered again to the ground.  When lowered the carriages will rest upon a platform twenty feet above the ground, which may be reached by means of steps.  Each of the ten cars will contain forty people, making a load of 400 people at each trip.</p>
                            <p>The exposition management in general and the Department of Concessions in particular feel considerably elated over the fact that the arrangements for securing this decided novelty have all been completed, and they feel that the exposition has taken a long step ahead in getting out of the rut followed by all expositions since the World's fair in being compelled to rely on imitations of the celebrated Ferris wheel for an engineering attraction.</p>

It is expected that at this meeting a definite plan of action will be decided upon and that steps will be taken to raise about $15,000 by private subscriptions for the erection and maintenance on the exposition grounds of a Wisconsin building.  Wisconsin manufacturers have manifested a lively interest in the matter of making exhibits at the exposition and these interests are well represented on the commission having the work in charge.  This commission is constituted as follows:</p>
                            <p>August Uihlein, John C. Koch, John E. Hansen, Ferdinand Kieckhefer, Alfred C. Clas, Colonel J. A. Watrous, Milwaukee; General E. E. Bryant, R. G.

                            <p>The Advisory board to act in conjunction with the Women's Board of Managers is being formed slowly.  The plan of organization of the Woman's board provides for an advisory board consisting of two women from each of the transmississippi states and territories and well known women in each of these states have been asked to accept the positions.</p>
                            <p>The two Minnesota women have accepted and the members of the board for that state of Mrs. T. K. Gray of Minneapolis, chairman of the educational committee of the Minnesota Federation of Woman's Clubs, and Mrs. C. T. Backus of St. Paul, principal of the Baldwin seminary.</p>
                            <p>For Iowa, Mrs. Ella Hamilton Durley of Des Moines, one of the proprietors of the News, has accepted.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Julia Emory, one of the faculty of the State Agricultural college at Bozeman, Mont., will represent Montana on the board, These, together with the women representing Illinois and Texas, whose names were announced recently, constitute the Advisory board so far as it has progressed.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Expects to See an Exhibit from San Salvador.</head>
                            <p>A letter just received by the Department of Publicity and Promotion from Hon. John Jenkins, consul at San Salvador, expresses the hope that the southern republic will be represented at the exposition.  Mr. Jenkins says that upon his introduction to the president of the republic, he suggested to the official that at some other time he would call to present the matter of the exposition and that the president at once expressed considerable interest in the enterprise.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Jenkins says he informed the president that an exhibit by the government was not all that was desired, but that it should show the advantages offered by the country to immigrants and the extent and character of its products and manufactures.  At the present time the republic is embarrassed through financial troubles, and there is considerable excitement over the rebellion in Guatemala, which will make it difficult just now to get a hearing for the exposition.  However, Mr. Jenkins thinks these clouds will pass away shortly and that the government will then take up the question of an exhibit.</p>

                            <p>Owing to a failure of the Cady Lumber company to deliver his material, Contractor R. C. Strehlow this morning laid off twenty-five of his men who were working on the Manufactures building.  The work on this building has been delayed and hampered in every way from the very beginning by failure to get material.  The material that is lacking is the heavy timbers to be used for uprights to form the sides of the building and the galleries, and also the flooring.  The contractor has been compelled to work backwards from the start and has thus lost much valuable time.  When unable to start on the framework, he commenced laying the floor, but this was not all delivered and work was stopped for lack of material.  Being thus stopped at both ends the majority of the men employed were laid off until the arrival of more material.</p>

                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission will meet tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>The bottom of the lagoon is now completely filled with water and the steady flow is gradually creeping up the sides of the big basin, which resembles nothing so much as a big bath tub since the bottom has disappeared from view and nothing is to be seen except the water washing against the vertical sides of the canal.</p>
                            <p>Another lot of piles have been received at the site of the Machinery building and they are being driven in their places.</p>
                            <p>The carpenter shop for the Nebraska building has been completed and the work of driving the piles has been commenced.  About a dozen were put in this morning.  The piles are being received very slowly and the entire first lot were rejected on account of their inferiority.</p>
                            <p>Owing to the temporary absence from the city of General C. F. Manderson, one of the special committee of exposition directors appointed to hear the evidence against Dion Geraldine, it is probable that the hearing will be postponed until Wednesday or Thursday of this week, when General Manderson is expected to be in the city.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Big Force of Men on the Manufactures Building&#8212;Piles for Agricultural Building on the Ground.</head>
                            <p>The delayed lumber for the Manufactures building commenced to arrive this morning, and Contractor Strehlow is pushing the work again.  He says he has enough long timbers on hand to keep him going this week and more on the way and he expects to receive it early next week.  There is a delay in the arrival of flooring and nothing can be done in this direction for the present.  As soon as the long posts are ready to be placed in position work on the building will proceed rapidly.  Contractor Strehlow is now working about forty men.  He says he will double his force within a day or two.</p>
                            <p>The piles for the Machinery building have arrived and they are being driven as rapidly as possible.  Some delay in sawing off the tops of the piles along the front of the building is experienced by reason of the fact that the terrace at this point, which is all filled ground made with the earth taken from the lagoon, was graded about a foot too high, and the workmen have to remove the earth with shovels before they can saw the piles off.  The same thing occurred at the southeast corner of the Manufactures building, where the site was filled nearly two feet higher than the floor of the building, necessitating the handling of the earth twice.  No one seems to know who is directly responsible for these blunders.</p>
                            <p>The raft of piles for the Agriculture building has reached Florence and the logs will soon be landed on the exposition grounds.  A number of them have already been delivered and the pile driver will soon be at work on this building.</p>
                            <p>The construction of the Mines building is delayed somewhat by failure on the part of the railway companies to deliver some of the material for the long posts forming the sidewalls of the building.  The flooring is practically completed and the lumber for the roof is on the ground, but until the posts are received little can be done.  In the meantime the saws and other machinery to be operated by steam are being set up and will be ready for operation within a day or two.</p>
                            <p>The Administration building is making good headway.  The staff is being put on the plain surfaces and the ornamental work is being "pointed up."  The building is taking on quite a handsome appearance and may be seen quite plainly from certain points down town.</p>
                            <p>The plans and specifications for the Arch of the States have been completed and turned over to the Department of Buildings and Grounds to advertise for bids.  The plans call for permanent material in this structure, it being designed for stone.  It is expected that arrangements will be made by which the cost of this building will be brought down to a low figure and a memento of the exposition secured in the form of a stone arch which will be a permanent feature of the Twentieth street boulevard.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Committee Reorganized and Will Begin Its Work Today.</head>
                            <p>A special meeting of the executive committee of the exposition was called yesterday afternoon at the request of President Wattles, who suggested that it would be well to postpone the regular meeting of the board of directors, which is to be held Friday of this week, until Tuesday of next week, on account of the fact that Friday is Nebraska Day at the Nashville exposition and a number of the officers and directors desired to go to Nashville on that occasion to represent the Transmississippi Exposition.  After discussing the matter it was determined that the committee had no power to postpone the meeting of the directors, but it was decided to recommend to the board that it adjourn until next Tuesday.</p>
                            <p>The discussion on this matter turned on the hearing of the charges against Geraldine.  Mr. Wattles said he had no personal interest in the matter except so far as his own acts while in charge of the Department of Buildings and Grounds were concerned and he said he had no fears on that score, as he knew that his acts would bear the most searching investigation, but he said he did not want to have a hearing to be held during his absence and his own acts brought into question and possibly condemned without his knowledge.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater said he had intended to insist on a speedy hearing in the matter.  He said he had no personal feeling against Geraldine, but the duty of the committee was very plain and the charges should be investigated and disposed of without delay.</p>
                            <p>It was stated that General Manderson, one of the special committee of directors appointed to hear the charges, would not return to the city until Wednesday or later, and it was doubtful if he would serve at all; Mr. Wharton was reported to be too busy in court to attend to the matter, thus leaving Mr. Kountze as the only member of the committee who could serve.  It was finally decided to select six directors, from which Chairman Lindsay was instructed to secure two to act with Mr. Kountze and take up the hearing of the charges at once.  These six men were selected: G. F. Bidwell, Lucius Wells, Frank Murphy, J. H. Evans, H. A. Thompsen and C. E. Yost.</p>
                            <p>Upon inquiry it was learned that Mr. Kountze could not be reached in time to hold a meeting last night and the attempt to hold a hearing at that time was abandoned.  The committee will be convened at 8 o'clock this evening and the charges investigated.  Messrs. Bidwell and Wells will act with Mr. Kountze.</p>

There is little business of importance to be transacted and the session will probably be brief.  It is expected that Chairman Neville and Assistant Secretary Dearing will represent the commission on the trip to Nashville.  It was anticipated that the committee appointed at a former meeting to make a report on the amount of money that should be devoted to the several interests in the state which are to be represented in the state exhibit would be ready to make a report at this meeting.  Chairman Poynter of the committee, who arrived in the city this morning, said that the committee would not be ready to report at this time.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The investigation of the charges preferred against Dion Geraldine, the superintendent of construction of the exposition, was commenced last night at the exposition headquarters before a special committee of the directors appointed for that purpose.  A part
                            
                            <pb n="57" xml:id="TMISB03-057"/>
                            
                            only of the testimony was taken, occupying the time until nearly midnight, when an adjournment was taken until 3 o'clock this afternoon.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine's attitude before the committee was one of defiance and arrogance and he frequently interrupted Witness Shaw with charges that he was saying what was absolutely false.  When it came time for him to meet the testimony produced by Mr. Rosewater in support of the charges he had made, Geraldine produced a long type-written document to which he frequently referred in making an explanation, which was verbose and evasive.  He failed to touch upon the vital points in the charges, but spoke in an affected manner of little technical details and minor matters having no particular relation to the case in point.  He admitted the truthfulness of several of the most important point covered by the charges.</p>
                            <p>When the session commenced the special committee, comprising Directors Kountze, Wells and Bidwell, were seated together and Geraldine took a chair directly in front of the court and facing it.  Manager Rosewater, who had preferred the charges, Manager Kirkendall, head of the department with which Geraldine is connected, Managers Bruce and Reed and President Wattles occupied seats in the room.  These constituted the entire party.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield read the lengthy charges for the information of all concerned.  When the reading had been completed Mr. Kountze, who presided, said he supposed the next step would be for Manager Rosewater to produce the proof of his charges, after which Mr. Geraldine could answer the charges and make his defense if he had any.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater suggested that if Mr. Geraldine had any statement prepared it might be filed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Geraldine said he would prefer to hear Mr. Rosewater first before he offered any defense.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SOME QUEER METHODS.</head>
                            <p>The way being cleared, Mr. Rosewater asked Mr. Kirkendall if it was not a fact that the latter had asked the executive committee to authorize the purchase of a lot of yellow pine lumber for about $3,000, it being represented that it could be bought at $1.50 per thousand below the market price, saving several hundred dollars, according to a statement made to him by Geraldine.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kirkendall said this was true.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater then asked if it was not true that the lumber had been purchased before the committee had been asked to authorize its purchase.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kirkendall admitted that this was true.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater then called attention to the fact, which he said he was prepared to prove, that J. P. Connolly, a bidder on the work, had offered to do all the work on the sheet piling for $2,100, the exposition to furnish the material.  He emphasized this point and called attention to the fact that if Connolly's bid had been accepted and the material purchased for $3,000, as stated by Mr. Kirkendall, the whole job would have cost but $5,100; whereas Creedon &amp; Malonet were paid $5,936.50 for the work.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater charged that the plans and specifications on which bids had been asked had been manipulated and changed in the most arbitrary manner and that Creedon &amp; Mahoney had been allowed to complete the work in a way which had saved over 50,000 feet of lumber as compared with the amount called for by the plans under which they were supposed to work.  In this connection Mr. Rosewater read a written statement made by Thomas Shaw, a civil engineer of thirty-five years experience, who had been in the city <choice><sic>engnieer's</sic><corr>engineer's</corr></choice> office for a number of years and who had assisted J. P. Connolly to prepare his bid.  It also developed that Mr. Shaw was the engineer employed by Geraldine to make the plans and specifications on which bids for the piling were asked and was, therefore, thoroughly familiar with the details of construction called for by the plans.  He wrote that he had visited the exposition grounds on other business, but had taken pains to examine the work, which was then (September 13) under progress.  He made the following statements regarding the manner in which the work was being done:</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SHAW MAKES A STATEMENT.</head>
                            <p>"I found the coping 8x4 inches instead of 12x4 inches, saving about 7,000 feet of lumber.  Instead of having a front waling half way between the ground and coping, as shown on plans, 8x3 inches, they have put in pieces between piles on the back of the sheet piling 6x3 inches, saving 2,500 feet more, making a total of 9,500 feet of lumber saved in addition to what has already been reported to you, 58,500 feet.</p>
                            <p>"The circular coping at the ends of the lake was to have been of sufficient breadth to dress down to twelve inches in breadth all around, but they have just used the eight-inch coping, which, on being dressed to the curve, only leaves six inches of width at the center between piles.  The piles are set further apart than the specifications called for, I estimated, from several measurements I made, that they have saved at least sixty piles by altering the spacing.  Many of these piles are of very inferior quality, being absolutely rotten, and there is not 10 per cent of them of the size called for in the specifications&#8212;some of them are mere fence posts.  The sheeting that is already put in place is of the thickness called for, but I noticed several thousand feet which apparently had lately been delivered on the ground and it is only two and one-half inches <choice><sic>thinck</sic><corr>thick</corr></choice>, instead of three inches.  It looks to me that they are going to use it.</p>
                            <p>"The pile driving has been done in the most reckless and careless manner.  To get the sheeting lined up properly some piles are cut more than half through.  The tops of the piles in many places have been driven too low, necessitating the use of packing pieces to bring them to level of coping, contrary to the specifications.</p>
                            <p>"The sheet piles are tongued and grooved, but it is a perfect farce, as the tongue and groove is only three-eighths of an inch deep and they might as well have used plain joints for all the good it will do as it is.  I did not see where they had used any white lead on the joints.  There are no wood screws for securing coping to piles, are required by specifications, they are simply nailed to the piles with 50-penny nails; the nails should be 6-penny for nailing the sheet piling to the coping.</p>
                            <p>"Quite a lot of the lumber used is of very inferior quality and the workmanship all through is simply barbarous.  I found joints from one-eighth inch to one-quarter inch wide on the completed work."</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">ESTIMATE BY BULLARD.</head>
                            <p>Following this, Mr. Rosewater said he had had a detailed schedule made showing the amount and kind of material used in the piling of the lagoon, and this schedule he had submitted to W. C. Bullard, of the firm of Wyatt-Bullard Lumber company, wholesale dealers in lumber, and also to an experienced builder.  Mr. Rosewater submitted the estimates made by both parties.  Mr. Bullard stated in writing as follows:</p>
                            <p>"The above bill of lumber any dealer in Omaha would have been glad to have filled from August 1 to August 15 on a basis of $13.50 per 1,000 feet, free on board cars at Omaha.  The same bill, in white pine, would have cost $3 and possibly $4 per 1,000 feet, free on board cars at Omaha.  The same bill, in white pine, would have cost $3 and possibly $4 per 1,000 feet more, as ten and eighteen-foot lengths of 3x12 in white pine are extremely scarce and cost from $1.50 to $2 more than sixteen-foot lengths, and nearly two-thirds of this boll is composed of these two items.  August 13 the regular price for yellow pine dimension lumber was only $13 per 1,000 feet delivered in town in small bills.  The regular price of 3x12, delivered in small quantities, was only $15 per 1,000 feet."</p>
                            <p>The estimate of cost as made by the builder referred to was the same as that of Mr. Bullard.</p>
                            <p>Taking these figures as a guide, as using Connolly's bid of $2,100 for labor alone, Mr. Rosewater argued that the whole job, allowing $500 for piling, should have cost but $5,600, whereas Creedon &amp; Mahony had been paid $5,936.50, the piling had cost $700, making a total cost of $6,636.50, or an overcharge of $1,036.50 above what the work should have cost.</p>
                            <p>At this point Mr. Rosewater asked Mr. Geraldine if Connolly had been given an opportunity to bid on the work on the same conditions as Creedon &amp; Mahoney.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Geraldine asked the committee if he was obliged to answer the question.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kountze said he thought the question should be answered and all the facts brought out.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Geraldine said Connolly was not given the opportunity.</p>
                            <p>This closed the piling matter and the irregularity in the employment of H. W. Tamm, who has been on the pay roll since early in August at $4 per day, although the executive committee refused to authorize his employment was next taken up.  Mr. Rosewater explained the details of this transaction.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kountze asked if Mr. Geraldine had any authority to employ people on his own motion.</p>
                            <p>The rules of the executive committee were produced and showed that no authority of this kind had been granted.  Mr. Rosewater said it was manifestly impossible for the executive committee to pass upon every laborer employed by the department, but he called attention to the fact that the action of Mr. Geraldine in asking the authority for Tamm's employment showed that he recognized the authority of the committee in that instance.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">THAT SEWER CONTRACT.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater next took up the charge regarding the letting of a contract for sewer on the exposition grounds to John F. Daley at a time when Daley was on the pay roll of the Department of Buildings and Grounds.  Daley's bid was $1.48 lower than the next lowest bidder.  Mr. Rosewater said no specifications had been furnished the bidders and Daley had not signed any contract and no form of document had been signed until after the work had been completed and Daley paid for his work.  In this connection Mr. Rosewater read two statements made by Contractor Sharpe, the bidder to whom the sewer contract was first awarded.  The statements were to the effect that after the notice of the award to Sharpe had been printed in the papers Mr. Geraldine told Sharpe that no such action had been taken and that the contract had not been awarded to him.  When Sharpe told Geraldine that he had seen the statement in The Bee, Mr. Geraldine said that "anything you see in that paper is a lie."</p>
                            <p>Regarding the sewer matter, Mr. Rosewater stated that within the last day or so, when it was desired to make a connection with this sewer, the Y for making the connection with the sewer could not be found.  Daley was called in and he and the engineer on the grounds spent the whole day and dug up several feet of the sewer trench looking for the Y, but could not find it and were finally obliged to break into the sewer and rebuild a part of it in order to make the connection.  Mr. Rosewater asked Geraldine what he knew about that matter, but Geraldine pretended ignorance of the whole subject.  Mr. Rosewater said he was prepared to prove and would later call the engineer to prove the truth of this charge, although he said he wished it to be distinctly understood that the engineer had not given him the information.</p>
                            <p>In this connection Mr. Rosewater remarked, incidentally, that Geraldine had a complete system of spies on the ground and that the movement of every visitor whom Geraldine had reason to suspect might be watching for crooked work was watched by one or more of these spies and such visitors were followed all over the grounds and watched until they left the neighborhood, and their every act reported to Geraldine.  Mr. Rosewater said he would prove this statement when the proper time came.</p>
                            <p>Regarding the planing mill erected against the exposition fence, Mr. Rosewater said that Geraldine should have known of it and notified the executive committee of what was going on.</p>
                            <p>The charge regarding the change of the ground plan on the Bluff tract was dismissed by Mr. Rosewater, who said he did not care to put the committee to the trouble of studying over the details of the plans.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">GERALDINE AT THE BAT.</head>
                            <p>This completed Mr. Rosewater's direct presentation of his case and Mr. Geraldine was given the floor.</p>
                            <p>Taking up the charge regarding the contract with Creeden &amp; Mahoney, Mr. Geraldine said the first bids were opened by himself and Mr. Kirkendall in the presence of one of the clerks of the department and rejected because too high.  With reference to Kirkendall's admission that the lumber had been bought before authority was asked, Geraldine gave Kirkendall the lie by implication.  He said Kirkendall went to a meeting of the committee immediately after it had been decided best to purchase the lumber and before the order had been given.</p>
                            <p>The first direct answer to the charges was the statement by Geraldine that it was untrue that the lumber used was second quality yellow pine.  He insisted that the material was first quality.  He then produced the bids for piling the lagoon together with a lot of bids he had received from lumbermen while he was figuring with them previous to asking for bids for the whole work.</p>
                            <p>Referring to these, it was shown that the price quoted for yellow pine was $14.50 per thousand.  Mr. Rosewater asked Mr. Geraldine if he did not know that the open market price at that time, as shown by Mr. Bullard's statement, was $1 lower.  Mr. Geraldine replied that he did not know it.  He attempted to explain this by saying that this lumber was of a much higher grade than could be bought in open market and was one-fourth of an inch thicker than the usual run of lumber and was tongued and grooved after a special design furnished by Mr. Geraldine.  He said the lumber was bought for about $3,000, and it was turned over to Creedon &amp; Mahoney, they paying for it.  In reply to a question by Mr. Wells, Mr. Geraldine said he had offered this opportunity to only Creedon &amp; Mahoney and to no others.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Geraldine denied, point blank, that Connolly had offered to furnish the material and do all the work for $7,100, or do the work alone for $2,100.  He read what he said was Connolly's bid, in which it was stated that the material would be furnished and work done for $7,800, or the work alone would be done for $2,800, with an allowance of $700 in each case if the piling was set in a trench without being driven and the dirt tamped about it.  He then detailed his negotiations with Creedon &amp; Mahoney and his recommendation that the work be awarded to them.  With reference to the use of cement, Mr. Geraldine said that the tamping of the dirt about the bottom of the piling cost the contractor more than it would have cost to have cement and he said it was better.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">DOESN'T LIKE TO ANSWER.</head>
                            <p>Before leaving the question of the lagoon piling Mr. Rosewater asked two or three questions regarding the plans.  Mr. Geraldine refused to answer, saying he had said all he cared to and didn't propose to be quizzed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater insisted upon a respectful answer to a pertinent question and said he didn't propose to be insulted by an employe.  He then asked Mr. Geraldine if it wasn't a fact that one of the employes in 
                            
                            <pb n="58" xml:id="TMISB03-058"/>
                            
                            his office owned a piledriver which is in constant use on the grounds and is directly interested in contracts for piledriving on the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Geraldine answered slowly that such was the case.  He attempted to explain the by saying the machine had been hired from John Templeton, a clerk in his office, and was operated by a man named Green.  He knew nothing about Templeton's interest in the machine.  It was used in driving the piling for the Mines building and other contracts on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>He had intended to employ Thomas Shaw, the engineer who made the original plans for the sheet piling, as foreman on the work, but learned that he was associated with Connolly, and had decided not to employ him.  He denounced the statements of Shaw regarding the manner in which the piling was done as absolute falsehoods.</p>
                            <p>At this point Mr. Shaw was called at the request of Mr. Rosewater to tell his side of the story.  Mr. Shaw explained that he was not interested with Connolly at the time the bids for the piling were submitted, but had assisted him in making his bod and was familiar with the facts.  He said after the bids were submitted Connolly called at Geraldine's office, but returned to say that Geraldine would give him no information about the matter except to tell him that he was "not in it, anyway."  Connolly visited Director Hussie, who went to Manager Kirkendall, and Geraldine then treated Connolly with more consideration.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">FAVORED THE WINNING FIRM.</head>
                            <p>Shaw denied most positively that either he or Connolly knew of any change in the plans until after Creedon &amp; Mahoney had been given the contract.  He said Connolly's bid was based on furnishing white pine at $18 per thousand, as he could not make a contract with a dealer to furnish yellow pine in time to complete the work at the time required.  Mr. Shaw then explained the manner in which the work was done, stating that some of the piles were driven so poorly that it was necessary to cut them more than three-quarters through in order to straighten up the sheet piling, making these cut piles absolutely worthless in case any strain is put on them.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Geraldine denounced this statement as a falsehood, and Mr. Shaw invited the committee to go with him and he would be pleased to show the piled which had been so cut.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Shaw then explained to the committee the saving in lumber made by the changes in the plans under which the work was finally done as compared with the specifications bid on by Connolly.  He read detailed figures, showing that the change made a difference of 49,639 feet, allowing a wide margin and giving Creedon &amp; Mahoney the benefit of the doubt.  He said Connolly was given no opportunity to take the lumber bought by the exposition and base a bid on that.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The State fair trains of the Union Pacific railroad, the Missouri Pacific railroad and the Omaha Street Railway company carried more people to the State fair grounds during the fair last month than there were total admissions, according to the statement given out by the board of managers of the State fair.  Just what the several thousand people who went out to the State fair grounds but did not go in did to while away their time is not known, but it is presumed they stood about the fences and looked in.</p>
                            <p>Ever since the very remarkable statement of the State fair boards was made public a fortnight ago, Omahans have been inclined to believe that the figures of the admissions had been juggled with.  This belief was confirmed this morning when the passenger department of the Union Pacific railway completed its count of tickets taken up on State fair trains from Omaha, South Omaha and Council Bluffs to the fair grounds.</p>
                            <p>Here are the figures that show that more people went to the grounds than there were total admissions, according to the State fair board's report:</p>

                            <p>The total attendance, including both paid and free admissions, as reported by the Board of Managers of the State fair, was 58,949.</p>

                            <p>The 60,332 passengers hauled by the railroads to the State fair grounds exceed the number of total admissions reported by the State fair management by 1,383, and does not include the people who went to the grounds via other routes.  It has been estimated by persons who were on the grounds throughout the week that at least 5,000 people went to the fair during the five days its gates were open by other means than steam or electric cars.  It is considered a very conservative <unclear/> were about the gates during the entire fair that the number who drove in from the surrounding country was larger this year than ever before.</p>
                            <p>Both the Burlington and the Elkhorn railroads brought people from their various lines into the State fair grounds direct.  The number who went directly to the State fair grounds without entering Omaha was smaller this year than in previous years, but 2,500 is regarded as a fair estimate for this class by railroaders who looked after this travel.  The Elkhorn's State fair coupons number something more than 3,200.  An official of that road said this morning that he thought 50 per cent of this number went directly to the State fair grounds.  This would by 1,600.  The Burlington switched cars from incoming trains at Deerfield for the State fair grounds on three days of the fair, and 900 is considered a fair estimate for the people who went to the fair on the Burlington trains.</p>
                            <p>The addition of 47,180 hauled by the Omaha street railway, 8,905 by the Union Pacific, 4,247 by the Missouri Pacific, 5,000 who drove, rode and walked to the grounds and 2,500 who were taken directly to the grounds by the Burlington and the Elkhorn railroads makes a total of 67,832 people who were at least taken to the State fair grounds.</p>
                            <p>This number exceeds the number of total free and paid admissions reported by the State fair management by 8,883.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MANY EXCUSES FOR HIS SHORTCOMINGS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Evidence is All Submitted and the Committee Takes the Subject Under Consideration Before Deciding.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The investigation of the charges preferred against Dion Geraldine, superintendent of construction of the Department of Buildings and Grounds of the exposition, was concluded last evening about 7 o'clock after a session commencing shortly after 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon.  The special committee will hold a conference this afternoon to consider the evidence introduced and may defer its findings until after the return of President Wattles from Nashville, as his name as been mentioned in connection with several of the events connected with the matters referred to in the investigation.</p>
                            <p>The session yesterday was similar to that of the night before, the special committee, Messrs. Kountze, Bidwell and Wells, being present and the executive committee being represented by Managers Rosewater, Bruce and Reed, with Manager Babcock present a portion of the time.</p>
                            <p>When the session commenced Mr. Rosewater said he wanted to ask Geraldine a few questions in order to get the data all together.</p>
                            <p>Questions were propounded and answers were made as follows:</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I want Mr. Geraldine to state as far as he knows the quality of the lumber purchased by the exposition and turned over to Creed &amp; Mahoney.  Geraldine&#8212;I don't recollect; I judge it was about 170,000 feet.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Mr. Geraldine, in order to make the point clear, did the association buy any lumber and pay for it, or did it simply make a contract for lumber and transfer the contract to Creedon &amp; Mahoney?  Geraldine&#8212;They made a contract for the lumber and transferred the contract.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;They never made the purchase?  They never received the lumber themselves?  Geraldine&#8212;No, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;But they did make a contract by which they were to take a certain quantity of lumber, and that contract was referred to Creedon &amp; Mahoney, and that was probably 175,000 feet?  Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir; in that vicinity.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Now, have you that contract?  Geraldine&#8212;There was no contract.  It was a verbal order, and a pencil memorandum for the amount of lumber required.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">NO AGREEMENT IN WRITING.</head>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Have you no agreement in writing by which the lumber company fixed the price at which that lumber was to be delivered for the exposition?  Geraldine&#8212;No, sir.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;You stated that the lumber was bought at $14.50 per thousand?  Geraldine&#8212;Yes.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Was that all the lumber used in the lagoon?  Geraldine&#8212;No, sir.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;How much other lumber was there used?  Geraldine&#8212;I should judge that&#8212;.  I don't know how much.  The contractor probably had to get more&#8212;probably 20,000 feet.  I don't know.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Is that also yellow pine from the same yard?  Geraldine&#8212;Furnished by the same people.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;So that all in all there would have been 195,000 feet in the lagoon in its construction?  Geraldine&#8212;Somewhere in the vicinity of 200,000 feet.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Now you stated that the piles and the driving of the piling was $779?  Geraldine&#8212;Yes.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;That, with the lumber got, was all the material used in that lagoon, was it not, and included the labor of driving the piles?  Geraldine&#8212;I do not know as I understand your question.</p>
                            <p><unclear/> people and bought by the exposition, together with 195,000 feet of lumber which Creedon &amp; Mahoney had purchased and supplied, was all the material used in that lagoon, was it not?  Geraldine&#8212;No, I think not.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;What was there besides?  I am talking of material now.  Geraldine&#8212;There were cables for anchoring the posts, the nails and the white lead or paint that was used.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;How much white lead was used?  Geraldine&#8212;I do not know.  It was put on the west end of the lagoon for about half or two-thirds the distance around.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I notice that in this bill (I presume it is receipted) the amount charged as the cost of piles is $345.89, and the labor is $419.40.  In round figures, then, the labor which the exposition has bought is equal to $400.  Now, Mr. Geraldine, you stated yesterday that Connolly offered to do the labor for $2,800.  Is that correct?  Geraldine&#8212;I think the bid shows that.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SAYS THE BID EXPLAINS.</head>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Did that include the work of pile driving and completing all that work?  Geraldine&#8212;His bid will explain.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I have not examined the bid, and I want to know that because I want a clear idea of it.  Geraldine&#8212;Yes, I think his bid included all the labor.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;So that, deducting what you have paid already, say $100, there would have been only $2,300 to add for Mr. Connolly if he had done that work under his bid?  Geraldine&#8212;I think there is about $80 of that that was paid for the use of the piledriver, or for repairing.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Is that charged to the labor?  Geraldine&#8212;I think so; it is included in the complete work.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;The reduction was about $80?  That would make the computation of all the labor equal to $2,380?  I am talking about separating the materials from the labor.  The 195,000 feet at $14.50 per thousand would be equal to $2,827.50.  To that should be added for piles and pile-driving together $779.93, and the estimated labor for which it could be done or bought of Connolly we would put at being equal to $2,380.  I want to ask now how much in round figures, the value of the white lead, the nails and the anchoring would be, in round figures?  Geraldine&#8212;About $400.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;We will place that at $400.  But you are aware, I suppose, that only a very small part of that work was leaded?  Geraldine&#8212;No, I didn't say so.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;That is the way it is represented to me.  Geraldine&#8212;I did not represent it so.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Very well.  We have then a general computation as regards what the cost of this work would have been had the exposition bought the material as it originally had done so, paid for all the labor and completed the work on its own account.  Was the bid of $2,800 for labor made by Connolly on the original specifications or on the revised specifications?  Geraldine&#8212;On the modified and revised specifications.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WANTED A SPECIAL DESIGN.</head>
                            <p>Recurring to the statement made to the executive committee by Manager Kirkendall that the exposition could save $1.50 per thousand by buying the lumber direct from the mill, Mr. Geraldine said there was a misunderstanding about the matter.  He said he explained to Mr. Kirkendall that he (Geraldine) wanted lumber sawed one-quarter of an inch thicker than the regular stock and tongued and grooved to a special design.  He did not explain just why ordinary three-inch lumber, tongued and grooved in the ordinary way would not answer.  He said if the contractors had been asked to bid on this material they would have bid $2 or $3 higher per thousand.  He explained how he called in a representative of the Cady Lumber company and gave him the order for the lumber.</p>
                            <p>In reply to questions, Mr. Geraldine stated that the lumber delivered on the grounds was dressed on one side and measured slightly less than three inches in thickness.</p>
                            <p>At this point, William Mulhall, an expert in lumber, who has been employed in local lumber yards for the past seventeen years, was called by Mr. Rosewater.  He produced a short piece of planking, which he said he had measured a large number of planks and found them all of the same thickness and found the lumber to be a very poor quality of yellow pine, full of knots and cracks, and lumber that would not grade No. 2 in any market.  He said the stuff was entirely too dry to use in water, and the knots were loose and would soon fall out.  The lumber is of a kind that is not used for anything but inside of buildings and places where it is covered.  He said it would not last more than two and one-half years in water.</p>
                            <p>When Mulhall had retired, Mr. Geraldine said the lumber used was the best lot he had ever seen.  He said that yellow pine would shrink in the drying kilns and this lumber, when received on the ground, had measured two and seven-eighths inches.  He accounted for the fact that the lumber is now only two and three-quarters inches by saying the shrinkage was caused by the sun.  Regarding the life of the lumber in water he said it would last ten years or longer.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield, who was in the lumber business for several years, was called and testified that three-inch lumber dressed on one side would measure two and five-eighths inches in thickness, whether steam dried or air dried.  If a special order was given to be furnished at a special time there would not be time enough, under the conditions governing in the case under consideration, to dry the lumber very much in the proper manner.  He estimated the life of yellow pine in water at from twelve to fifteen years.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="59" xml:id="TMISB03-059"/>
                            
                            <p>Mr. Geraldine then mentioned a number of details regarding the doing of the work and spoke of the white lead used in the work.  He said he had caused white lead to be put in the specifications so it could be used all around if found necessary.  He said he found that it would not be necessary to use the lead all around, but it had been used only about half way around.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">MADE NO REDUCTION.</head>
                            <p>In reply to a question from Mr. Rosewater Mr. Geraldine said no reduction had been made by the contractor on this account, but it has been applied as an offset against claims made by the contractor for alleged extra work, and the contractor had been paid in full.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wells, one of the investigating committee, asked if these facts had ever been reported to the executive committee.  Mr. Geraldine replied that the matter had been talked over with Mr. Wattles, but had never been brought before the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>J. P. Connolly, the bidder on the piling mentioned by Thomas Shaw, was called.  He substantiated all that Shaw had said and emphasized the fact that his second bid had been made on exactly the same specifications as the first bid, except that he offered a reduction of $700 if allowed to set the piles in a trench instead of driving them.  He stated very positively that he was not told and did not know anything about the change in the use of wire for bracing instead of timber.  He said his bid for doing all the work on the job, including driving piles and all other work, the exposition to furnish the material, was $2,800, with an allowance of $700 if allowed to set the sheet piling in a trench instead of driving it.  (The latter method was the one adopted and used by Creedon &amp; Mahoney.)</p>
                            <p>Mr. Connolly said if he had been allowed to bid on the plans on which the work was actually done by Creedon &amp; Mahoney he would have offered to complete the work for about $7,200, using clear white pine of the first quality, making a reduction of $700 from his first bid on account of the saving in the amount of material used.  He said if he had been offered the lumber at $14.50, the price Geraldine said the lumber cost he would have made a further reduction of $437.50.  He stated most positively that he had not been given an opportunity to take the lumber bought by the exposition.  Mr. Connolly said he figured his lumber at $18, as that was the lowest price he could obtain.  He said he had this figure from the Wyatt-Bullard Lumber company and did not know that the Chicago Lumber company and Hoagland had offered to furnish the material for $14.50 for white pine and $13.50 for yellow pine, both tongued and grooved and dressed on one side.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater demanded of Geraldine why he had not told Connolly of the fact that he had ordered the lumber and give him an opportunity to bid accordingly.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Geraldine evaded this question and further attempts to make him answer similar questions were also fruitless.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">DESIGNS ON CONNOLLY'S NECK.</head>
                            <p>Connolly then stated that the first time he knew that a change had been made in the plans for the lagoon piling was about two weeks after the contract had been awarded to Creedon &amp; Mahoney.  He happened to be in Geraldine's outer office and saw the changed plans and expressed his disgust in a somewhat loud voice, saying he was tired of having bids opened in private.  Afterward Geraldine sent word that he would wring Connolly's neck.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater then questioned Geraldine closely regarding the lagoon contract and Geraldine admitted that if the exposition had paid for the lumber and taken Connolly's bid for doing the work about $700 could have been saved.  Geraldine said he had stated this to President Wattles, who said there was so much objection to doing work without contracts that it was not advisable to do the work that way and it was then let to Creedon &amp; Mahoney.  Geraldine admitted that the pile driving on the lagoon had been done by the exposition without a contract.</p>
                            <p>The employment of W. H. Tamm as superintendent of construction was next taken up.  Geraldine laid great stress upon the necessity of having on the ground a man whom he could absolutely trust, as it was necessary to see that the plans and specifications were complied with.  He sent for Tamm and asked him what he would work for.  Tamm wanted $7 per day, but Geraldine said he succeeded in <choice><sic>geting</sic><corr>getting</corr></choice> him down to $4.  He reviewed Tamm's history since the commencement of the World's fair, where both were employed.  He followed Tamm's travel all over the country to the Chicago drainage canal, where he was in the employ of Geraldine, who had a contract on the canal.  Mr. Rosewater insisted that the tale should be cut short.  He said the committee and the others present had something else to do, while Mr. Geraldine could stay all winter as long as his salary went on at the rate of $18 per day.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Geraldine insisted that he had requested Tamm's employment of the committee the day before he was employed and had received no notice of any action by the committee.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater demanded to know why Geraldine has designated Tamm as "superintendent of construction," when that was his own title.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Geraldine said he had been employed as superintendent of the Department of Buildings and Grounds.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater insisted that this was not the case and said Geraldine had taken it upon himself to make contracts in his own name and carry on things with a high hand.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">RECORDS AGAINST HIM.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Geraldine retorted that this was not a fact, and in reply to this Mr. Rosewater produced one of the early contracts executed by "Dion Geraldine, general superintendent," and made subject all the way through to his approval.  This was passed around by the committee and examined by the members.</p>
                            <p>Committeeman Wells asked several pertinent questions of Manager Kirkendall regarding the authority given Geraldine, bringing out the statement that the latter had no authority whatever, but was supposed to submit everything to Manager Kirkendall for approval before taking any action.</p>
                            <p>The letting of a sewer contract to John F. Daley without plans, specifications, contract or bond, was next taken up and Geraldine made a statement regarding the matter.  He insisted that complete plans and specifications had been furnished bidders.  He reviewed the circumstances surrounding the opening of bids and said he considered the execution of a formal contract on a job requiring only ten days or two weeks for its execution as entirely unnecessary.  He even deemed it unnecessary to have an inspector on the work, but inspected it himself.  He said he did not consider it necessary to exact a bond because Daly asked for no pay until the work was completed.  Geraldine said that Daley had been employed by the exposition as an inspector previous to his sewer contract, but was not so employed on the exposition work after the completion of his sewer contract.  Geraldine praised Daley very highly as a competent man and a reliable inspector.</p>
                            <p>When Mr. Geraldine had completed his statement, Mr. Rosewater denounced the whole story as a very smooth evasion of the real issue and full of misstatements.  He then reviewed the whole matter and showed that the Daly matter had been pushed through under whip and spur, and the wool pulled over the eyes of the committee at the instigation of Geraldine.  He presented the alleged contract which had been executed and filed after the work was all completed, and dated back to the day the contract was awarded.  He charged that in carrying out the work Daley had used cement belonging to the exposition.  Further, Mr. Rosewater said, the contract had never been before the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kountze said the executive committee was censurable for not having the whole transaction before it before allowing any claims on the alleged contract.</p>
                            <p>This charge was discussed by the committee and then it was stated that the charge relating to the change in the ground plan of the bluff tract having been dismissed, this completed the whole matter.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Geraldine protested against allowing this charge to be dismissed as it had been preferred and made public and he insisted on having a hearing on it.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater said that he was satisfied to have the thing continued and said he was ready to file a large number of additional charges at once and produce evidence to support them.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bidwell took the position that the committee had been appointed to investigate the charges heretofore preferred and not to hear testimony on any other charges.</p>
                            <p>The investigating committee held a short consultation and decided that it had heard enough.  It was stated that it might be found necessary to await the return of President Wattles, who is in Nashville, as his name had been mentioned during the hearing, and if this was done the findings of the committee would be delayed until some time next week.  The special committee will meet at exposition headquarters at 4 o'clock this afternoon to consider the evidence.</p>

                            <p>First, Contact for Sheet Piling&#8212;On July 24 bids on this work were opened by me in the office of grounds and buildings in the presence of Manager Kirkendall, Chief Clerk Templeton and others.  Bids were as follows, originals herewith submitted:</p>

                            <p>The bids being considered too high by Manager Kirkendall and myself, were all rejected on his recommendation by the executive committee, and as it was desired to do the work by contract if possible I was instructed to confer with the lowest bidders and ascertain if a lower price might not be obtained.  After a careful revision of the specifications and consulting with good authorities I decided to modify the specifications as shown in the contract with Creedon &amp; Mahoney, copy of which is hereto attached.  The principal changes being to sink a ditch one foot and drive six inches instead of driving two feet six inches.  I also decided to set the anchor piles from twenty to thirty feet back from the main stay piles instead of ten to sixteen feet, as shown in the drawings, and I also changed the connection of these piles from stringers to galvanized wire cables, as shown.  I then called in the two lowest bidders and asked them to submit new propositions.  I suggested that both submit propositions to do the work and furnish no material, and also to do the work and furnish all materials or a portion of materials, and as they seemed to figure high on the furnishing and driving of anchor piles I suggested that they might leave that portion of the work out or give figures on it separately, my object being to get as much of the work under contract as the contractors might be willing to do at a reasonable figures or to give to each contractor such portion of the work as he could do to best advantage.  For this reason I also called in A. A. Raymond, the third bidder, as I understood he was a practical pile driver, and asked him to make a figure on such portion of the work as he could handle to best advantage.  He made a figure of 5 cents per foot on the anchor piling and 30 cents each for driving the sheet piling two and a half feet, or 20 cents each for the sheet piling on the modified proposition.</p>
                            <p>The same explanation was given both Connolly and Mr. Creedon; the same changes shown in all respects.  If there was any preference shown in all respects.  If there was any preference shown it was in favor of Connolly, who was the lowest bidder.  As you are aware it is the custom in such cases to give the lowest bidder the preference on rejected bids.  Both men were total strangers to me.  They turned in the propositions herewith submitted, which are as follows:</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">PROPOSITIONS SUBMITTED.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Connolly offers to do the work for $7,800, refusing to deduct more than $100 from the original bid because of the changes suggested.  He adds that if he is allowed to set the piling in trenches without driving he will deduct $700.  As we required the sheet piling to be driven at least six inches this deduction could not be considered, which placed the lowest proposition I was able to obtain from Connolly at $7,800.  Creedon &amp; Mahoney offered to do all the work and furnish the material, exclusive of main stay piles and anchor piles, and work on the same, for $5,936.50.  I estimated the cost of piling as between $700 and $800, as per my original entry on the bid of Creedon &amp; Mahoney hereto attached.  The actual cost of piling done by the exposition company amounted to $779.93, as per itemized statement hereto attached, which is a copy from the books of this department, making the total cost of this work $6,716.43, or $1,083.57 less than Mr. Connolly's final proposition, a saving to the exposition of over $1,000.</p>
                            <p>At the time of advertising for bids, or about July 15, I also asked several local lumbermen to make us a figure on the lumber for sheet piling, and the propositions I received are hereto attached.  On the day bids were opened and found to be too high I explained to Mr. Kirkendall that the work of sheet piling should be done as soon as possible, and as there was a prospect of further delay in letting the contract I suggested that we order the sheet piling, for the reason I wished to have it carefully selected and thoroughly dried, tongued and grooved on a special design, which I would furnish, and all this would require considerable time.  It was better therefore to order the lumber at once, and if we afterward let the work by contract to turn the order over to the contractor.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kirkendall told me to go ahead with such arrangement, and he would bring the matter before the executive committee immediately, which he did and received authority for purchase.</p>
                            <p>Prior to this all question of using white pine for sheet piling had disappeared from our calculations for the following reasons: An examination of stock in the Omaha lumber yards and conference with lumbermen convinced me that white pine, suitable for this work, could not be obtained except by special order, which would take perhaps sixty days to fill and at a very high price.  The white pine on which contractors were evidently figuring and which lumbermen proposed to furnish would not serve the purpose.  By reference to the attached written proposals of local lumbermen you will observe that the prices given on white and yellow pine of the kind and dimensions required are very nearly the same.  The lumber for sheet piling which we ordered
                            
                            <pb n="60" xml:id="TMISB03-060"/>
                            
                            from the Cady Lumber company was under the following specifications: Carefully selected in timber so to grade No. 1 select, sawed three and a quarter inches thick so to dress down to scant three inches.  (The ordinary three-inch plank would dress scant two and three-quarter inches thick), thoroughly dried by steam.  Shipments to begin within two weeks.  Because of these specifications I agreed to pay a higher price of $1 per 1,000 than would otherwise have been required.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">E. ROSEWATER PRESENT.</head>
                            <p>After I received Creedon &amp; Mahoney's last proposition, I asked Mr. Creedon what price he had figured on sheet piling (he not knowing that I had ordered the material), and he named a price 50 cents per 1,000 less than I had agreed to pay, and insisted that he could secure suitable lumber at that price if given time enough to get it here.  I then showed Mr. Creedon the bill of lumber I had made out and ordered, which he agreed to accept after I had explained the specifications.  I then sent the new proposition with the changes in specifications, etc., to the executive committee through the proper channel.  I was called before the committee, explained the work, the changes, the drawings, the specifications, etc., and in my presence the committee voted unanimously to award the contract to Creedon &amp; Mahoney in accordance with their proposition, and instructed me to drive the main stay and anchor piling ourselves.  E. Rosewater was present.</p>
                            <p>Referring in detail to the charges made, I note the following: It is stated that Mr. Connolly was asked to dig the ditch two feet deep and drive the piling six inches.  This is an error.</p>
                            <p>It is stated that Mr. Connolly submitted a bid of $2,100 for the labor alone and $7,100 for the entire contract.  A reference to Mr. Connolly's propositions hereto attached will show the falsity of this statement.</p>
                            <p>It is stated that under the revised plan, upon which Creedon &amp; Mahoney did the work, 60,000 feet of lumber was saved.  This is untrue also.  The change of back stays from timber to wire cables eliminated the stringers, amounting to about 16,000 feet, but substituted the cables, and both contractors figured on this in their revised propositions.  I believe the cost in using cables is more than the use of timbers and bolts, remembering that the distance, doubled in the revising plan, made double the amount of ditching and refilling.  The wire had to be spun into cables and spliced back at both ends, then twisted with turning rod to take up slack.  The change in sheet piling from a depth of two and one-half feet to one and one-half feet shows the apparent saving of nearly 15,000 feet, but the fact is, the lumber was ordered on the original measurement, and as a result the one foot eliminated was partly sawed to waste and partly driven to a greater depth.  An examination will show that a large portion of the sheet piling penetrates two and one-half feet and more instead of eighteen inches.  Hence, the contractor would make little if any saving in lumber on this change.  It is stated that Creedon &amp; Mahoney were relieved of an expense of $200 on iron work.  This statement is also untrue.  The only iron work shown in original plans was for the back stays which we eliminated by the substitution of cables as before explained, and the lag screws for fastening waleing to main stay piles as shown in original drawings when it was designed to put the waleing on the front side of the sheet piling.  In the Creedon &amp; Mahoney contract you will observe that we reserve the right to place this waleing back of the sheet piling, and the contractor agreed to make no additional charge.  This change was made and involved an extra expense to the contractor of at least $200 instead of relieving him of $200 as stated.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SHOWS FOR ITSELF.</head>
                            <p>It is stated that yellow pine of second quality was substituted for white pine of first quality, making a difference of $4 per 1,000.  As before stated, a reference to bids of lumbermen hereto attached will show that the greatest difference made by any lumberman was 50 cents per 1,000 between yellow pine and white pine of the quality called for.  The statement that second quality yellow pine was used is untrue.  The sheet piling furnished is the finest lot of lumber I have handled for years.  It speaks for itself; any one can examine it.</p>
                            <p>It is stated that Creedon &amp; Mahoney were given a donation of $250 by turning over our order for lumber to them.  This has been above explained; the statement is incorrect.</p>
                            <p>It is stated that a credit should be taken from the contractor for the omission of cement.  I specified in contract that cement might be required if necessary.  This was to provide against conditions which might be found where cement would be preferable; viz: sections or stratums of decomposed or porus material.  Fortunately no such conditions were found in all the work; the clay thoroughly puddled and tamped, as was done, made a much better joint with the piling than could have been made with the use of cement.  In any event, the extreme limit contemplated in the use of cement would not have exceeded $30 in value.  The width of the ditch under the specifications would have been but two inches after the plank was put in.  It was actually dug on an average of eight inches to a foot in width outside the sheet piling and thoroughly puddled and tamped to a perfect joint.</p>
                            <p>The labor of so doing exceeds in expense the use of cement as was specified.  A reference to the specifications will show that no greater or less expense was contemplated in the reference to cement.</p>
                            <p>All this was explained by me to the committee before the award of contract, and E. Rosewater was present.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">NO SPECIFICATIONS.</head>
                            <p>It is stated that the contract is still unfinished, though fully paid.  This statement is also untrue.  Reference is doubtless made to the east end of the canal, where the finishing of terraces and back walls, the putting in of platforms, steps, etc., is not done.  This work was not contemplated in any of the drawings and specifications and was not included in the contract with Creedon &amp; Mahoney.  In fact, it has never been designed, and the supervising architects have not yet recommended how it should be finished, though the greater part of it will doubtless be done in cement and concrete.  The piles which are driven to support the back walls behind steps were put in by the exposition and the waleing and coping thereon were also furnished by the exposition, but the work of anchoring and putting on the coping was done by Creedon &amp; Mahoney without extra charge, or rather as an offset to some of my charges against them.</p>
                            <p>Second, Employment of Mr. Tamm&#8212;On or about August 12 it became necessary to put in a superintendent of construction upon the work.  A superintendent had been detailed from the architect's office to superintend the work on the administration building and the manufactures building.  This man suddenly left us without notice, and the conditions required the immediate care of a competent constructionist, it being impossible for me to look after the details, the more important affairs of the department taking all my time.</p>
                            <p>At this time I learned that the services of W. H. Tamm could be secured, he having finished work for Arthur Johnson &amp; Bro. of Omaha.  I sent for Mr. Tamm and secured his agreement to work for $4 per day, although he had been accustomed to receiving a much higher salary.  I conferred on the matter with President Wattles, who was acting manager of grounds and buildings department in the absence of Mr. Kirkendall.  Mr. Wattles assented and said that he would bring the matter before the committee at the next meeting.  I at once placed Mr. Tamm on the work.  Not from any desire or intention to ignore the committee, but from the pressing necessities of the case.  Afterward Mr. Wattles told me that the committee would like to know more of Mr. Tamm; also if I could not use Mr. Daley instead of Mr. Tamm.  I explained that the work required a technical man of training and experience, very different from that of Mr. Daley.  I also procured from Mr. Tamm a statement of his experience, which I wrote down and handed to Mr. Wattles.  Later he returned it and it is herewith attached.  Observe, it bears date of August 21.  I positively assert this matter was presented to the executive committee prior to the date of this memoranda and not as stated, August 27, for the first time.  Had I waited until after August 27 subsequent events have shown that it would have cost more than two months' salary for Mr. Tamm would amount to.  Mr. Tamm was employed at $4 per day, the lowest figures at which he would consent to enter our employ.  I may have stated to Mr. Wattles that Tamm's salary would be about $100 per month; as there are on average twenty-six working days in a month, his salary would not exceed $104 per month.  There were only twenty-six working days in August and not twenty-eight, as stated.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Tamm is designated as superintendent of construction because it is his proper title.  And if anyone doubts his competency let him try, through contractors or otherwise, to have drawings or specifications evaded or any improper construction done on the grounds.  I was not employed as superintendent of construction and the title does not apply to me.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">DALEY'S CONTRACT.</head>
                            <p>Third, Daley's Contract&#8212;The contract was properly awarded Daley.  He states that Daley had been previously employed at $5 per day.  This statement is misleading.  Mr. Daley was employed to take charge of the sewer building done by the exposition as both foreman and superintendent, and for his service he received only $3 per day.  He also furnished tools for a gang of nearly fifty men, derrick and other appliances; also a horse and wagon, and for this he received $2 per day, making $5.  This fact appears on all pay rolls where Daley drew $5 per day, and was well known to all interested.  I have personally explained it to the committee.</p>
                            <p>He states that this contract was let without plans or specifications.  This statement is untrue.  No bond was asked because unnecessary.  The job was a small one, requiring only two weeks.  Mr. Daley asked no estimates; no obligation on part of the exposition until his contract should be entirely completed and accepted, and his work was thoroughly and skillfully done.  I afterward employed Daley to superintend the sheet piling work, and was very glad to get him, owing to much trouble in my efforts to get the work properly done.  Mr. Rosewater states that while "pretending to act as inspector, Mr. Daley was raking shavings on the bottom of the lagoon which work was said to have been done by contractor."  This statement is untrue, misleading and malicious.  Mr. Daley, while supervising the work or waiting the arrival of lumber (the delay of which caused frequent stoppages) busied himself in throwing out of the canal chips and pile heads left there by our own men who finished the stay piles and for which the contractor was not responsible.</p>
                            <p>Fourth, Changing Landscape Plans&#8212;The supplementary plan of the bluff tract, drawn by Mr. Ulrich, was designed at a time when more money was expected for landscape work than is now in sight.  And as a measure of economy, I have been obliged to modify his plans with the full consent of Mr. Kirkendall; also Mr. Wattles, while he filled Mr. Kirkendall's place, and the supervising architects have approved the changes suggested.  When they are completed they will be presented for approval to the executive committee.  I have not expected to improve on Mr. Ulrich's work, for I consider him the ablest landscape architect in the world, but at the time his plan was designed no buildings were located on the bluff tract and his work could only be speculative or suggestive.  His plan contemplated more than four times as many buildings as we now expect to materialize in state buildings, etc.</p>
                            <p>On his last visit here, Mr. Ulrich extended his acquaintance somewhat.  As a result, he expressed to me his belief that any man who undertook important work for this exposition would be subject to malicious persecution and annoyances if he failed to pander to selfish local interests.  Mr. Ulrich regretted that he came here, and intimated his desire to withdraw.  Finally, August 7, he wrote to me his final resignation, which is hereto attached.  I did not make this public, knowing that the withdrawal of a man like Mr. Ulrich would hurt the exposition.  I hoped to persuade Mr. Ulrich to reconsider.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater states that I employed two men on this work of changing landscape plans.  This is untrue.  The changes have been made by Mr. Arts, who made the original plan for Mr. Ulrich.  The two men who have been employed have been engaged on the floor plans of buildings and water service and on the plans of power plant, boilers, engines, railroads, electric, location of new buildings and changes of buildings.  As to whether I am at fault in this matter, I respectfully refer to Manager Kirkendall and President Wattles.</p>
                            <p>Fifth, the Planing Mill&#8212;I knew nothing of the location of a planing mill near the grounds until the building appeared above the fence.  I then found that a building permit had been granted some time before.  Vogle Bros., who erected the mill, applied to the exposition for the privilege of erecting a mill on exposition grounds and the executive committee declined their proposition.  Since which time I heard nothing of them nor from them until this building appeared.  The gate on Seventeenth street alley back of the power plant site is a permanent one, the location of which was designated in April.  However, had there been no regular gate in that vicinity, I should certainly put one in temporarily for the convenience of our contractors in reaching the mill.</p>
                            <p>As to the charge of negligence in permitting this mill to be erected: Has the city of Omaha been instructed to consult me before issuing its building permits?  Am I expected to control the city in such matters, or the acts of citizens outside the grounds?  It is true that I tried to stop the erection of the mill immediately on discovering it, but I had no power to prevent, and only succeeded in having it made less dangerous to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>As to insurance: There will be no use for this mill when this work of construction is finished and the objections of underwriters will disappear with the shutting down of same, which Vogle Bros. assured me would be done a month before the exposition opens.</p>
                            <p>Without further comment, I ask your honorable committee to carefully and thoroughly investigate all charges, and having done so, look beyond the charges for the motives that inspired them.</p>

                            <head type="sub">QUESTIONS GERALDINE.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater asked Mr. Geraldine how many feet of lumber the exposition bought and turned over to Creedon &amp; Mahoney.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine said that the exposition contracted for about 175,000 feet, but the exposition did not pay for the lumber, Creedon &amp; Mahoney assuming the order.  The price was $14.50 per 1,000.  Besides this, the contractor had to buy about 20,000 feet more of lumber to complete the job.  So that in all about 200,000 feet of lumber were required.  In addition to this, wire for the stay cables, nails and white lead were necessary.  Geraldine said he did not know just how much lead was used.  It was put on only at the west end of the lagoon.</p>
                            <p>At this point Geraldine questioned the stenographer and found that he was employed in Rosewater's department.  He then asked leave to <choice><sic>brinng</sic><corr>bring</corr></choice> in another stenographer.  This was granted.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine, being questioned by Rosewater, said the value of the wire, the nails and the white lead was about $400.</p>
                            <p>Replying to a question from Rosewater, Geraldine stated that he had not said to Kirkendall that the exposition would save $1.50 per 1,000 in buying the lumber for the lagoon.  He explained that it was urgent to get the lumber soon, of the quality described, and that while the price was $1 more per 1,000, he thought it would be cheaper for the exposition to get it then than after it was called for in the specifications.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine said the sheet piling was to dress scant three inches.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">MULHALL'S TESTIMONY.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Mulhall, for many years employed in the lumber yards of the city, was brought in by Rosewater.  Mulhall produced a specimen of the piling, showing that it was two and three-quarter inches thick, instead of three and one-quarter inches.  He said that the piling was too dry to best serve the purpose to which it was put.  He said the lumber was not even No. 2.  It was low grade lumber.  Much of the piling was knotty, and when it dried further the knots were liable to fall out.</p>
                         <p>Responding to a question, he said the life of the piling in the water would not be more than two and one-half years.  It was not a quality of lumber normally used in water.</p>
                            <p>Answering Mr. Kountze, Mulhall said he had not had much experience in using lumber of this character, and none whatever in the use of it in water.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine repeated what he had said to the effect that the lumber bought was of the first quality, and he suggested that if there was any doubt about it a competent man should be sent out to see.  With regard to the thickness of the lumber, Geraldine suggested that the specimen might be thinner on account of planing and to shrinkage due to stream and sun drying.  He said yellow pine of the kind secured would last in the water from six to ten years.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield, as an expert lumberman, was asked about this.  He said that three-inch lumber would come dressed two and five-eighths inches.  He differed here with Geraldine as to the degree of shrinkage.  He thought the life of this lumber in water would be twelve years.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater quoted the specification requiring white lead in the tongueing and grooving, and asked Geraldine how extensively white lead had been used.  The reply was about one-half.  He was asked if any reduction was made in the contract price on account of this omission, because the contractor had been subjected to delays and had done really more than the contract required.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Connolly, the unsuccessful bidder, was then called.  He described his transactions with Geraldine regarding the bids.  He said in making his second bid
                            
                            <pb n="61" xml:id="TMISB03-061"/>
                            
                            he bid on the first specifications, except in the one particular of the change in the sinking of the piling, trenching two feet and driving six inches, instead of driving two feet six inches.  He knew nothing about any other changes.  He agreed to knock off $700 if allowed to trench two feet and drive six inches.</p>
                            <p>Kountze showed him that his bid had it in black and white that this reduction contemplated merely setting the piles in the trench, without any driving.</p>
                            <p>Connolly said that thought the bid might be that way, driving was contemplated.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">QUITE A REDUCTION.</head>
                            <p>Questioned by Rosewater, Connolly figured a moment to ascertain how much of a reduction in his bid he would have made if he had been acquainted with the changes, as Creedon &amp; Mahoney appeared to have been, <choice><sic>sill</sic><corr>still</corr></choice> using white pine.  He would have been glad to reduce as much as $18 on every 1,000 feet he alleged that was wasted, that it, 60,000 feet, or $1,080.  He said he proposed to use the best quality of white pine, which could not be bought for less than $18 per 1,000.</p>
                            <p>He could have done the job at a reduction of $3.50 per thousand on all the lumber he expected to use had he known he could get the lumber at $14.50 per thousand.</p>
                            <p>Questioned by Bidwell, he said he had no bid from Hoagland or the Chicago Lumber company.  Hoagland, it was shown, had offered white pine, tongued and grooved, at $14.50 per thousand and yellow pine at $13.50.  Connolly had his bid from Hoagland and said several other lumbermen quoted about the same figure, but none of the lumbermen would guarantee to deliver at a certain speedy date yellow pine lumber.  Connolly was asked what difference he would make between white and yellow pine.  He thought about $3.  He was asked how he would explain these bids from Hoagland and the Chicago lumber company, wherein the difference was shown to be only $1.  He said he could not explain it.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater asked why Geraldine did not let Connolly know that he could get the lumber from the exposition at $14.50.  The question was not directly answered.</p>
                            <p>Wells asked Geraldine if he had asked Connolly what figures he was getting on lumber.  Geraldine said he had and Connolly had answered $13 or $14.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">DENIED THE STATEMENT.</head>
                            <p>Connolly broke in when this statement was made to say that it was absolutely false.  He said he told Geraldine $18.</p>
                            <p>In response to the questions by Rosewater Geraldine said that he had computed that the exposition furnishing the material and accepting the bid of Connolly for labor the job could be done $700 or $800 cheaper than by giving the contract to Creedon &amp; Mahoney.  He still thought Creedon &amp; Mahoney's bid too high.  He told President Wattles so, but the latter said that $700 or $800 was only a fair profit for a contractor anyway; that a great deal of kicking was being done because more work was not being done on contract after bidding, and that therefore, in order to have as much work done by contract as possible, they better let the job go to Creedon &amp; Mahoney.</p>
                            <p>The charge regarding Tamm's employment was at this point taken up.  Geraldine supplemented his written statement by saying that the inspector who had disappeared had done some improper work; there were certain disputes with contractors and the necessity of having an instructor was imperative.  He therefore sent for Tamm.  He explained the situation to Mr. Wattles.  The latter told him to go ahead and the matter would be placed before the executive committee.  The next morning Tamm was set to work.</p>
                            <p>Kountze asked why Tamm was kept in employment after the executive committee had declined to authorize the employment.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">OFFICIAL TITLE.</head>
                            <p>Geraldine said that he had informed Acting Manager Wattles that Tamm was at work and he received no order to discharge him.  In the course of the questioning about this Rosewater asked Geraldine why he designated Tamm as superintendent of construction.  Geraldine said that he so designated him because that was the position he was put in.</p>
                            <p>"What, then, are you?" Rosewater inquired.</p>
                            <p>"I was employed," Geraldine replied, "as general superintendent of the grounds and buildings department."</p>
                            <p>Rosewater stated that the records showed that Geraldine had been employed as superintendent of construction.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the Daley sewer job Geraldine said it was so small a job that he did not think a formal, written contract necessary and for the further reason that Daley asked for no obligation on the part of the exposition until after his work should be done and accepted.  It was shown that the written order to Daley was signed by manager, per Dion Geraldine, superintendent, and by G. W. Wattles as president.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater presented the order and the specifications and protested that such a job should not have been awarded without a contract.</p>
                            <p>Kountze asked it the omission was not the fault of the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater said the committee knew nothing about it.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">BLAMES THE COMMITTEE.</head>
                            <p>Kountze said that as a business proposition he believed the executive committee was censurable for paying for the work, no contract having been entered into.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater had Wednesday night withdrawn the charge about changing ground plans.</p>
                            <p>Last evening Geraldine objected to this.  He said the charge had been made and printed and he wanted to answer it.</p>
                            <p>"All right," said Rosewater, "I'll let it stand and make some more charges tomorrow and this committee can go into them."  Turning to Geraldine he said: "And that will give you a chance to sit here a few days longer at $18 per day."</p>
                            <p>The members of the committee expressed the view that they could not properly hear, under the resolution for their appointment, any additional charges that might be filed.</p>
                            <p>Kirkendall said he hoped that it could be arranged so that the committee could hear additional charges, since his department was involved and he was anxious that there be a general clearing up.</p>
                            <p>The committee intimated that it might want to interrogate President Wattles and in that case it could not come to a decision until after the president returned from Nashville, which would probably be next Monday or Tuesday.</p>
                            <p>At 6:30 the committee adjourned.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition held a short session at noon today at the Commercial club rooms and adjourned until tomorrow noon, as some of the members were unable to remain for the transaction of business.</p>
                            <p>Nothing except routine business was transacted, the only incident occurring during the meeting being the introduction of at bird'seye view of the exposition grounds drawn by A. J. Austen, an artist representing an eastern publishing house.  The view depicted the appearance of the grounds as seen from an elevated point southeast of the bluff tract, showing the entire grounds in a most realistic manner, with all the details of the buildings and the many other attractions.  The picture was pronounced most satisfactory and realistic by the members of the committee.</p>
                            <p>The work was done under the direction of the Department of Publicity, authority haveing been granted Manager Rosewater several weeks ago to have such a drawing made.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Piling that Contractors Have Been Waiting For Comes and Rapidly Being Put in Place&#8212;Condition of Lagoon.</head>
                            <p>Work on the main buildings of the exposition is progressing in a satisfactory manner, although there are a number of vexatious delays in some parts of the work, caused by delay in the shipment of material.  On the whole, fair progress is being made.</p>
                            <p>The Manufactures building is going ahead after a delay caused by failure to get material.  The long posts for the sides of the building have been received and the entire front of the structure has been raised.  A very fair idea of the height and other dimensions of the building may now be obtained, as the central dome is far enough along to denote its general appearance.  The material for the floor has arrived and is being put in place.</p>
                            <p>The Mines building is delayed by the nonarrival of the long posts.  Goldie &amp; Sons, the contractors, were notified this morning that eight cars of these posts were tied up in a wreck within ten miles of Omaha and would probably reach this city tonight.  The floor of this building is finished and work has stopped completely to await the arrival of the posts.  It has been found necessary to remove the planing mill and other machinery for turning out material to a separate building, which is being erected back of the Mines building.  This was required by the insurance men, who refused to issue a policy on the building if the machinery, engines, etc., were installed inside the building as intended by the contractor.  A temporary workshop had been constructed in the center of the floor of the Mines building and the machinery had <choice><sic>beeen</sic><corr>been</corr></choice> partially installed, but when this decision was announced all this work was taken away and a workshop is being erected several feet from the building.  All the material except the long posts is on the ground.</p>
                            <p>About one-half of the piles for the Machinery building are driven and nearly all are dressed to the proper level and the sills put in place.  Another delay has been caused by the remainder of the piles not being on hand.  The pile driver was compelled to stop work this morning.</p>
                            <p>Five hundred piles for the Agriculture building have been received and the pile driver started to work on them this morning.  The contractor anticipates that the remainder of the piles will be on the ground before those now on hand are driven.  All of the material needed for the first floor of this building is now on the track in the exposition grounds and the rest of the material is on the road.</p>
                            <p>Eight cars of lumber for the Liberal Arts building are on the exposition tracks and the piles are said to be coming down the Missouri river.  Contractor Parrish expects to start work on this building early next week.</p>
                            <p>The pipe for the water mains is strung all about the grounds and several carloads of pipe are standing on the tracks.</p>
                            <p>The lagoon is filling slowly, the water at the upper end being nearly one foot in depth.</p>

He is highly recommended by electrical authorities as an expert of exceptional ability.  Mr. Steringer expresses himself as exceedingly well pleased with the opportunity for elaborate electrical displays offered by the arrangement of the exposition grounds.  He says that the arrangement of the main court especially will afford an opportunity for an electrical display which will eclipse anything ever before attempted in that direction.  He has not yet perfected any plan for the lighting of the grounds and says he is not prepared to make public any suggestions in this direction.</p>

                            <p>Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds has had several conferences with florists of this vicinity regarding the propagation of plants which will be required for the beautifying of the exposition grounds.  An immense number of potted plants of the more ordinary varieties will be required and also a large number of the better varieties.  An investigation is being made under Manager Kirkendall's direction with a view to determining whether it will be best to contract with florists to propagate these plants and deliver them on the grounds as required, or whether the department should erect temporary greenhouses and do the work.  Overtures have been made to the park board to cooperate <choice><sic>witht he</sic><corr>with the</corr></choice> department in erecting greenhouses for this purpose.</p>

                            <head type="sub">His Decapitation Will Give General Satisfaction, and Confidence In the Enterprise Will Be Restored.</head>
                            <head type="sub">He Shows Himself to Be An Impudent, Arrogant, Bulldozing Bluffer While on the Stand.</head>
                            <head type="sub">"The Western Laborer's" Exposures Confirmed--The Bonds Have Some Show for Success Now.</head>
                            <p>Readers of the Omaha Bee who have read the charges of incompetency, gross negligence, favoritism and general crookedness with which its editor charged Dion Geraldine can now see that there was much fire where THE WESTERN LABORER saw the smoke four months ago.</p>
                            <p>The result of the investigation wherein every charge of Mr. Rosewater is proven (most of them on Geraldine's own admissions) is evidence that we know what we were talking about all the time when we charged the management with neglect and the superintendent of grounds and buildings with incompetency and waste of public money, to say the least about it.</p>
                            <p>People ask, now that Geraldine is convicted, what will the directory do?</p>
                            <p>We hope the directory will do its duty to the stock subscribers and the public just as they would act if the exposition work was <choice><sic>there</sic><corr>their</corr></choice> own private business, and we will not venture to say there is not a man on the board who, if he had hired a foreman or superintendent to look after his interests and he did it as Geraldine has handled the exposition work, would have kept him a minute in charge after such a discovery.</p>
                            <p>We have no suggestion to make to make to the directory with regard to Geraldine, the "czar of Jackson park," seeing that one of its members pooh poohed our charges as ONLY coming from THE WESTERN LABORER, and was only street talk.</p>
                            <p>It was street talk that demanded the investigation which has been held, and the result fully warranted the demand.</p>
                            <p>We now ask these smart business men if they think a directory of workingmen would have let Geraldine and his "friends" bunco them all these months?&#8212;buy material on his order, turn it over to a contractor and have the exposition pay for it, and then be satisfied when told, "yes; Wattles and I talked about it;" "I mentioned it to Wattles and he didn't object."  We innocently ask, could Geraldine do anything to which Wattles would object?</p>
                            <p>We ask these "business men," has the management of the exposition conducted the work on business methods which meets with their approval, or would they conduct their own business as they have conducted the public business of permitted it to be conducted?  We would expect them to say, "no! decidedly no! not by a d&#8212;n sight!"  Why, then, has Geraldine been permitted to do these things so long?</p>
                            <p>The public trusted the directory because of their supposed business experience, executive ability, honesty and social standing.  In fact there was a scramble to get on the directory.  What was this scramble for?  Was it to become the dupes of Geraldine, the "czar of Jackson park," and a few designing men and to present the public with the conditions of things that now exist?</p>
                            <p>THE WESTERN LABORER believes "the half has never yet been told" and that double the number of charges could be made, but the trial committee say they "have heard enough."</p>
                            <p>We think so too, else we would tell them of their "splendid" sewer system, where a gang of men open hole after hole (60 feet long in one instance) in search of a Y connection and finding none decide to break the main pipe and put in a Y to make a connection.  How could the men find connections that didn't exist?  or how would a ground plan and specifications made and filed after the pipe was laid and the ditch filled indicate connections if none were there and the contractor couldn't point them out?  But the work is all paid for and accepted and that is "business!"</p>
                            <p>The public owes Mr. Rosewater a debt of gratitude for his tearing down the blinds on this rascality instead of hushing it up.</p>
                            <p>Some have tried to ignore the public clamor, but the public will not be ignored, nor THE WESTERN LABORER pooh poohed.  We were sure we were right.  We went ahead for four months, and now what a damnable showing Rosewater has unearthed!</p>
                            <p>We don't think it <choice><sic>necessarry</sic><corr>necessary</corr></choice> to send another Diogenes into the <unclear/> with a lantern in search of an honest man, though the state fair management would almost tempt us to do so.</p>
                            <p>There are honest men on the directory and we appeal to them to act with the subscriptions of the people given during these hard times as if it was their own, and do the best they can with it.</p>
                            <p>We all want the exposition to be a grand success, but something must be done to restore public confidence in the management or it is sure to be a failure.</p>
                            <p>We hold in our hands specifications of plants required by the grounds and buildings department which displays the usual idiocy.  The specifications call for 100,000 plants.  Assuming the estimate to be enough&#8212;which it is not by a long way&#8212;does any sane man think that a florist can enter into a contract furnishing a bond in double the amount of the accepted contract, raise the required number of plants and risk having them remain on his hands should the exposition be postponed another year from any unforeseen cause?  What security has the florist from the superintendent of grounds and buildings who exacts double bonds from the florists?  Then assuming that a florist accepts the risk he is bound to deliver the stock of plants on the exposition grounds between April 15 and  May 24 "in pots" (to be returned to the bidders).  The transplanting of these plants from the pots to their beds is to be a work of magic, as the exposition opens in June, and would give the plants about six days to take root and bloom in order to delight the eye of the visitors.</p>
                            <p>Verily, Geraldine's knowledge of horticulture is transcendent and does him as much honor as his knowledge of architecture and engineering.</p>
                            <p>Bah! fire him!</p>

                            <head type="main">DEMANDS OF UNION LABOR</head>
                            <head type="sub">EXPOSITION WORKMEN OUT ON A STRIKE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Charge Made that Geraldine Brought in Scab Labor from the East to Break the Back of the Union.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The labor troubles which have followed Dion Geraldine's connection with the exposition culminated this morning in an open strike.  All the men employed on the grounds who belong to labor organizations laid down their tools and the erection of the buildings in the main court is at a standstill.  The carpenters and the staff workers all quit, except a few men employed by the Hamilton Bros. on the Machinery building, and a conference was appointed with them at noon.</p>
                            <p>Representatives of the labor unions charge Dion Geraldine with being directly responsible for this condition of affairs.  They say that he has brought outside labor in to Omaha and has flooded the east with reports
                            
                            <pb n="63" xml:id="TMISB03-063"/>
                            
                            that there are not enough carpenters, plasterers, painters and men of various other building trades in Omaha to do the work needed on the exposition, and that this has resulted in bringing into Omaha hundreds of men who are taking the work directly out of the hands of men who live in Omaha and have their families here, many of whom own property in the city.  These men say there is no truth in the reports sent out by Geraldine to eastern contractors and trade journals, and that he had been actuated solely by a desire to "break the back of organized labor."  They also say that Geraldine is directly responsible for the actions of the contractors in refusing to treat with representatives of organized labor.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">DEMANDS OF LABOR.</head>
                            <p>At the last meeting of the Building Trades council a resolution was adopted demanding that organized labor be recognized by the exposition management and that none but union labor be employed on the grounds.  This resolution was prefaced by numerous "whereases," reciting that all former efforts to secure recognition had failed; that scab labor from the outside had been brought into the city to take the work away from Omaha men; that a proposition to vote $100,000 of county bonds in aid of the exposition is about to be presented to the voters of Douglas county.  The demand for recognition was followed by a resolution declaring that all the allied trades represented in the Building Trades council would do all in their power to defeat the bond proposition unless accorded recognition on the exposition work.</p>
                            <p>The adoption of this resolution was followed by a meeting of representatives of all the building trades' organization at Labor Temple yesterday afternoon, at which it was decided to inaugurate a strike on the exposition grounds.  At this meeting the attitude of Geraldine came in for censure.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">STRIKE IS ORDERED.</head>
                            <p>This morning the strike order took effect, and at the hour of commencing work the carpenters and staff men laid down their tools and walked out.  The men demand that eight hours shall constitute a day's work; that carpenters shall receive 30 cents per hour, and that none but union men shall be employed.  The men say that the contractors have been paying carpenters but 20 or 25 cents per hour and that they have been hiring laborers to do carpenters' work, such as laying floors, etc., and have been requiring all men to work nine or ten hours.  All of the men employed on the Manufactures building walked out and absolutely nothing is being done about the building.  The few carpenters working on the Administration building walked out and two or three lathers and one or two men employed in putting on the roofing material are all that are working about the building.  The big Mines building was deserted, not a man being at work on it; a few men were engaged in setting up the boiler for the planing mill to be operated by Contractor Goldie for this building.  The Machinery building was the only one where any work was being done, a force of fifteen men being at work.  Of this number four or five were union men and a conference was agreed on between the union representatives and all of the men employed.</p>

                            <head type="sub">VIEWS OF CONTRACTORS.</head>
                            <p>Contractor Hamilton of the Mines building said he intended to go ahead regardless of what the union did.  He said he was under bonds to complete the building at a certain time and would employ non-union labor if necessary.  He said he was paying from 25 to 30 cents per hour, according to a man's ability, averaging about 28 cents per hour, and working ten hours a day.  He also stated that the union would only allow one laborer to five carpenters and he said he could work a larger per centage of laborers to advantage.</p>
                            <p>Contractor Goldie said he intended to be governed by what the local contractors do in the matter.  He said he was delayed by the failure of some of his long timber to arrive and could wait a few days without any loss to himself as soon as the matter is decided.</p>
                            <p>Contractor Strehlow said he had been employing union labor all along and expected to continue doing so.</p>
                            <p>The staff workers also have a few grievances and say they will take advantage of the present strike to have a few adjustments on their account.  They complain that the staff contractors are employing green hands to do casting and other intricate portions of the staff work, paying them almost nothing and getting very inferior work.  The staff men were recently organized into a union, and they say they are going to claim the protection and co-operation of the other unions.</p>

No business of importance was transacted, the meeting being devoted to the discussion of the things which have been announced from time to time through the newspapers.

                            <p>The October number of the American School Board Journal, the official organ of the National Education association, contains on its title page a full page cartoon representing the contest between Omaha, Washington, D. C., Los Angeles and Salt Lake City for the next meeting of the association.  The school superintendents of these four cities are depicted as wise men of the desert who have followed the blazing star seen in the sky on the face of which are the magical letters "N. E. A."  Each "wise man" carries a miniature building emblematic of his city, Superintendent C. G. Pearse holding an exposition building in his right hand.  A news item in another column conveys the information that Omaha and Salt Lake City will be visited some time during the present month by the executive committee.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Sports Peculiar to Northern Climes Will Be Provided, and the Grounds Will Be Beautifully Illuminated.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The concession recently granted by the exposition management for the holding of an ice carnival on the exposition grounds during the coming winter gives promise of affording the people of Omaha and the surrounding country an opportunity for enjoying a season of winter sports which has not been possible during recent years, and it is doubtful if the oldest inhabitant can recall such a diversified entertainment as is promised by the concessionaires of the privilege just granted.</p>
                            <p>Omaha is fairly well supplied, for an inland city remote from any large body of water, with facilities for winter enjoyment, but no attempt has been made to have any extensive or organized movement involving an extended period of winter sports of all kinds.  The concessionaires of this privilege propose to furnish the one thing needful and will supply the directing hand which has been the missing link heretofore.</p>
                            <p>The winter carnival will be held on the lagoon in the main court of the exposition grounds, commencing when the weather is cold enough to supply the necessary ice, probably early in January.  By that time the buildings on the main court will be practically completed and their beauty will add very materially to the scene.  The carnival exercises will be held at night and the main court will be brilliantly lighted by electricity.  The lagoon will be filled to the top of the banks, presenting an unbroken surface of glistening ice; the ground surrounding it will be leveled off and arranged as it will appear during the exposition, furnishing a broad promenade entirely around the basin, and back of this will stand the beautiful main buildings, giving a setting to the scene that will require but little imagination to convey the impression of a winter scene in the beautiful city of St. Petersburg, where the winters are spent in continuous enjoyment of exhilarating sport on the ice and snow.</p>
                            <p>In this beautiful setting will occur a series of enjoyable events which will eclipse anything ever before attempted in this city, and which will attract to Omaha thousands of visitors from all parts of the country.  Every kind of winter sport will be in full blast and the people of all the northern nations may come and enjoy themselves in their favorite national winter sports and games.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">LONG TOBOGGAN SLIDE.</head>
                            <p>The program for this carnival, as arranged in a general way by the concessionaires, contemplates a number of features, among them being the erection of a huge toboggan slide at the east end of the main court, the summit of the chute being erected over Sherman avenue, directly east of the lagoon, with a chute of 350 feet to the ice, where there will be a slide of 1,000 feet, ending at Twentieth street.  The latest devices for insuring safety and high speed will be used in the construction of this chute and it is promised that experienced men will be employed as starters, and the risk of accident reduced to the minimum.</p>
                            <p>This one feature of the carnival will undoubtedly be sufficient to inspire a wide interest in the event, and it is not unlikely that the immense popularity of tobogganing in the extreme northern states and Canada will be duplicated in Omaha, and that toboggan clubs, with their uncouth but attractive costumes made of gaily striped blanket cloth, will be a common sight on the streets during the carnival period.  Tobogganing is one of the most favored sports in the north, but the opportunity has never been offered in this section for its enjoyment.</p>
                            <p>A ski chute will form another feature which will undoubtedly attract widespread attention, as much on account of its novelty as for the entertainment it will afford.  Ski riding is almost unknown in America, but natives of Scandinavia will see in it a constant reminder of the old country.  A ski is about eight feet long, and is used for descending long inclines much after the manner of a toboggan, the rider having ski attached to each foot.  Contests will be held between experienced riders, which will afford amusement and entertainment of a novel nature.  The ski chute will be constructed with a view of breaking the record for a long jump, which is about 104 feet.</p>
                            <p>Two or three curling rinks will be constructed, probably at the extreme west end of the ground, where there are several level pieces of ground which offer fine locations for such rinks.  On these some of the most prominent curling clubs will be brought together and a number of local cracks at curling will be given an opportunity to demonstrate that they have not lost their cunning.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">CONTESTS IN SKATING.</head>
                            <p>The portion of the lagoon lying west of Twentieth street will be devoted to a general skating rink.  This will include the broad mirror, giving altogether about 250,000 square feet of surface or about six acres.  On this broad sheet of ice will be held contests between the fast and fancy skaters of the country, and all comers will be given full swing in enjoying the exhilarating sport.</p>
                            <p>At stated intervals during the carnival bal masques will be given on the ice after the manner of the famous events which have made St. Petersburg celebrated all over the world.  The skaters will be obliged to appear in costume and the stately procession will move about on the glistening ice to the accompaniment of inspiring music.</p>
                            <p>Should the weather permit an ice palace will be erected on the island occupying the middle of the channel at the intersection of Twentieth street.  This will be brilliantly illuminated by electricity, forming a striking spectacle and adding a most beautiful feature to the gay scene all about.  Many events will be made to center about this ice palace, such as a visit of the king and queen to the royal residence and a battle royal directed against the icy walls of the stately pile.  When its usefulness has passed the palace will be burned in a blaze of brilliant fire works, affording a spectacle of great beauty, which will undoubtedly attract thousands of guests from all sections of the country.</p>

                            <p>A plan is under consideration for holding a grand winter inaugural ceremony on the exposition grounds during the carnival season.  If this plan is carried out the event will be made an important one and everything will be conducted on an elaborate scale.  The city will be appropriately decorated and an impressive program will be arranged for the ceremonies on the grounds.  Excursion rates will be made on all railroads entering Omaha, and the entire affair will be conducted on a scale which will draw spectators from the entire section surrounding Omaha.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the features heretofore mentioned there will be a number of events out of the ordinary which will be put on at different times during the progress of the carnival, such as ice bicycle races, promenades on the ice of floats after the fashion of the Ak-Sar-Ben parades which have made Omaha famous all over the country and similar events of more than passing importance.</p>
                            <p>This carnival of enjoyment will be under the direction of Norris &amp; Love, men who have had wide experience in the amusement business and who are thoroughly posted in the art of knowing what the public wants and filling that want.  These men have been connected with several expositions in furnishing amusement for the public and have been remarkably successful financially as well as from a strictly artistic standpoint.  The concession referred to is let on a basis which gives the exposition a substantial portion of the receipts, so that the affair will be in a measure a strictly exposition enterprise, and the exposition treasury will reap the benefit of the success which attends the carnival.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Present Plans of the Badger State Commission.</head>
                            <p>The organization of the Wisconsin commission for the Transmississippi Exposition has already been mentioned in The Bee, but the following account of the meeting from the Milwaukee Sentinel of October 8 gives an idea of the plans upon which the commission will work:</p>
                            <p>The Wisconsin commission for the exposition that is to be held at Omaha, Neb., from June 1 to November 1, 1898, met for the first time yesterday at the rooms of the Merchants' association, and the following named were in attendance: Ex-Mayor John C. Koch, John E. Hansen, Alfred C. Clas, Colonel J. A. Watrous, Eugene Wuesthoff and Mrs. Caroline H. Bell of Milwaukee; General E. E. Bryant and R. G. Thwaites, Madison; John Hicks, Oshkosh; W. T. Lewis, Racine; J. B. Treat, Monroe; H. D. Fisher, Florence; Mrs. Ella Roberts, Waukesha.</p>
                            <p>The commission organized by the election of John C. Koch as president, Alfred C. Clas as treasurer, and Walter W. Pollock as secretary.</p>
                            <p>On motion of H. D. Fisher of Florence it was decided that the Wisconsin commission shall use every possible effort to make a creditable exhibit of the products and resources of Wisconsin at the Omaha Exposition.  The commissioners present were thus
                            
                            <pb n="64" xml:id="TMISB03-064"/>
                            
                            afforded an opportunity to satisfy themselves as to what they should attempt to do, and the conclusion was that they should seek to interest the manufacturers and all people in the state in making as large and creditable an exhibit of their products as possible, and also to erect and maintain a Wisconsin building on the exposition grounds at Omaha.</p>
                            <p>Architect A. C. Clas offered to submit to the commission plans for a building without any charge for them, and to make the building one of the drawing features at the exposition.  The building, he said, would be 40x60 feet, of a design that would appear unique and attractive, and its interior could be so fitted up as to draw all the people visiting the exposition.  The exhibit of the Wisconsin Fish commission could be made one of the features of the interior, and fountains dispensing gratis Wisconsin delicious spring waters would add to the popularity of the building.  The picture drawn by Mr. Clas seemed very attractive, and the idea of the fish exhibit met with the approval of General Bryant, the president of the fish commission.</p>
                            <p>The outcome of the discussion was the adoption of a resolution to raise by subscription and personal solicitation $15,000 to $20,000 for the erection of the building and defraying the expenses of the Wisconsin exhibit.  A circular will be addressed to all well-to-do people in Milwaukee and the state, asking for subscriptions, and the sending out of the circular will be followed by personal solicitation.  Circulars will also be addressed to the manufacturers and producers in general, urging them to participate by sending articles of their manufacture to the exposition.  Because of the expense which these exhibits will involve, the commission will be lenient with the manufacturers, and will solicit the subscriptions for the $15,000-$20,000 fund from the people at large.</p>
                            <p>H. D. Fisher and A. C. Clas were appointed a committee to go to Omaha and select a site for the Wisconsin building, in as good a location as they can get.  They will leave within a few days for the Nebraska metropolis, and will report to the commission at its next meeting.</p>
                            <p>After discussing various exhibition plans, among them to make a school exhibit, suggested by Mrs. Caroline Bell, the commission adjourned, subject to the call of Chairman Koch.</p>

                            <p>James A. Smart, deputy minister of the interior of Ottawa, Canada, is in the city.  Before leaving he will have a conference with the Nebraska and Kansas agents of the Dominion government and prepare their work for the winter's campaign in the field of securing homeseekers.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smart expresses himself as very satisfied with the results following making an exhibit of Canada's resources at the several western state fairs, and says it is not improbable that Canada will make a big effort at the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
                            <p>The deputy minister is on his return to Ottawa from an official visit to the western provinces of the Dominion.  He reports the farmers there as having done wonderfully well this year, the wheat crop averaging about twenty-six bushels to the acre, and from 75 to 80 cents per bushel being paid for it.  The farmers there, he says, have gone largely into diversified farming and the cattle and dairy trades have developed to an extraordinary extent during the past few years.  Further, he states that the country is now pretty well intersected by railways and more are being built to provide for the needs of the rapid development that is taking place and the influx of new settlers.</p>

                            <head type="sub">CARPENTERS AND STAFF WORKERS ARE OUT</head>
                            <head type="sub">Conditions Brought on by the Strike Continue, with Few Men at Work Upon the Buildings&#8212;Carpenters Union Meets Tonight.</head>
                            <p>There was but a slight change in the situation at the exposition grounds this morning, the strike order being still in force.  Strehlow, the contractor on the Manufactures building, put a small force of men at work, consisting of about ten laborers and five carpenters, two of the latter being men who struck yesterday.  The force on the Machinery building was the same this morning as yesterday, none of the men having yielded to the arguments advanced last night by the strikers.</p>
                            <p>A large crowd of men stood about the several buildings, some few of them being strikers and the others being men apparently looking for a chance to go to work.  No attempt was made to interfere with the men who were working or to speak to them.</p>
                            <p>The long timbers which have been delaying work on the big Mines building arrived on the grounds this morning and the work of unloading them was commenced at once.  While this was being done, there were fully 100 men standing around looking on and waiting for a chance to go to work.  Contractor Goldie said he would make an attempt to start work just as soon as the material was unloaded, but didn't know whether the men would want to work or not.</p>
                            <p>The striking carpenters say that Goldie has been paying the union scale all along and working eight hours per day and that they have no complaint against him.  Goldie himself stands by his statement, that he will be guided entirely by what the local contractors do in the matter.</p>
                            <p>The staff workers are still out and the carpenters are relying on this fact to have a strong influence in forcing a settlement in their favor as they argue that it will be impossible to complete the buildings without the staff workers, and they say that the competent staff men all over the country belong to the labor organizations and that, for that reason, men can not be brought here to take the places of the strikers.</p>
                            <p>The carpenters' union will hold a regular meeting at Labor Temple tonight and the strike will form the principle matter for consideration.</p>
                            <p>A mass meeting of the representatives of the organizations in the Building Trades council, the striking workmen and a number of representatives of unions not directly concerned in the strike was held at Labor Temple yesterday afternoon.  The meeting was held behind closed doors and lasted all afternoon.  When the meeting adjourned it proceeded in a body to the exposition grounds with a view of inducing the men working for Hamilton Brothers on the Machinery building to quit work.  There were about sixty men who started for the grounds, and they walked out in small groups.</p>
                            <p>When the grounds were reached the men stood around in little knots discussing the situation, but made no attempt to interfere with the workmen.  Perfect order was preserved and the strikers made no attempt to mix with the men who were working or annoy them in any way.  They simply waited until 6 o'clock, when the men quit work for the day.  Then the strikers approached those who had been working and talked and reasoned with them, endeavoring to secure their co-operation and assistance in the controversy with the contractors.</p>

                            <p>The Woman's Board of Managers is holding a meeting at Exposition headquarters today.  There is little business of importance to be transacted.  The report of the executive committee, showing what has been done since the last meeting of the board, was laid before the board and formed the chief topic for discussion.</p>
                            <p>The special committee, consisting of Mesdames Towne and Whitney, appointed to visit the convention of Indian teachers held in Omaha during the summer, reported on observations made during the convention and this formed the subject of a desultory discussion.</p>
                            <p>The special committee of the Girls' and Boys' building, through its chairman, Mrs. T. L. Kimball, submitted a report of what had been done in Omaha in the way of raising funds for the erection of the building.  Other members of the directory reported on the work done in their districts.  All of these reports were of an encouraging nature and the movement was shown to be meeting with favor.</p>
                            <p>In connection with the work in Omaha it was reported that the executive committee had decided to appoint a patroness for each school building in the city, this patroness to have charge of the work of collecting subscriptions from the school children and to co-operate with the principals in arousing interest and enthusiasm among the children and inducing them to contribute toward the erection of the building.  It was stated that the Omaha principals would meet Thursday night of this week to take up this matter and that it would probably be arranged that a day should selected, to be known as a rally day, when the matter would be presented to the schools and subscriptions collected.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Geraldine Discloses Some More Important Information.</head>
                            <p>At the meeting of the executive committee of the exposition held yesterday afternoon at the Commercial club rooms the principal matter before the committee was a resolution introduced by Manager Rosewater designed to curtail the arbitrary authority heretofore exercised by Dion Geraldine, superintendent of construction of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, in the purchasing of large amounts of supplies and hiring of high-priced men without any authority or without the knowledge of the executive committee until the bills were received.  The resolution provided that the authority granted the department to be limited to the purchase of supplies to the extent of $50 and the employment of day laborers.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall insisted that the department had never been granted any such authority and stated that he had never failed to lay all such matters before the executive committee before taking action.  In reply to this Mr. Rosewater referred to the testimony given by Geraldine in his own defense when under investigation, in which he stated that he had understood that he had authority to buy supplies and hire men and had acted along those lines.  Mr. Kirkendall stood by his former contention, but said he would not object to the portion of the resolution referring to the employment of day laborers.</p>
                            <p>The resolution was changed to eliminate all except the portion giving the department authority to employ laborers, and after some discussion it was withdrawn entirely.</p>
                            <p>During the discussion on this matter reference was made to the written defense made by Geraldine to the charges filed against him, especially that portion of the document referring to Rudolf Ulrich, the landscape architect, where Geraldine makes answer to the charge that the ground plan of the bluff tract, as prepared by Ulrich, had been changed by Geraldine without the knowledge or consent of the executive committee.  In this statement Geraldine said that Ulrich had sent his written resignation to him (Geraldine) August 7, and he attached what purported to be Ulrich's resignation to the written defense.  Mr. Kirkendall expressed some surprise at this portion of Geraldine's statement and admitted that he had known nothing about Ulrich resigning, although Geraldine stated that he had had the resignation for over two months.</p>
                            <p>In this connection Mr. Rosewater stated that he had written to Ulrich after he learned of the alleged resignation, and he produced a telegram he had just received in reply from Ulrich, reading: "I will do your work satisfactory.  A letter follows."</p>
                            <p>The remainder of this portion of Geraldine's statement was also read to the committee, being to the effect that after Ulrich's resignation was received by Geraldine the latter came to the conclusion that the plan as drawn by Ulrich was too expensive and concluded to change it and had employed men for that purpose, stating, further, that when he had fixed it to suit him he had intended laying it before the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>The members of the executive committee were speechless after this display, and the matter was allowed to rest until the receipt of Ulrich's letter.</p>
                            <p>Manager Bruce announced the appointment of Edward Whitcomb of Friend as superintendent of the Apiary bureau.  The appointment was confirmed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater asked that the committee meet at noon today to take up the report of the special committee appointed to investigate Geraldine, provided it is ready to report, in order that action might be taken on the matter before the meeting of the Board of Directors at 4 o'clock this <choice><sic>aftednoon</sic><corr>afternoon</corr></choice>.</p>

The two entrances on Sherman avenue were each guarded by a man, who admitted no one without a pass from the Department of Buildings and Grounds.  If the applicant was persistent, he was referred to Dion Geraldine, and when he visited the office of this man in the Paxton block, he found that his passage was barred by a stout iron screen partition extending entirely across the outer office, the door through it being guarded by a clerk employed for that purpose.  All further progress was prevented and he was told that Geraldine was too busy to be interrupted.</p>
                            <p>Members of the strike committee who were on the grounds yesterday afternoon were ordered off by Contractor Hamilton, who told them he had been instructed by Manager Kirkendall to order all strikers off the ground.  The strikers left at once and made no further attempt to go inside.</p>
                            <p>The strikers state most emphatically that they have never molested any of the men employed on the grounds while they were working, but have invariably waited until the men quit before speaking to them.  They freely admit that they have talked to the men after working hours and have used every argument to induce them to join the union.  They say they intend to pursue this course regardless of whether they are debarred from going inside the grounds.  Superintendent Tamm is authority for the statement that the strikers behaved themselves in the most becoming manner and made no trouble whatever.  He says the strikers acted like men and made no attempt to molest the workingmen in any way.</p>

                            <head type="sub">State Commission Holds Back on Its Payments.</head>
                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission has not yet paid for the space for the Nebraska building, although the warrant for the money has been in Secretary Dearing's hands for some time.  The commission is trying to induce the exposition management to donate to the state a strip of ground thirty-six feet in width surrounding the State building, after securing special rates, very much below those which have been paid by all other states, the Nebraska commission asked for an amount of space which which its members knew was very much less than would be actually covered by the building without allowing for steps, buttresses, or other projections.  When the exposition management objected and suggested that more space would be required, putting the total amount several feet inside the actual measurement of the building, as shown by the plans, the state commission consented to increase the amount asked for, although no member  of the commission, architects of the State building nor the superintendent of construction employed by the state commission could figure the space down to the figures named by the exposition management.  The application was then modified by increasing the number of feet to the amount named by the exposition people and a warrant ordered drawn in payment for this amount of space.</p>
                            <p>It was after this performance that Dion Geraldine assumed the authority to tell the representatives of the state commission that the state could have all the land surrounding the State building, about five acres in all, and could embellish it as the commission saw fit, as the exposition had no use for it.</p>
                            <p>It would appear that the state commission did not place much reliance on Mr. Geraldine's ability to carry out his offer of exposition property and application was made to the management for the space about the State building, but no offer to remunerate the management in any way for this additional space.  No action has yet been taken by the exposition authorities on this demand on the part of the state commission and the warrant for the original space is being withheld.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Stieringer has been in the city about a week, studying the general plans of the exposition, the arrangement of the buildings and other things necessary to know in order to decide upon the electrical work.  He is most enthusiastic regarding the general arrangement of the exposition grounds and pronounces the effect as more artistic.  The main court is <choice><sic>especialy</sic><corr>especially</corr></choice> complimented and Mr. Stieringer says it will form a setting for electrical effects which is far superior to anything ever before furnished in any exposition.  He says he will outline plans for electrical decoration which will secure results never before attainable in any exposition for the reason that such an <choice><sic>apportunity</sic><corr>opportunity</corr></choice> for magnificent effects was never offered any electrician before.  These outline plans will be submitted for approval in a few weeks and more details can then be stated.</p>

                            <p>The striking carpenters on the exposition grounds scored victory No. 1 this morning when Contractor Strehlow capitulated and agreed to employ only union men and observe the union rules regarding working eight hours and paying 30 cents per hour to carpenters.  The strikers regard this as only one step in the right direction and their attention will next be turned to Hamilton Bros.. and Contractor Parrish, who has the Liberal Arts <choice><sic>biulding</sic><corr>building</corr></choice>.  When these men agree to the union's terms, Contractor Goldie will follow suit and the attention of the strikers will then be turned to Smith &amp; Eastman, the staff contractors.</p>
                            <p>A verbal agreement was reached with Strehlow this morning and a written agreement will be presented to him for signature.

                            <p>The victory was accomplished largely through the influence of Strehlow's foreman, Saunders, upon whom Strehlow was almost entirely dependent for the proper carrying on of the work of erecting the building.  Saunders struck with the other men and Strehlow could not carry on the work without him and was unable to replace him with any other man.  Being unable to proceed Strehlow was forced to give in.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi association will occupy its new rooms in the Grand hotel this evening for the first time, and will celebrate the event by an informal little banquet.  It will be the second of the fortnightly series of informal lunches that were suggested and heartily approved at the regular meeting held several weeks ago, but which have not been given for the reason that the committee was still in rather an unorganized condition pending the propositions to secure permanent headquarters and to incorporate under the state laws.  Both of these objections have now been removed, and the committee will tonight meet as a regularly incorporated association in its permanent headquarters.  The suggestions for frequent informal banquets and the regular mid-day lunch on Saturdays will now be followed and renewed interest in the work of the association will be the result.</p>
                            <p>The luncheon will begin at 8 o'clock sharp.  After this conclusion the members will meet in the new headquarters in the room south of the main rotunda and go into a working session.  The secretary and the officers of the association want it understood that members are not prohibited inviting interested friends either to the luncheon or the business meeting.  The only object the association has is to advance the interests of Council Bluffs in the exposition and the exposition itself, and there will not be any objection to the presence of any man who desires to aid in accomplishing the same objects.</p>

"It was simply a matter of finances," said Senator Warren.  "The people felt that they really could afford nothing at all.  I think that the hard times have been felt in Wyoming and the mountain states more severely than almost everywhere else.  It is only now that the renewed energy is felt progressing from the east.  I have spent part of the summer on my ranch and among stockmen and I have observed the attitude of Wyoming business men.  So I can say with some authority that theirs is no passive interest and it will be shown in a substantial way when the time comes."</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>At the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Transmississippi Exposition yesterday afternoon it was decided that Dion Geraldine should be retained as superintendent of construction in the Department of Buildings and Grounds in the face of open charges of corruption, collusion with contractors, juggling with contracts and general crookedness.</p>
                            <p>Following this decision on the part of the board, Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion, who had made the charges, tendered his resignation and gave notice that he would sever all connection with the exposition after Friday of this week, because he did not propose to continue as a member of the executive committee and be compelled to see the pilfering and stealing which was going on all the time and not be able to put a stop to it.</p>
                            <p>This action was taken after a session lasting nearly two hours, the greater part of which was taken up by Mr. Rosewater in reviewing the evidence which had been given before the investigating committee and in making an argument based on what was shown by this evidence.  Remarks were made on this subject by but one other member of the directory, and when the vote was taken on a resolution providing for Geraldine's immediate dismissal the secret ballot showed twenty-two votes in favor of Geraldine's retention and twelve votes in favor of his discharge.</p>
                            <p>As shown by this vote, there were thirty-four of the fifty directors present.  In the lobby was the object of all the trouble, Dion Geraldine, while Architect Kimball, John Templeton, Geraldine's clerk, and several citizens and public officials were interested spectators.</p>

                            <p>When the roll was called there were thirty-one directors present.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles said there was a report of a special committee before the board and he would ask the secretary to read it.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater raised the point that this report was addressed to the executive committee and was not properly before the board.  He said he had a resolution which he desired to introduce and he would then ask for the reading of the report.  The resolution was as follows:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the services of Dion Geraldine as superintendent of buildings and grounds be dispensed with from and after this date.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater said he had introduced almost the same resolution in the executive committee but with a different ending, providing that the discharge should be for cause.  He said he had preferred charges against Geraldine and these had been investigated by a special committee.  The report made by this committee, he said, omitted several of the most important points brought out in the investigation and if these points were not to be considered the conclusions of the committee were correct; but if these points were to be considered the conclusions were not correct, and these points would compel the adoption of the resolution.  Mr. Rosewater asked that the report be read and said he would then ask the privilege of reading some of the evidence and would comment on the salient points.</p>
                            <p>The secretary then read the report of the special committee.</p>
                            <p>At the conclusion of the reading of the report Mr. Rosewater said it might be presumptuous for him to present different conclusions from those arrived at by the eminent gentlemen composing the committee.  He said the committee had proceeded on the theory that Geraldine was indispensable to the exposition and he demanded in what particular thing Geraldine was particularly qualified.  He asked what Geraldine had done that could not have been done by any one of twenty or thirty men in Omaha.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WHO IS DOING THE WORK.</head>
                            <p>The plans for the sewers, he said, had been made by the city engineer; the plans for the water pipes by the chief engineer of the water company; the plans for piling the lagoon by a former assistant to the city engineer; the plans for the electric work would be made by a man recently employed by the executive committee for that purpose; the plans for the landscape work had been made by a landscape man of experience brought here from the east; and the plans for the buildings by the architects employed for the purpose.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater declared that the only thing that Geraldine had done was to botch around and change some of the plans made by other men.  He asserted that Geraldine had no special ability in any direction which would warrant his employment as an expert and he said he should be discharged as a measure of economy, as he was being paid $500 per month, while the management was paying another man $104 per month for doing the work Geraldine was employed to do.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater then proceeded to read copious extracts from the testimony given before the investigating committee, keeping up a running fire of comment on the points brought out.  He read a quantity of the testimony given by Geraldine, calling attention to the matter in which Geraldine contradicted himself on important points a great number of times and showing, also, how Geraldine gave the lie to the strong statements of Manager Kirkendall to the effect that Geraldine had represented that the number for the lagoon should be bought by the exposition for the reason that it could be bought for $1.50 below the market price and money could thus be saved.  The whole lumber deal was dissected, showing clearly that Geraldine's own testimony on the witness stand proved conclusively that he had lied, and Mr. Rosewater said he was firmly convinced that fraud and collusion existed through the whole matter, and that he would not believe Geraldine under oath.  He said that if Geraldine were to testify in any court as he had testified in this investigation he could be sent to the penitentiary for perjury.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GIVING VERBAL ORDERS.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater continued to read portions of the testimony bearing on the silent points omitted by the committee in its report, commenting on Geraldine's method of buying large bills of materials, amounting in several instances to several thousand dollars, by simply giving verbal orders and without having any written evidence of the price or other protection for the exposition against a disposition on the part of the sellers to raise the price.  He also commented on the transparent explanations invented by Geraldine to account for some of his peculiar transactions.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater took up the method pursued by Geraldine in the case of the sewer put in by J. F. Daley, in which case it was charged that the plans for the sewer had been made after the work was completed, and connections shown in the plans were proved not to exist under the ground, as was shown by the fact that the engineer on the grounds, the contractor who built the sewer and three or four men engaged for two and one-half days in digging up the sewer to find a connection which the plans showed should have been at a certain point, but which could not be found at all, making i<unclear/> to break into the sewer to make <unclear/><!-- The following text is repeated from earlier in the article: the only thing that Geraldine had done was to botch around and change some of the plans made by other men.  He asserted that Geraldine had no special ability in any direction which would warrant his employment as an expert and he said he should be discharged as a --> acted as though he owned the exposition and had insulted members of the executive committee in the most outrageous manner.  He said that the general public had lost all confidence in Geraldine and believed him to be crooked.  To such an extent had this feeling obtained that Mr. Rosewater warned the directors that his retention meant that all hopes of carrying the $100,000 in bonds proposed to be voted by Douglas county might as well be abandoned, as the voters of this city and county would not vote to turn $100,000 into the treasury of the exposition where it could be manipulated in any way by this man.</p>
                            <p>After Mr. Rosewater had taken his seat F. M. Youngs, the representative of organized labor on the Board of Directors, said a lot of evidence was unnecessary to convince him that Geraldine was incompetent.  He said there had been plenty of people watching the manner in which things had been carried on and the feeling was general among all classes of people that Geraldine was not to be trusted.  If an Omaha man of good standing in the community was put in charge of this work this suspicion would be allayed, but he endorsed what Mr. Rosewater had said, that Geraldine's retention meant that the exposition bonds would be defeated and that a large number of people in the city would refuse to pay anything further on their subscriptions.</p>
                            <p>No further remarks were made by any of the directors and the question was put on the adoption of the resolution.  The "noes" made more noise than the "ayes," and a roll call was demanded.  Then a vote by ballot was called for, resulting in 12 ayes and 22 nays.</p>

                            <p>Immediately following this action Mr. Rosewater handed to the secretary and had read the following letter:</p>
                           <p>Gurdon W. Wattles, President Transmississippi Exposition:  Dear Sir&#8212;I desire, through you, to tender to the board of directors my resignation as member of the executive committee of the Transmississippi Exposition, to take effect from and after October 15, 1897.  I am impelled to this step by my inability to sanction the retention in the service of the exposition as superintendent of grounds and buildings of a man who has usurped the powers and prerogatives of the executive committee and by his own testimony convicted himself of wilful deception, indefensible partiality to contractors, flagrant disregard of the interests of the exposition and expensive incompetency.  In retiring from the executive board I do not yield to anyone in my desire to promote the success of the exposition, but in justice to the stockholders and the people who are taxed for this great enterprise I propose to discharge conscientiously and fearlessly the duties devolving on me as an editor.</p>
                            <signed>E. ROSEWATER.</signed>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater moved the immediate acceptance of his resignation and his motion was seconded by Frank Hibbard.  The president put the question and Hibbard's was the only voice heard in favor of the motion.  A number of the directors voted against accepting the resignation and president declared the motion lost.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater declared that such an action was child's play.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lindsey said Mr. Rosewater must be retained on the executive committee, as his experience was necessary in conducting the Department of Publicity and Promotion and in assisting the committee.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater said it was useless to talk of it; that he could not continue to work with the committee and he would not stay on the committee and see the pilfering and stealing going on all the time without being able to stop it.</p>
                            <p>Frank Hibbard suggested that while salaries were under consideration it would be a good idea to appoint a committee to adjust salaries, and if this committee found people who could as well be dispensed with its advice should be taken.  He moved the appointment of such a committee, but there was no second to this motion, and a motion to adjourn was put and carried.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Whitewashes Geraldine and Compliments the Managers.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The special committee appointed to investigate the charges preferred against Dion Geraldine by Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion of the exposition, submitted its report to the executive committee at its meeting at the Commercial Club rooms yesterday noon.  The report is herewith given in full:</p>
                            <p>To the Executive Committee, Transmississippi and International Exposition&#8212;Gentlemen: Your special committee appointed to conduct an investigation of the charges preferred by Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion against Superintendent Geraldine of the Department of Grounds and Buildings, begs to report as follows:</p>
                            <p>Pursuant to call your special committee met in the office of the ways and means committee at 8 p. m. on Tuesday, October 5, 1897, and proceeded to hear the statements of the parties interested and of such other persons as they desired to be heard, from all of which we find as follows:</p>
                            <p>The charges made by Manager Rosewater were presented in writing and are attached hereto and marked "Exhibit A;" the reply of Superintendent Geraldine was also presented in writing and is attached hereto, marked "Exhibit B."  The testimony submitted is hereto attached and marked "Exhibit C."</p>
                            <p>The first complaint is upon the contract for sheet piling around the lagoon on the exposition grounds. Upon the statements submitted to your committee upon this matter we find that the first bids submitted to the executive committee for doing the work in question were all rejected, as they were considered too high.  The lowest bid was by James P. Connolly at $7,900.  The next lowest
                            
                            <pb n="67" xml:id="TMISB03-067"/>
                            
                            was by Creedon &amp; Mahoney at $8,161.10.  To save further loss of time it would appear that Superintendent Geraldine, with the advice and consent, if not by the direction, of the manager of the department, proceeded to negotiate with these two lowest bidders, as appears to have been customary in such cases, for the lowest price for the work.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">HAD HIS OWN REASONS.</head>
                            <p>Superintendent Geraldine states that (for reasons which seem to be satisfactory to the Department of Grounds and Buildings) he changed the plans and specifications of the work in some minor particulars, and that both contractors were asked to make their new bids upon the modified or changed specifications.  Mr. Connelly states that he knew nothing of the change in specifications and made his bid upon the same plans and specifications as the first one.  It would appear to your committee that the difference of understanding between Contractor Connelly and Superintendent Geraldine is of a character which might and frequently does arise in connection with contracts.  Contractors frequently take for granted things told them by others and fail to take due notice of things which may be placed before them, while others may grasp the situation more clearly from the same presentiment of the case.</p>
                            <p>However that may be, the bid of Contractors Creedon &amp; Mahoney on the second letting was $5,936.50, inclusive of the stay and anchor piles.  Connelly's bid, including the stay and anchor piles, was $7,800.  The cost of doing the stay and anchor pile work was estimated to be between $700 and $800, and as a matter of fact did cost $779.93, which, added to Creedon &amp; Mahoney's bid, made the cost of work on the bid $6,716.43, against Connelly's bid of $7,800.  A deduction of $700 was made in Connelly's bid if he was allowed to set his sheet piling "in a trench instead of being driven," but it was required by Creedon &amp; Mahoney's contract to drive the piles six inches and, as a matter of fact, they were driven six inches.  It is difficult to see how this deduction could be considered by the superintendent.  Mr. Connelly states that he meant to say in his bid that if allowed to set the piles in a trench two feet and drive them the other six inches he would deduct $700, but his bid clearly states that if he was allowed to set the piles "in a trench instead of being driven," he would deduct $700.  We cannot see that the superintendent was chargeable with dereliction of duty in disregarding the deduction of $700, cloaked in the language in which it was.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">MONEY WAS SAVED.</head>
                            <p>We think, therefore, that it is but fair to consider the case from this point, upon a basis of bids from Creedon &amp; Mahoney of $5,936.50, plus the cost of driving main and anchor piles (including labor and material which was furnished by the exposition) amounting to $779.93, equals $6,716.43, against Connelly's bid of $7,800.</p>
                            <p>At this point a question in Manager Rosewater's charges presents itself: A bill of lumber for this sheet piling was contracted for by Superintendent Geraldine, amounting to 175,000 feet, under the order or approval of the executive committee.  As to the purchase it is difficult to see how the superintendent can be charged with dereliction of duty, as the transaction was approved by the executive committee.  Manager Rosewater, however, seems to have understood that the price of lumber was $1 or $1.50 per thousands feet below the market price for such material and the saving in making his purchase was to be realized in securing at the market price for ordinary material cut to standard thickness and design, a stock of material for this special work of special and unusual thickness and design.  It would appear to this committee that the superintendent's intentions were clearly honorable and his judgment well founded, but, in any event, this contract seems to have been places in the name of the exposition among other things to save time, and put in process of manufacture while the bids and contracts were being adjusted, and in order that it might be had promptly in case the exposition failed to make a desirable contract and was forced to do the work itself.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">LOSS TO THE CONTRACTOR.</head>
                            <p>As a matter of fact it appears that the contract was transferred to the contractors, Creedon &amp; Mahoney, who assumed all the obligations of the exposition in the matter, but by Superintendent Geraldine's report it appears that this was not done until after the contract was awarded to them, they being the lowest bidder, and it does not appear to your committee that any loss was sustained by the exposition in the transaction, nor any gain to the contractors.  On the contrary, it would appear from the statements submitted to your committee that the contractors took the lumber at a price above that they expected to pay other lumber dealers for it.  There may be a question of loss raised in connection with the transaction on account of the the waste in the bill thus bought and transferred, on account of the change in the specifications made after this lumber was contracted for and before the contract was let to Creedon &amp; Mahoney.  If so, it would be a loss to the contractor and not to the exposition, and could be reasonably charged to error in judgment which might be noted in connection with other errors, or dereliction of duty.</p>
                            <p>In connection with this branch of the controversy something is said about the difference in value of white and yellow pine for sheet piling.  Contractor Connelly's bid was made, as shown upon its face, based on a price of $18 per thousand feet for yellow pine, and $18.50 for white pine.  Bids from reputable lumber dealers appear to have been made at or about the same time for this same material at $14 for yellow pine and $14.50 for white pine, and in one case the white pine was offered at 15 cents per thousand feet less than the yellow pine, so that in any computation to ascertain the loss to the exposition on account of the use of yellow pine instead of white pine it would not seem to be reasonable to estimate a difference of more than 50 cents per thousand feet.</p>
                            <p>It is stated that the wood work on the lagoon remains unfinished.  It would appear that Superintendent Geraldine's explanation of this should be accepted as reasonable, to-wit: That the openings shown on the work are left for a class of construction not yet determined upon by the executive committee, and are not included in the work paid for.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SILENCE GIVES CONSENT.</head>
                            <p>The second cause for complaint against the superintendent is in reference to the employment of H. W. Tamm as superintendent of construction.  The statement made to your committee would indicate that Superintendent Geraldine was acting under the tacit permission of the acting manager of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, if not of the executive committee, in this matter, and your committee intended to have cut Mr. Tamm off the list of employes, it should have taken affirmative action to the effect, and that it did not do so would reasonably be accepted bu the superintendent as tacit consent.  Your committee would not endorse this method of treating such matters, however, but realizes that with a number of the members of the executive committee absent from the city on business of the exposition and otherwise during a greater portion of the summer, it was exceedingly difficult to transact the large amount of business to be considered and at the same time attend to the private business needing their care and attention, and abide by all the strict rules of the committee in each case.</p>
                            <p>The third cause for complaint is that Superintendent Geraldine let the contractor for a sewer amounting to $809.35 without plans or specifications and without bond.  This would appear to be a transaction growing out of the exigencies of the situation.  The statements made in reference to it indicate that it was a piece of work which required about ten days to complete.  It was to be of the same general character as the city sewers.  The city sewer specifications would govern.  The letting of the contract was approved by the executive committee.  No payment was to be made until the work was completed and accepted by the exposition, under which circumstances a bond would not carry the weight that ordinary cases would call for.  The exposition could lose nothing on account of the absence of the bond, as no payment was to be made until the work was satisfactorily completed.  It would appear to your committee that the superintendent should have secured, at least, the written approval or endorsement of the manager of his department to the letting of a contract in this form before putting it into execution.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">ECONOMY IN DALEY.</head>
                            <p>It is charged that Mr. Daley was employed previous to the letting of this sewer contract by the exposition at $5 per day as inspector, while city inspectors only received $4 per day.  It would appear, however, that in the $5 per day was included the use of a horse and wagon, which saved the expense of such tools, etc., to the exposition. and in fact worked an economy.  The pay rolls appear to have shown this state of facts upon their face and were approved by the manager of the department.  Subsequent to the construction of the sewer Daley is said to have been employed as an inspector at $4 per day, the regular rate, but while so engaged was raking up shavings, etc., in the bottom of the lagoon for which work the contractors were being paid.  It appears that it was pile heads, etc., which Daley was cleaning up from the bottom of the lagoon, which were put there by the exposition itself, and therefore not included in the work to be done by the sheet piling contractors, and, therefore, Daley was working an economy for the exposition in performing such work and hardly subject to censure therefor.</p>
                            <p>The next cause for complaint is on account of changing the landscape plans of the grounds.  Manager Rosewater withdraws this complaint, and it therefore does not come within the scope of your committee's labors.</p>
                            <p>The next cause for complaint is gross negligence of duty in allowing a planing mill to be built in too close proximity to the exposition buildings.  It undoubtedly would have been a wise thing for the superintendent to have called the attention of the executive committee to this matter as soon as it came to his attention, in order that an attorney of the exposition might take steps to prevent its completion.  It appears that a proper permit was issued by the city officials, and your committee is not advised as to whether it was within the power of the exposition to prevent its construction.</p>

                            <head type="sub">TAFFY FOR MANAGERS.</head>
                            <p>To sum up this controversy, your committee would make the following observations:</p>
                            <p>A prodigious task has been undertaken by the exposition organization.  The time allowed for the consummation of its plans is short.  That so much has been accomplished up to the present moment is a marvel to many, if not all, the directors.</p>
                            <p>The ways and means committee has shown remarkable wisdom, care and energy and the results are such as to quicken the enthusiasm of the most doubtful citizen.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Publicity and Promotion has <choice><sic>ascomplished</sic><corr>accomplished</corr></choice> like marvelous results.  Our exposition is the best advertised enterprise of its kind, in the judgment of your committee, since the world's Columbian exposition, even if it is widespread notoriety does not exceed that of that exposition in the same period of time.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Grounds and Buildings has likewise accomplished a great amount of work and has shown marvelous energy in its administration.</p>
                            <p>The Departments of Concessions, Privileges, Exhibits, and in fact every department has shown such energy as to merit the approbation of every friend of the exposition.  The amount of work done and the results accomplished would impress fair-minded men, in the judgement of your committee, with the thought that even though there may have arisen internal differences of opinion as to detail, that the work has been well done and well administered as a whole, and that it would be a calamity to be deplored that the organization which has thus far produced these results should be disturbed.</p>
                            <p>As indicated in this report, there are undoubtedly methods in force at present that might and should be improved.  All business organizations find the same situation constantly.  Through reforms instituted under such circumstances our civilization progresses upward and in it our material strength lies.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">MILD CHASTISEMENT.</head>
                            <p>It appears from all the testimony submitted to your committee that in his administration of the duties connected with his employment Superintendent Geraldine has not had that regard for the manager of his department and for the executive committee that would seem proper, by way of submitting general information concerning the work to his manager and to the executive committee through the manager, in order that the approval and endorsement of the manager of the department might be secured in advance of actual execution of proposed detail; but it would seem that this was a matter which could be remedied for the benefit of the service.  If Superintendent Geraldine remains in the employ of the exposition he should in all cases adhere strictly to the rules of the department and the instructions of the manager.  The subordinate employe should and ought to be willing to keep in close touch with and report fully to keep in close touch with and report fully to and act under clearly stated instructions of the department manager.</p>
                            <p>We are unable to discover any indications of dishonesty on the part of the superintendent or any employe connected with the exposition, and believe the controversy to be one of misunderstanding of motives and positive acts, which can readily be adjusted in future transactions by a union of heart and sentiment in the great work by all, under the guiding wisdom of the executive committee as a whole.</p>
                            <p>Your committee would extend its influence in its present relations as a special committee and recommends that such a result be <choice><sic>arirved</sic><corr>arrived</corr></choice> at.</p>

                            <head type="sub">THANKS TO THE COMMITTEE.</head>
                            <p>After the reading of the report Mr. Rosewater moved that it be placed on file.  This was adopted, as was also a motion by Mr. Reed, returning thanks to the special committee for its labors.</p>
                            <p>After this had been done Mr. Rosewater remarked that the report discredited every witness except Geraldine and ignored completely the most important points brought out by the testimony.  He said he would bring the matter before the Board of Directors and would also publish the evidence so that the public might see that Geraldine's admissions of manipulation were sufficient to convince him without any further evidence.  He charged that Geraldine's contradictions of his own testimony and his wilful misstatements while under examination were enough to convict him of perjury in any court in the land.  Mr. Rosewater continued to recall numerous important points which the committee had failed to touch upon and referred to the changes which had been made in the ground plans of the bluff tract by Geraldine, which charge Mr. Rosewater said he had dismissed before he learned that Geraldine had been holding Ulrich's resignation for two months without the knowledge of any member of the committee.</p>
                            <p>In this connection President Wattles said he had ordered Geraldine to stop grading the bluff tract, as it would cost $15,000 or $20,000 to make it level, and he said that Geraldine had stated at that time that Ulrich had written him a letter saying he had decided to sever his connections with the exposition entirely.  Mr. Wattles said he then told Geraldine to stop all work in carrying out Ulrich's plan and remarked to Geraldine that some local party could probably be secured to make a plan for this tract which would be cheaper to execute.  Mr. Wattles denied most emphatically that he had authorized or instructed Geraldine to make any new plan for the bluff tract, but detailed a few small changes he had authorized made in the way of preparatory grading, which were in the nature of omissions from Ulrich's plan.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST IT.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater rather warmly denounced the methods which had been pursued by Geraldine and declared that the court of public opinion would not countenance such open disregard of business principles as had been admitted by Geraldine on the witness stand.  He cited instances where Geraldine had admitted buying large lots of supplies and materials on verbal orders without contracts or other written evidences of prices or other necessary data and he charged that such loose methods of doing business might cause the loss of thousands of dollars.  Mr. Rosewater declared that Geraldine was not an expert in any sense of the word and was no more competent to conduct the affairs of the exposition than hundreds of other men.</p>
                            <p>At this point Mr. Wattles interjected the remark that Geraldine had saved the exposition money by buying water pipe for $16.75 per ton, whereas the water company had said that it would cost at least $20 per ton.</p>
                            <p>In reply to this Mr. Rosewater said that the pipe purchased by Geraldine was such <choice><sic>rotton</sic><corr>rotten</corr></choice> stuff that the water company would never allow it to be unloaded if it was shipped to them.  He said that fully 20 per cent of it was broken in shipment and that pieces of it in his possession showed that it was dear at any price.  He also charged that the "specials" purchased by Geraldine and landed on the exposition grounds, the pieces of pipe other than the long straight pipe, were of a pattern and quality which had been rejected by the water company fourteen years ago, and which would not be used by the water company under any circumstances, so that the alleged saving affected by Geraldine was entirely imaginary.</p>
                            <p>This discussion was continued for some time, but no action was taken on the report by the committee other than to place it on file.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">OTHER MATTERS CONSIDERED.</head>
                            <p>When regular business was resumed President Wattles stated that the governments of Bolivia and China had accepted the invitations to participate in the exposition, and the Costa Rica government had expressed the hope that it would be able to participate.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="68" xml:id="TMISB03-068"/>
                            
                            <p>The secretary laid before the committee a document which, he said, had been handed to him by Homer Moore with the request that it be presented to the committee.  It proved to be a letter written by Mr. Moore transmitting a petition, signed by seventy members of the Mondamin Choral society of Omaha, entering a vigorous protest against the appointment of confirmation of "one of Mr. Rommell as musical director of the exposition."  As no appointment of Mr. Rommell, or any other person had been submitted to the committee, and as the matter of the appointment of a musical director had not been brought up, the protest was not considered.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wattles reported that he had investigated the question of city taxes on the property being used for the exposition grounds and had found that the city authorities had no authority to rebate the taxes for this year, and he suggested tat the only remedy seemed to be for the management to pay these taxes and to endeavor to have the next Board of Equalization omit or reduce the taxes on this property for next year.  The matter was referred to the Department of Buildings and Grounds for a statement of the amount of taxes due.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall submitted the tabulation of the bids for the erection of the Art building opened Monday night.  He recommended that the contract for the carpenter work be let to Hamilton Brothers, the lowest bidders, for $26,414.  This recommendation was approved.  Mr. Kirkendall reported that the only bidder on the staff work was the firm of Smith &amp; Eastman, the firm which had already secured four of the largest buildings on the main court, the bid being $11,911.  Action on awarding this contract was deferred for future consideration.</p>
                            <p>The committee adjourned to meet at noon today.</p>

                            <l>&#8212;</l>
                            <p>The straw vote is again abroad in the land and, what is to be greatly deplored, he seems to know no quarantine lines.</p>
                            <l>&#8212;</l>
                            <p>The exposition board of directors has voted that Geraldine is indispensable.  All contractors that do not stand in must govern themselves accordingly.</p>
                            <l>&#8212;</l>
                            <p>A leopard cannot change his spots, but they can be changed for him with a paint brush.  That is how the exposition grand juke has been vindicated.</p>
                            <l>&#8212;</l>
                            <p>A vote of confidence in Geraldine is not needed to confirm Geraldine's confidence in himself, but it will take more than one vote to restore the confidence of the people in the exposition boss.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">EXONERATING GERALDINE&#8212;INDICTING WATTLES.</hi></head>
                            <p>The directors of the Transmississippi Exposition have endorsed the report exonerating Dion Geraldine from the charges of willful deception, indefensible partiality to contractors, flagrant disregard of the interests of the exposition and expensive incompetency.  In giving Geraldine a vote of confidence by twenty-two out of thirty-four the board had acquitted Geraldine and registered an indictment of its president, Gurdon W. Wattles.</p>
                            <p>No other conclusion can be reached by any rational person who reads the report of the investigating committee.  That report, in so many words, says that Geraldine, "for reasons which seemed to be satisfactory to the Department of Grounds and Buildings," changed the plans and specifications on the lagoon contracts and in settling with the contractor, who had been given special advantages in bidding and been allowed to omit materials valued fully $1,000 without any deduction, was acting in accord with the acting head of the department, Mr. Wattles.</p>
                            <p>In exonerating Geraldine from any blame for placing on the exposition pay roll a superintendent of construction without authority of the executive committee and in violation of its rules and in retaining this man on the pay roll after the executive committee had declined to sanction the employment the Board of Directors has voted an indictment of President Wattles.  If Geraldine is blameless the blame must be laid at the door of Mr. Wattles, who was at that time temporarily at the head of the Department of Buildings and Grounds.  It was Mr. Wattles who brought Geraldine's request for a superintendent to the executive board.  Mr. Wattles was present when the board refused to sanction the appointment.  If Geraldine tells the truth when he denies any knowledge of the action of the board then Mr. Wattles is not only guilty of withholding from the executive board the information that Geraldine's sub-superintendent was already on the pay roll before he asked permission to employ him, but also of inexcusable neglect in not informing Geraldine that the board had declined to employ him and seeing that his name was taken off the pay roll.  As president of the exposition Mr. Wattles is in duty bound to live up to the rules and bylaws.  He had no more right to violate these rules than Geraldine.  The only ground on which Geraldine is excused by the investigating committee is that he acted under the direction of Wattles and with his full knowledge and consent.</p>
                            <p>In exonerating Geraldine for failure to require a written contract and bond from Sewer Contractor Dailey the directors have arraigned Mr. Wattles, under whose direction and with whose consent Geraldine claims to have acted.  Inasmuch as President Wattles has not seen fit to contradict any of the statements made by Geraldine, which not only implicated him in the questionable transactions and in flagrant usurpations of authority vested exclusively in the executive committee, the inevitable inference is that Mr. Wattles is justly responsible for Geraldine's shortcomings and misconduct.  The fact that Geraldine has been sustained by Mr. Wattles throughout and that Mr. Wattles has seen nothing improper in Geraldine's course would indicate that he is willing to share the responsibility.</p>
                            <p>The stockholders of the exposition look to the president to protect their interests by enforcing business methods in every department and honest compliance with contracts let on square competition.  The failure of President Wattles to exercise the vigilance demanded by his position and his standing up for Geraldine can be construed in only one way, and that is that for some inexplicable reason he and Geraldine have linked themselves together.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The following is a stenographic report of the testimony before the investigating committee of the exposition resulting from the charges filed against Dion Geraldine, superintendent of construction under the Department of Buildings and Grounds.  This is the first installment of the testimony and will be continued in tomorrow's paper:</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I think the proper order is for Mr. Rosewater to show that these charges can be substantiated with proper evidence and after hearing that we will be pleased for Mr. Geraldine to give us his defense, if he has any.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;I have no formal advice of the proceedings which have resulted in my being here tonight&#8212;simply an informal request by telephone to come up here&#8212;and I would like to know just what the matter is.</p>
                            <p>Kirkendall&#8212;At our last meeting this report of Mr. Rosewater's was brought in and was a perfect surprise to me.  While I am supposed to be at the head of the department, I had never heard of it before.  I thought that the courtesy was due to Mr. Geraldine that he should be heard on this subject, and so I made a motion to that effect.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I presume it is understood, at least I want to say in beginning that I stated at the time the resolution was presented that I wanted to grant Geraldine the widest latitude in making a showing; and I concurred at once in the motion made then to have the matter heard fully and in public, so that there could be no concealment.  That motion was carried, but subsequently reconsidered and the board decided that they would call in three directors, who have no part in the management, and who would be, therefore, entirely and thoroughly disinterested and influenced by no prejudice, and have them hear and determine the property of carrying out the resolution, or vindicating Mr. Geraldine if they find there is no foundation for the charges.  Now, inasmuch as I am called on to substantiate this matter first, I expected this: That Mr. Geraldine would file his response to these charges, and then the two sides would be before this house, and then I would proceed to substantiate it.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;You have not any response to make to the charges until after Mr. Rosewater has been heard?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I would prefer to hear him first.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I noticed in the World-Herald a card from Mr. Geraldine, which was called to my attention for the first time today, that he had a written response prepared.  And that is the usual way.  In starting a case the one party makes its charge and the other party brings in its general preliminary defense, and then the matter is heard and the evidence is brought in, and that way I can rebut any evidence that is brought in here.  Otherwise I shall do so later.  Of course this is not a law case.  It is simply a question of fact, and the board probably will not pursue the course of introducing technical objections.  My understanding is that they want to simply know all the truth.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I think that is what the committee wants&#8212;to know all the facts in the case.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;In the beginning, I will enter upon the first charge, that is, the charge relating to this contract.  And before I proceed I will ask Mr. Geraldine to state whether it is not true that the board, at a meeting held some time in July, ratified the purchase of a quantity of lumber not to exceed $3,000.  No information was given to us that any contractors would be given the use of this lumber at its cut rate, but were assured that we should have the benefit of the cut rate in case the lumber was used.  It was also understood at that time that it might be that the board, having rejected the first proposals, we would probably let the work out and buy its own materials, just as Mr. Connolly's proposal asked for him to bid.  He bid in the first place $7,900 to complete the work in white pine&#8212;clear white pine&#8212;and to do it in exact accordance with the plans and specifications.  Later on he was informed that a change had been made in the plans and specifications and to divide his bids and that we, the exposition, would buy the piles and drive them and furnish that part of it; he to furnish the labor on the one side and the material on the other.  He sub-divided his bids and proposed to do the labor for $2,100.<unclear/>
                            
                            <pb n="69" xml:id="TMISB03-069"/>
                            
                            yellow pine that was said to be offered to us at a cut rate and on which several hundred dollars might be saved to the exposition?</p>
                            <p>Kirkendall&#8212;I will state that it is a fact.  Mr. Geraldine informed me that these bidders had offered the pine at something higher than we could buy it for&#8212;$1 to $2 or something of that kind.  Upon that information I said I will go to the committee (I think it was the same day as the committee meeting)&#8212;I will grant the privilege of buying this lumber and then take it to the committee and explain it to them.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;When this purchase was announced to the board the action had already taken place, Mr. Geraldine had already bought the lumber.  We were asked to ratify the purchase made before we were asked to authorize the purchase.</p>
                            <p>Kirkendall&#8212;That is true.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Then we ratified it.  And we were assured that we were saving from $1 to $1.50 per 1,000, and that the total would aggregate about $3,000 or somewhere in that neighborhood.</p>
                            <p>Kirkendall&#8212;It was about that, I believe.  This is the amount as figured from various standpoints and from a number of bids, and I did not get all of it.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">BOARD NOT ADVISED.</head>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;The board had no information about this matter of entering into bids.  All we knew was that the lumber was bought.  It is not material what it would cost us to do the whole other work.  He proposed to do the whole thing for $2,100, including the piling.  That was for the labor alone, without material.  We had then bought about $3,000 worth of lumber, and I am ready and prepared to show that no more than $3,000 worth of lumber was used, and that if we had let that contract at $2,100 and bought our own materials we would have saved not less than $1,000.  And it is further true and can be substantiated that the work is not done, that portion of it that relates to the pile driving is wretchedly done, that we have been cheated on the piles they have been putting in, and in that regard the work is very inferior to what the original plan contemplated as submitted to the contractors.  And I want, in substantiation of this charge, to submit here a letter signed by Mr. Thomas Shaw.  I will read it to the board.  (Letter is read.)</p>
                            <p>I did not read this report until two days ago, since I preferred the charges, but I had a personal interview with this gentleman and from personal talk I had reached the conclusions that I embodied in these charges.  Since I had the charges preferred I took the trouble to ascertain as near as possible exactly how much lumber has been used in that lagoon, and also to ascertain as near as I could the value of that lumber.  I had a report in the first place of every stick that is in that lake, so that we would know what they were, and here they are described.  I submitted the measurements first to Mr. Baker, our superintendent, who is a <choice><sic>first-clas</sic><corr>first-class</corr></choice> mechanic, and here is his statement.  I submitted it also to the Bullard Lumber company, and there is their's, and they agree to a foot.  The only mistake Mr. Baker made was in figuring sixteen here, instead of 160.  But these figures as shown here are correct, representing this lumber.  Mr. Bullard says this:  (Reads.)  So there was about 200,000 feet.  He says the above bill of lumber any dealer in Omaha would have been glad to fill from August 1 to August 15 on the basis of $15.50 per 1,000, f. o. b. cars Omaha.  The same white pine would have cost at least $3, and possibly $4, per 1,000 more, as these sizes in white pine reach from $1.50 to $2 more than the sixteen inch.  Nearly two-thirds of the bill is composed of these two items.  August 13, the day on which the contract was let, the regular retail price for yellow pine, dimension, was only $13.20 per 1,000, delivered in town in small bills, and the regular price of 3x12 delivered in small quantities was only $15 per 1,000 feet.  I submit this letter to the board.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SOME FIGURES PRESENTED.</head>
                            <p>Taking a different summary from what I have presented there&#8212;and it is not material to the main point as regards the care that has been exercised to protect the interests of the exposition; it is not very material whether the first estimate is exactly in accord with this estimate showing about the state of affairs.  I wanted to estimate it, knowing just what lumber has been used, what we could have done this work for if we had done it ourselves with our own lumber at the reduced price, or at a higher price, and also what it actually has cost.  I put the summary in this form:</p>

                            <p>If the lumber was bought at $13.50, add $100; $14, add another $100.  The difference in favor of Creedon &amp; Mahoney, the exposition furnishing the lumber at $13 a 1,000, would have been $1,236.50; furnishing it at $13.50, $1,136.50; at $14 a 1,000 the difference would have been $1,036.50.  That is substantially the basis and I want now to call upon the secretary to substantiate the figures as regards the contract.  I do not suppose Mr. Geraldine will deny that the contract of Creedon &amp; Mahoney was $5,936.50.  If he does not deny it, then there is no need of controversy on that point, and every cent of that amount has been paid, although they have not completed their work.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;What is the amount?</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;$5,936.50.  If that be true, and it is not denied, then we know what we have paid.  We also know what the board was to have paid for that lumber.  And now I want Mr. Geraldine to answer this question: Did Mr. Connolley have an opportunity to use the yellow pine turned over to Creedon &amp; Mahoney?  Was that opportunity offered him?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Am I supposed to answer this man's questions?</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I presume it would be right.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;It was not.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Was any other contractor offered that opportunity?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Then that part of it is substantiated.  It shows, as I have alleged, that there was partiality in favor of Creedon &amp; Mahoney was practically a preferred bid.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;In regard to this contract to Creedon &amp; Mahoney, was that let by the board; did the board approve it?</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;The board approved it, but the board had no knowledge that Creedon &amp; Mahoney were given the special preference.  We were notified that the contract had been let and closed; that this lumber had been turned over to them.  We did not know, either, what concession they made for it.  What concession did Creedon &amp; Mahoney make on the lumber which they received through this exposition?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;What concession did they make?</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Did they make any reduction from the amount of their original bid?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;None whatever.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I have nothing further to say as regards this particular part.  I will now proceed to the other case.  I think the second charge is the Daly contract, is it not?</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;There is one point here.  Something is said here about consent.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;That matter is stated exactly and I don't think Mr. Geraldine will deny that the contract contained this provision, that cement shall be used at the option of the exposition, with the superintendent deciding whether or not it shall be.  Now, no cement has been used there and I don't think anyone will contend that cement has been used, and I do not suppose that I will have to prove that no reduction has been made in the contract.  Has there been any reduction?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;There has been no reduction.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">HERE TAMM COMES IN.</head>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Now as to this other matter, I don't suppose there will be any dispute.  The board had a session, I think, on the 27th of August, and in the absence of Manager Kirkendall the president, who had taken his place temporarily, presented a request from Mr. Geraldine to the board that Mr. Tamm be employed as an assistant superintendent at a salary of $100 per month.  Objection was made to the employment and the matter was laid over without action.  I think that is exactly what happened.  Mr. Wattles made the request on the behalf of Mr. Geraldine.  The request was not granted, but the motion was laid over and no action has been taken since that time.  On the 1st of September, when the board of directors received its copies of reports, I, among others, received my notice of the names of the employes in the various departments and found Mr. Tamm's name on the pay roll of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, under direction of Mr. Geraldine, credited with sixteen days' work as superintendent of construction, $60.  That, of course, as anyone can figure, is in excess of $100 per month.  And it showed that at the very time when we were asked to employ this man he had already been employed as superintendent, under a title he had no right to, and he has been there since.  He has been on the pay roll at $4 a day for September and on Saturday last the board, in order to enable him to draw his pay legally, as he had never been authorized, we had to legalize the action so far as his pay is concerned.  The point I raise is that it is the duty of Mr. Geraldine to make his request in time for employing these men.  If it was a proper subject for the board to act upon, having failed to receive the sanction of the board, he should have left the board the responsibility of anything that might happen by reason of that failure, and not to force upon us on the pay roll a man whose employment was not authorized.  I don't think that requires any great amount of talk.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I would like to know what Mr. Geraldine's authority is for the employment of men in the absence of any action being taken on the subject by the board; whether he is only allowed to employ men or assistants with the consent of the board; whether he has any discretion at all of his own that he could exercise.</p>
                            <p>Kirkendall&#8212;It is not intended that he shall use any discretion.  The rules are that he can simply suggest or recommend.</p>
                            <p>Wattles&#8212;I will call your attention, Mr. Kirkendall, to a general rule that was adopted.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Do I understand that Mr. Geraldine had any authority?</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;There was authority given in March for some work.  Mr. Kirkendall stated it was necessary to put up a shop to keep the tools in and so on, and he was authorized to secure the material and employ the necessary labor to make the temporary building.</p>
                            <p>Wattles&#8212;Under what authority have all these men been employed since that time?</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;They have not had authority.</p>
                            <p>Wattles&#8212;Then do I understand that you have been paying these salaries without any authority whatever?</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;We have been paying the wages on the pay roll of the manager of the department.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">OTHERS MADE REPORTS.</head>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;One thing is clear.  There had to be some latitude given to Mr. Geraldine.  We could not expect him to report every laborer he employed to the board.  Under ordinary circumstances, in the case of a laborer, where a man is employed and may be laid off in a few days, I suppose there would be no action, but inasmuch as he asked this board to give its consent to the employment of Mr. Tamm, then he should have rested.  You cannot do both things.  You can't eat your pie and have it at the same time.  That is not such a very serious matter, except that it does involve financial considerations in the long run.  It involves discipline, too.  In this way the board has no authority.  It might just as well abrogate is power to its superintendents and men on the pay roll and let them do just about as they please.  In every case I have had anything to do with I have had to report everything and have it approved by the board, even to a messenger boy.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I was trying to ascertain just what authority had been given Mr. Geraldine for the employment of persons, or whether it took the action of the executive committee to employ anyone, unless it was an ordinary laborer.</p>
                            <p>Kirkendall&#8212;We considered at the time that the action of the board was necessary, although there have been several times when something was coming up when they granted me the authority to go ahead and do what was necessary to finish up the work.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Then after the application was made for the approval of the board for Mr. Tamm's employment, was the board cognizant of the fact that Mr. Tamm was still retained?</p>
                            <p>Wattles&#8212;Yes, I think so.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;And was it with their silent consent, or knowledge, that he was retained?</p>
                            <p>Wattles&#8212;I know the matter was mentioned several times, that he was on the pay roll anyhow.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;And the board knew it?</p>
                            <p>Wattles&#8212;I think every member of the board heard it.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;The first knowledge we had of it was when that pay roll that the secretary sends monthly to every member of the Board of Directors reached us.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Mr. Tamm was employed by Mr. Geraldine and a report made, and a request that he be continued in employment?</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;That was not the way.  The request was that we should authorize him to employ Mr. Tamm.  We did not know he was on the pay roll, but after we had declined to act upon it the report reached us, three or four days later, that he had already been on the pay roll for twelve days before that request was made.  That is the point.  Of course in the absence of Mr. Kirkendall and the way things were running the matter was allowed to rest, as everything has been allowed to rest.  There has been some talk about it, but it was not the right way to do business.  We do not contend that Mr. Tamm was not earning his money.  I don't know anything about that.</p>

                            <head type="sub">NEVER EARNED THE MONEY.</head>
                            <p>Now as to Mr. Daley.  I won't dwell any length of time on him having $5 a day first.  It simply shows that it was paying a man recklessly more than what was the standard for the same kind of work, as paid by the city.  He never earned $5 a day in his life.  But here was the fact.  Plans and specifications were supposed to be drawn in the office of Mr. Geraldine for the sewer.  Bids were advertised for and the bids were opened.  On opening the bids we found that Mr. Daley was $1.48 below Henry Sharp, the next lowest bidder.  In view of the fact that Mr. Daley had been an employe, or at least was known to have been on the pay roll, objection was raised that a man on the pay roll should bid for a contract.  This objection was sustained by the board and the contract was awarded to Mr. Sharp.  Two days later a meeting of the board was called and we were notified that there was a mistake; that Mr. Daley was no longer on the pay roll and had not been for some week or ten days and, as he was the lowest bidder, he was entitled to the contract.  Thereupon the matter was reconsidered and the contract was awarded to him&#8212;to Mr. Daley.  Mr. Sharp was in the ante room&#8212;I don't know but in this room&#8212;when the proposition was before the board, and after we had received it he was notified that he had no contract.  He had been notified first, or had supposed from the announcement, that he had been awarded the contract.  On the way down I inquired of Mr. Sharp how it could be that he could be within $1.48 on a contract of $809.35; how it could be within $1.48 of another bidder.  And I asked him what plans and specifications he had had.  He said, 'There are no specifications.'  I was very much surprised.  But I did not know much about it and supposed when the contract came for our ratification that the plans and specifications would be with the contract in some form.  But no contract was ever submitted to the board, nor any bond, and at the end of some weeks&#8212;a couple of weeks&#8212;we discovered that Mr. Daley had finished his job and drawn his pay.  I then went to the secretary and asked whether or not there had been such a contract and bond filed, and found there had not, but after the work had been completed a letter written by Mr. Geraldine to Mr. Daley, saying that his bid was accepted, and with the city specifications for sewer work pinned thereto, were filed with the secretary.  It is not material to go through these specifications.  But I want to show you how contractors are treated here.  I saw Mr. Sharp this evening just before I came down.  He came into my office accidentally and I asked him about this, and I will read you what he says.  (Reads.)</p>
                            <p>This is what Henry Sharp stated to me and is willing to swear to: "I called in at the office and was introduced to the draughtsman, whoever he is, and he showed me the profile and grade of the sewer.  I asked where the specifications were and he said
                            
                            <pb n="70" xml:id="TMISB03-070"/>
                            
                            there were none.  I asked if we should bid and use specifications such as we were in the habit of using here in the city bids, and he replied that he supposed so."</p>
                            <p>This is Henry Sharp's experience after the contract had been awarded: "I went in and stepped up to Mr. Geraldine and said: 'Mr. Geraldine, I understand that I had the contract awarded to me for that sewer work.'  He said, 'I haven't heard anything about it.'  I looked at him and said I had read it in the newspaper and had a clipping from The Bee to that effect, and Mr. Geraldine made the reply that 'anything you see in that newspaper is a lie.'  That rather staggered me and I then said to him, 'Mr. Geraldine, you say that this has not been awarded to me,' and he said, 'not that I know of.'  I said, 'in case it is awarded how shall I find it out?'  He replied, 'I will notify you by mail.'"</p>
                            <p>Did Mr. Daley inspect a sewer that was built by the exposition on the exposition grounds?  Was that the work he inspected?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;He was formerly the superintendent.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GERALDINE DODGES ISSUE.</head>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Now is it not true, Mr. Geraldine, that on Thursday of this last week Mr. Daley was asked to find the Y for a connection with a pipe in the sewer which he had superintended, and that he could not find it; that yards and yards of dirt were raked up and nothing could be done; that the engineers on Friday spent the whole day in trying to find this place, although they had their maps showing where it should be found, and that on Saturday morning they broke into the sewer to make that connection?  Answer yes or no.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I never heard anything of the kind.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;You can inquire into it then, and I will prove it by your engineer.  I want to say now, though, that he did not communicate this, because he knows nothing about this, and I don't want him to rest under that suspicion.  I know that spies are kept out there on the grounds and I know that our reporters cannot go through the grounds without being followed.</p>
                            <p>Now, taking up the next case.  This refers to the erection of a planing mill in very close proximity, I am told within about eighty feet, of one of the main buildings.  We had been informed by Mr. Geraldine months and months before that the erection of that mill was in contemplation and that he had been negotiating with the party to have it erected in that neighborhood, where, I did not know.  I take, however, that he kept himself informed that he should have been notified at once, if he did not see it himself, when the first nail for that mill was driven.  It seems that with reasonable vigilance if any notice had been served upon the board we could have gone to the city authorities and had that mill stopped; that is, either have prevented the issuance of a permit for its construction or have declared the building of such a concern a nuisance and dangerous to the exposition.  I believe that even now we have a right and can go before the council, if we want to, and cause a fire limit to be established within two blocks or three blocks all around that exposition, to be good until the exposition closes, so that no more frame buildings can be put up surrounding that exposition.  But this is not a part of my complaint.  That should have been prevented and we ought to have been notified by Mr. Geraldine, who is supposed to be at the grounds every day, that the planing mill was to be built by those parties in that neighborhood.</p>

                            <p>As to the last charge, in order to save the time of this body and not to pester it with looking over maps and specifications, I will withdraw it.  There have been alterations made, but it is not a material matter.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;There is one point here that seems to have been passed over.  It is regarding the changing of ground plan.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Yes, that is what I just referred to and I will let that go, at least for the present.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;How would you like to have me deal with this matter?</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;We gave Mr. Rosewater full scope to make his own statement and I think you would be entitled to the same.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;On the evening of October 2 I received from the secretary a copy of the charges made by Mr. Rosewater and on that evening I dictated a reply to the executive committee, as I understood that my answer to the charges was to be heard by the executive committee.  Since that time the matter has been changed.  What I dictated then is here, in carbon copies, and while going over this matter verbally in detail I would be pleased to hand you each a copy.</p>
                            <p>The first statement here is that the plans and specifications were prepared by Mr. Shaw.  Mr. Shaw was employed on this work for a few days.  He made the drawings under my direction and prepared a rough sketch of the specifications, which I revised, as I also made some changes in the drawings.  It is stated here that the bids on these plans and specifications were opened by me with no bidder present.  The bids were opened in the office of the Department of Grounds and Buildings in the presence of Mr. Kirkendall, the chief clerk, and others.  After opening these bids and finding them too high, as stated in this reply, I stated to Mr. Kirkendall that the work should be done soon, that we were behind on it then, having been delayed in the matter unexpectedly, and that the lumber for the sheet piling would take some time to procure and get the quality and the condition it required.  At the time of advertising for the bids, on or about July 15, I also asked several local lumbermen to make us a figure on the lumber for sheet piling and the propositions I received are hereto attached.  On the day the bids were opened and found to be too high I explained to Mr. Kirkendall that the work of the sheet piling should be done as soon as possible and, as there was prospect of further delay in letting the contract, suggested that we order the sheet piling for the reason that I wished to have it specially selected, and all this would require considerable time.  It was better, therefore, to order the lumber at once and if we afterwards let the work by contract to turn the order over to the contractor and have the order that far under way.  Mr. Kirkendall told me to go ahead with such arrangement and he would bring the matter before the exposition immediately, which he did and received the authority for the purchase.  It is stated by Mr. Rosewater and confirmed, I think, by Mr. Kirkendall, that the lumber was purchased before any authority was given.  There was a meeting of the executive committee on the evening of the day on which the bids were opened and Mr. Kirkendall went from my office direct to that meeting.  The lumber was ordered at that time verbally with the understanding that unless confirmed by Mr. Kirkendall from the executive committee that it was not to apply.  Prior to this time all question of using white pine has disappeared from our calculations for the following reasons: In examination of the stock in the Omaha lumber yards, etc. (reading from the written statement.)</p>
                            <p>It has been stated here that the difference between white pine and yellow pine was about $4.  Here are two proposals which I received at that time from the lumbermen.  I had proposals from nearly all, if not all, of them.  I am unable to find them; I supposed that they were on file, but I find these only, and I would like to have the committee look at these.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WHITE AND YELLOW PINE.</head>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;I notice that white pine is quoted lower than the plain, yellow pine and that yellow pine dressed and tongued and grooved is quoted lower than the white pine.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The reason for that is this: Yellow pine is shipped from the south, a long distance, and the matter of freight cuts a very high figure in the price of lumber.  If it can be ordered in time so that they can dress it, it removes that much freight and they are enabled to deliver it at a lower price.  I might refer to that at this point to settle this question of the difference in cost of lumber.  The No. 1 white pine in three-inch planks which I found in the yards of Omaha and which I conferred with lumbermen about is not as good quality as the yellow pine.  It has more knots and defects and it is admitted from the northern classification, where it is not admitted by the southern.  The only possible preference there could be for white pine is its durability in this climate.  Yellow pine is much stronger and the element of strength is to be considered in this work.  For that reason I wanted a plank that would dress fully three inches.  In ordering this lumber from the Cady Lumber company, their wholesale dealers, a coal and coke company of Kansas City which controls the larger portion of the lumber supply over the new road from the gulf, was here.  I wanted to get a plank that would dress on one side to three inches.  They agreed to saw this lumber to three and one-quarter inches, or nearly three and one-quarter inches, and dress it to three inches, which would give the strength and thickness we required.  They also agreed to tongue and groove it on the drawing that I submitted.  It is stated here by some one that this tongue was only three-eighths of an inch; that statement is untrue.  The tongue is fully one-half inch, made in V shape and is a special design particularly suitable for this work.  In ordering that bill of lumber I took all those matters into consideration; I also called for No. 1 select lumber, the very best quality, and because of these specifications and the increased thickness I agreed to pay $1 per 1,000 feet higher than I could have got the common lumber at.  It is stated somewhere in these charges that this lumber that we furnished is of second quality; that statement is absolutely untrue; I have not in my experience for years handled as fine a lot of lumber as was furnished for this purpose by the Cady Lumber company.  The lumber is out there; anyone can examine it and it will speak for itself.</p>

No action was taken upon the matter, the committee referring it for consideration in executive session.</p>

                            <p>The persistency of these attacks call for prompt attention.  Mr. Rosewater has resigned.  His resignation should be promptly accepted.  His usefulness as a member of the executive board is at an end.  If he is an enemy of the exposition because he could not rule in all things let him take his stand outside the breastworks behind which loyal Omahans are fighting the battle for their town.</p>
                            <p>A town that is not big enough to withstand the bluff and bluster of one man who bluffs and blusters because he cannot bring every other man to his own way of thinking is not a big enough town to successfully carry out a Transmississippi exposition.</p>
                            <p>Let Mr. Rosewater go&#8212;and help him with his going.  Let it be established right now as an Omaha rule that he who is not with Omaha is against Omaha.  Let it be written upon the outer walls of this city, where he who runs may read, that the opinion of every good citizen is entitled to all due weight, but that one-man rule is a thing of the past.&#8212;G. M. Hitchcock in the World-Herald.</p>
                            <p>On the eve of the campaign against prohibition in 1890 G. M. Hitchcock started on a pleasure tour of Europe.  During his absence abroad his paper played fast and loose with the vital issue while The Bee was battling might and main to ward off the blight that was threatening the prosperity of this city and state.  Returning from Europe in the very midst of the struggle, G. M. Hitchcock issued his famous manifesto, "Throw the Jonah Overboard."  That frantic appeal of the man who has squandered a half million dollars in wrecking two newspapers was almost a duplicate of his present demand on the exposition board to let Rosewater go and help him with his going.</p>
                            <p>In 1897, as in 1890, the editor of The Bee did not seek the arduous task imposed upon him.  As manager of the anti-prohibition campaign he labored night and day with pen and voice to achieve success, without pay and without reward.  In spite of the Jonah cry and the backfire of imbeciles and malcontents he conducted the campaign to a victorious ending and buried prohibition by 50,000 majority.</p>
                            <p>The position which the editor of The Bee holds as one of the managers of the Transmississippi Exposition which G. M. Hitchcock covets was unsolicited and his work on behalf of the exposition has been performed with no other hope of reward than the promotion of the general public interest.  The resignation of Rosewater from the Board of Managers is neither bluff nor bluster, nor an attempt to dominate the board.  It is a positive declination to serve in the executive board so long as Dion Geraldine is retained in the service in the face of convincing proof that he has imposed upon the credulity of his superiors, confidenced the exposition and stood in with favored contractors.</p>
                            <p>The war on Geraldine and the censure of Wattles for convincing with him and usurping powers to the detriment of the exposition is not a war upon the exposition.  On the contrary, it is an effort to reinstate the exposition in popular confidence, which cannot be regained so long as Geraldine is retained in charge of the work of construction.  If The Bee succeeds in dethroning Geraldine and compelling President Wattles to carry on the business of the exposition upon business methods it will accomplish more for the success of the exposition than all of the backers and satellites of Geraldine have done or can do for this great enterprise.</p>
                            <p>So far as Rosewater is concerned he has asked to be relieved and does not ask to be retained.  If his usefulness to the exposition is at an end, he has no desire to intrude himself upon the management when it is so plain that Mr. Hitchcock is itching to take the place and everybody knows that he will work in harmony with Geraldine and is sure to inspire faith in the integrity of his beneficiaries and side partners.  All that is needed now for the success of the exposition is to take up Hitchcock's old cry, "Throw the Jonah Overboard."</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition held a short session at 5 o'clock last evening at the request of Manager Rosewater, who recommended the purchase of the bird's-eye view of the exposition grounds made by E. J. Austen, an artist employed by the Werner Publishing company.  The picture had been carefully examined by members of the executive committee and connoisseurs of such matters and was pronounced most excellent.  The committee decided to purchase the picture at the price stated in the agreement, which caused it to be made, $300, it being agreed that the name of the artist was to appear on copies made from the drawing.  The picture is a black and white wash drawing and shows the exposition grounds as seen from an elevation southeast of the bluff tract, showing the handsome main court to the best advantage and giving a faithful idea of the entire exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>The committee decided to send Mrs. Ford, secretary of the Woman's board, to the annual meeting of the Liberal Religion congress, with a view of securing the next meeting of that body.</p>

                            <head type="main">PROOF OF CHARGES AGAINST GERALDINE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Stenographic Report of the Testimony Taken by the Investigating Committee.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Following will be found a continuation of the testimony taken by the special committee which investigated the charges of corruption and collusion made against Dion Geraldine, superintendent of construction of the Transmississippi and International Exposition.  In yesterday's issue was printed the testimony leading up to the admission by Geraldine that he had changed the specifications for the sheet piling at the lagoon.  What followed here is given:</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I think there is a charge here that the specifications called for white pine.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes.  And that in letting the contract preference was given to yellow pine, which was, according to the charge, a lower priced material.</p>
                            <p>Was that correct, that the specifications called for white pine?</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">BY AN OVERSIGHT.</head>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The specifications called for white pine.  The blanks for bidding submitted called for a bid on both yellow and white pine.  If you will look over the bods you will notice that is called for in all cases.  By the time the bids were received I had carried the investigation to that point and the summary of the bids that is given here and elsewhere was made entirely upon yellow pine, because at that time the <choice><sic>qustion</sic><corr>question</corr></choice> of yellow pine had entirely disappeared.  By an oversight it was still left in the specifications and copied.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;But all the contractors had the information that they might bid either with yellow or white pine?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir, and their bids are there on both kinds.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Are these the bids of the lumber dealers?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir; the contractors.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Am I permitted to ask some questions as we go along here?</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I presume so, so long as you don't break in.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;He has my full consent if he doesn't take too much time.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I simply want to know at what date these lumber bids were made or asked for?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The time of these bids, this yellow pine bid, was the 15th of July, I think&#8212;the 16th of July.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Why were these bids not submitted to the board&#8212;the bids for lumber?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Why were these bids for lumber not submitted to the board?  Because it was not called for, and there was nothing to require it.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;You said that you made a purchase.  At what price did you buy this yellow pine and how many thousand feet did you buy?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The price of yellow pine purchased was $14.50.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;And you thought at that time that that was $1.50 lower than you could buy it at any other place, from any other dealer?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I thought so.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Didn't you know that you could buy lumber at that time a dollar cheaper than $14?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;These bids explain that.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Why did you not report this purchase&#8212;the quality, quantity and price&#8212;to the board at any time?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Mr. Kountze, I think these matters have been fully explained.  There was no call for reporting all this.  These bids were taken for information, not knowing whether we would be called upon to buy the lumber or not.  When the bids were opened and found to be too high I then suggested that we purchase the lumber and have these bids as my authority as to where to go for it.  The lumber was purchased on the 24th.</p>
                            <p>Why was not the contract or the order for that lumber filed with the secretary for the information of this board?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I was never instructed to file that order.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;And you knew how many thousand feet you turned over to Creedon &amp; Mahoney?  How many?</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">HIS MEMORY DEFECTIVE.</head>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I don't recollect.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;You don't know how much lumber you bought?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I don't know exactly.  My memory is not quite as retentive as that on all the details.  The lumber that I ordered was somewhere, I think, about 170,000 feet.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I presume the office has a record of the quantity of lumber that was purchased?</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;We have no such record here with the secretary.  Have you ever heard how much was bought there?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;There was never any occasion to turn any order over, because the order in a few days was turned over to the contractor and he assumed it.  That is, the contractor paid the lumberman.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;At what price?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;At the price that I ordered it at&#8212;$14.50&#8212;$1 higher than I could buy it at the common size and common quality.  This quality was the highest quality obtainable.  It was sawed a quarter of an inch thicker than the ordinary size and tongued and grooved on a special design, for which the mill had to make their knives.  For these reasons, in order to get the requisite thickness and quality, I agreed to pay $1 higher per thousand.  Have I made that clear?</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;The lumber that was furnished was of a higher grade than the lumber that these bids were put in on?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Didn't you say to Mr. Kirkendall that you were saving the exposition from $200 to $300 on this deal because the lumber was $1.50 cheaper than it could be bought for from any other dealer?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;We will let you settle that with Mr. Kirkendall.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;As I understand it, the lumber which you purchased was one-quarter inch over stock size, so that it would dress down a full three inches.  And this lumber which you bought, was that some which was manufactured for this purpose?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Specially.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;Wasn't anything you found in stock?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir, it was ordered from the timber.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;I can understand readily how an extra thickness in the lumber would cost more, Mr. Rosewater, than stock size.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;But we were assured that we were getting a great bargain in buying this lumber cheaper than anybody would sell it for, and we were never taken into the confidence of Mr. Geraldine as to how much he bought, at what price he bought it or how much he turned over.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;You said about $3,000?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;That is about what it was.  That is the approximate amount.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;As I understand it the association, as an association, never actually bought this lumber, never paid for it?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;The contractor simply stepped in and took the contract which you had the option upon?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Which I had already ordered at the time the contract was made and which was supposed to be under way.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;And he stepped in and took it off the association's hands at the same price at which you had contracted for it?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;And which the association would have paid had they taken the lumber?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;And you submitted that proposition to turn over this lumber to only one of those bidders?</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">ONLY ONE BIDDER.</head>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir, only one, because it was not made until the final proposition.  I was not foolish enough to tell those contractors that we had ordered the lumber and put myself in that position.  The question was asked here some time ago.  Now, after these bids were rejected, I was surprised to find them so high; supposed it could be done for less.  I wanted to place it under contract.  I went over the specifications and drawings carefully to see if I could cut out any expense here or there.  I conferred with as good authorities as I could find on that class of work and I made some changes.  It is not customary in letting contracts to reject bids and ask for bids again on exactly the same specifications, because I contractor is not expected to alter his bid under such circumstances unless a change is made.  It is customary in such cases to call the lowest bidders.  In this case the two lowest bidders were Connolly and Creedon &amp; Mahoney. Connolly was the lowest bidder, having bid $7,900 on the entire job, as you will see by his original proposition.  There was another bidder, the third, Mr. Raymond.  I also called him in.  If you please, I will read what I dictated here.  (Reads.)</p>
                            <p>Now, it has been stated that Mr. Connolly turned in a proposition to do the work for $7,100.  That statement is absolutely untrue.  Here is his proposition.  Here are all the propositions he has ever offered.  It is stated here that he turned in a proposition to do the labor for $2,100.  That is also untrue.  I will read his proposition.  (Reads proposition.)  I explained to Mr. Connolly the changes that we made of changing the connection between the mainstay piles and the anchor piles to wire cables instead of stringers and of sinking a ditch one foot to be filled with clay and tamped and drive the sheet piling six inches.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;By what authority did you change those specifications?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;By the same authority by which I made them.  I was authorized to do that work by Mr. Kirkendall.  That is what I am supposed to be here for.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;All the bidders were aware of the changes in the specifications?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The three lowest bidders.  The bids received were: Hamilton Brothers, $11,542; A. A. Raymond, $8,724.38; Creedon &amp; Mahoney, $8,161.10; James P. Connolly, $7,900.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;That is on the first proposition?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;He says that this is false, that Connolly bid $7,100 for this work, and that it is false that he bid $2,100 for the labor.  Isn't it true that in his bid, on the face of it, you say that he offered to deduct $700 if he were allowed to do what you allowed Mr. Creedon to do?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;That is not true.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;You read it there?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;It is not there.  The modification we proposed for setting the piling in the ground was to sink a ditch one foot and drive the piling six inches, the idea being that by driving six inches we could get probably as good a job as by driving a greater depth.  I also decided that instead of sharpening the piles as shown here, to sharpen them on the side so that they would form a wedge on the sides.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Who made these plans?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I must ask, Mr. Kountze, that this gentleman be required to sit down and wait until I get through.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I think that Mr. Geraldine should have the right to make an explanation.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I explained that these plans were drawn by Thomas Shaw, Mr. Connolly suggested that instead of driving at all, if I would relieve him from doing any driving that he could put the piling in a ditch and fill it up so that it would hold water.  I didn't think so, and told him I couldn't consider it.  When he put in this bid, "if sheet piling is allowed to be set in a trench instead of being driven, deduct $700," it was on the proposition to do no driving at all, which we could not consider, and I distinctly told him so.  He then said he could make no deduction on that score and his bid stands at $7,800, and he refused to do it for anything less.  I had asked him the same as the others, to submit a proposition for the work, and for all the materials and the work, or for such portion of the materials as he could furnish to the best advantage.  This was his proposition.  There is the proposition I received from Creedon &amp; Mahoney.  (Reads.)  After receiving that proposition from Mr. Creedon, I asked him what price he had figured on lumber.  He said he had figured $13.50.  I asked him if he could buy lumber of the quality called for.  He insisted that he could; that he could get a good quality at that if he could have time to get it here.  I then explained to him that I had ordered the lumber, explained the specifications under which it was ordered, the degree of thickness, the better quality and the special design of the tongue and groove, and asked if he would be willing to take that order off our hands at that price and still do the work at the figure he had made.  He said he wanted time to consider that, went away, came back, and finally said he would do so.  I then reported this matter to the manager of my department and recommended that the contract be given to Creedon &amp; Mahoney at the figures named and under these conditions, and that the piling be let as a separate contract or done by ourselves.  I explained that the lowest figure I could obtain was 5 cents per foot for driving the piling and the other prices mentioned for driving the sheet piling.  Mr. Kirkendall asked me if I could do it for a less figure.  I told him I thought we could.  As a result of the conference I recommended that we do the piling ourselves, the contract to be let to Creedon &amp; Mahoney.  It went to the executive committee.  There was some criticism offered on the specifications.  It was on the day that Mr. Kirkendall left the city, I think.  Mr. Rosewater and Mr. Lindsay came to my office to get the specifications.  The criticism was offered, to which I replied and asked for a suggestion of something better, which was never offered.  Later the same proposition was presented to the executive committee by the president, who, in the absence of Mr. Kirkendall, acted as manager of this department.  I was called before the committee in regard to the matter, I was asked numerous questions in regard to it and explained every detail as far as was required.  Mr. Rosewater was present and asked some questions about it; asked me in regard to the cement mentioned and other questions.  I don't remember just what.  But I do remember that I explained all this matter, much of which I am explaining now.  In my presence the executive committee voted unanimously to award the contract to Creedon &amp; Mahoney, and instructed the acting manager to do the rest of the work ourselves.  I immediately proceeded with it.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;May I ask you&#8212;The cement was omitted in doing the work?  Had the cement been used, would it have added to the cost of doing the work?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;The puddling of the trench cost the contractor as much as it would have cost him had he used the cement?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, it cost him more.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;And the work without the cement is preferable to that with the cement?</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WAS SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN.</head>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir; I believe that it is.  At the time I drew those specifications I was somewhat uncertain about the matter and thought that possibly the use of a small amount of cement there might aid in some cases.  I
                            
                            <pb n="72" xml:id="TMISB03-072"/>
                            
                            was fearful of finding decomposed strata of clay or porous material that would not puddle.  In that case I also wanted to make a joint inside the sheet piling through this strata if I found it.  There was one stratum of that material found higher up in the clay which made me apprehensive of finding more.  I might explain that further.  Here is the contract of Creedon &amp; Mahoney.  (Reads from contract.)  You will observe that I state that the ditch shall not be more than five inches in width, the idea being that the narrower we made the ditch, without disturbing the clay at the bottom of the ditch, the better joint we could make.  This ditch being five inches wide, the plank would fill three inches, leaving only two inches to be filled.  I thought that possibly to fill the balance of that with American cement might be better than undertaking to tamp it.  I found on more careful examination of the clay that it is what is called joint clay; that is, porous, having perpendicular pores; that to break those pores it was better to do it by puddling it and tamping it.  Now, you will readily understand that if that ditch, two inches wide and only a foot deep, was to be filled with cement it would only require a small quantity of cement.  The cement was never intended to apply in any place except where I might find decomposed material.  The facts are that this ditch was dug a foot wide.  I found that in going on with the work, testing it, that a better job could be obtained by digging a ditch wider, puddling it and tamping, which was done.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;Was there any extra charge on the part of the contractor for that?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;He was not allowed any.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;Did he ask any?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;He did and it was refused.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;Was it refused before or after he did the work?  Did he make his claim before he did the work.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;He made it afterward.  Is that matter of the cement satisfactorily disposed of?</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I think it is explained in a manner that is intelligently understood by the committee.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Are there any questions to be asked about it?  It seems to be made a point in these charges.  I should be glad to answer them.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I think the question was asked whether the cost of doing it one way or doing it the other, which was the cheaper, whether there was any difference in the cost.  And I think the answer was that the tamping cost more than putting in the cement.  Is that correct?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir.  The work as done, in digging the ditch wider and tamping it thoroughly, as was done, is more expensive than putting in the cement.  And the cement was never contemplated except in such places as might be found porous and might be put in as a safeguard.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">FIGURING THE COST.</head>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I think it might be well perhaps to state to the committee what would have been the probable cost and quantity of cement that would have been required to have done the work if it had been done with cement instead of clay.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Well, the quantity of cement contemplated, the difficulties contemplated in encountering any of these stratas could not have exceeded more than $30 worth of cement in the entire job, under the worst conditions that we expected or anticipated.  Now, as to any preference being shown these bidders.  If any preference at all was shown it was in favor of Mr. Connolly.  As to the cost of the entire job, there is a statement taken from our books showing the cost of the sheet piling.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I understand, Mr. Geraldine, that on the question of these specifications you stated you drew them and you changed them.  Or, they were drawn by Mr. Shaw under your direction and changed by you?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir.  And here are the changes put on.  I have something to say in regard to Mr. Shaw.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Were you authorized to change the plans or specifications on any work of this kind?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;Do you mean previous to the letting of this contract?  For instance, here may be an architect or a landscape engineer engaged for a building or the laying out of grounds, etc.  Now, what I wanted to understand was, whether, after these plans had been made by an architect for a building or a landscape engineer in the laying out of grounds, as the case may be, had Mr. Geraldine the right or authority to change this in any manner?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The changes made were submitted with the revised, the later propositions and the recommendation to let the contract, in the same manner in which the first drawings were presented, and the authority granted by the executive committee, the order given by them, referred to them the same as to the other proposition.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Did you re-advertise the whole of this matter?  Did all these contractors have an opportunity to enter?</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">GROWS QUITE INSULTING.</head>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I have answered that question two or three times here, and unless Mr. Kountze desires it&#8212;</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I want to tell you that I am one of the managers of this concern, as well as one of the men who bring these charges.  You are one of our employes, and I am not to be insulted by being told that I am some side-show fellow, like some cheap lawyer.  I want the question answered so that for your own benefit you will have the opportunity to clear yourself.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I thank you that you are so much interested in my welfare, Mr. Rosewater.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;If you did not advertise the plans to the bidders, how did they know there was to be any bidding?  He stated that all of them were notified verbally to come and see these specifications.  I have had conversations with one of the bidders (I haven't seen Creedon &amp; Mahoney), and he may have lied to me.  He stated to me that several changes were made, of which he knew nothing, and he certainly knew nothing of this lumber being changed.  Now, I asked him as to the plans, for reasons.  Mr. Shaw drew those plans.  He is a civil engineer and is thoroughly competent to draw them.  They have been radically changed, and not for the better.  Now, what I wanted to ask is this: Why was it that the pile driving was done by the exposition rather than to leave it to any contractor under specifications that would require a fixed quality of work?  I do not know whether you want to answer that question or not, but it seems to me it is a very important one, because I will follow it up with another question.  Is it not true that in your office you have an employe and clerk who is drawing $75 a month who owns that pile driver and is doing pile driving on the grounds and is in partnership with another employe?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, that is not true.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Well, we will prove it before we get through.  Mr. Templeton does not make any secret of the fact that he owns that pile driver, does he?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I know that he does own the pile driver.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;And that he does the work on the grounds.  Isn't that true?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, that is not true that I know of.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Who does it, then?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;This work was done by our own employes entirely.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;What does Mr. Templeton do, then, with his pile driver?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Would you like to have that explained.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I think, as Mr. Rosewater has raised the question, it might be well to explain it.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I think Mr. Geraldine has said that the pile driving was undertaken on the part of the exposition because he found that the exposition could do it for a less amount than that which was called for on the bid of the contractors.  In what way was this purchase of piles made, on contracts?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The piles were bought.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Did you make contracts for them?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I gave verbal order for them.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;A verbal order?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;In some cases a written order, as the case may be.  I would like to explain that question also, as it has been raised.  When it was found that Creedon &amp; Mahoney made this low proposition, as before stated, and as you will find written in this statement, I asked the next man, A. A. Raymond, who was about the only regular pile driver who had appeared up to this time, to make a figure for driving the piles.  He asked 5 cents a foot for driving the mainstay and backstay piles.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Does that mean furnishing the timber?</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">THE PILE DRIVER DEAL.</head>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, we were to furnish the timber.  I thought we could do it cheaper as we had formerly been doing some pile driving on the grounds and had hired a pile driver of Mr. Raymond.  After deciding to do so I looked for a pile driver to rent and using his in driving the piles for the Manufactures building.  In making inquiries I learned from Mr. Templeton, one of the employes, that he had the greater part of a pile driver and owned the principal part of the machine.  I asked what he would let the exposition have it for and he replied that if we would take it and fix it up, pay for whatever was necessary to make it run, that we could have the use of it for nothing.  Or he would fix it up and rent it to us complete, as a first class machine for about $7 a day.  I had the work done.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;Did that include the engine?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Included everything.  I had the work done and the cost of the pile driver on this job, or of repairing it, amounted to somewhere in the vicinity of $80.  I do not remember just what, but can get it from the books.  It is included, however, in the items given here.  After finishing the work and turning over the machinery to Mr. Templeton what he has done with it is not a matter for me to be interested in.  I understand that he turned the pile driver over to a man named Green and he has been bidding on the pile driving since.  What is Mr. Templeton's interest in that pile driver I don't know and it has no bearing on the matter whatever.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Is Mr. Green in any way connected or employed by the association in any other capacity than that of driving piles?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir.  He was employed a few days before that time.  He was employed on the former pile driving when we drove the piles around the colonnade.  I again employed to take charge of the pile driving around the lagoon.  When he finished that work he left our employ.  I offered him $3 a day to come back to our employ, which he declined, and he drove, as a contractor, the piling on the Mines and Mining building.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;As a competitive contractor?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I suppose so.  I do not know.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;You have nothing to do with that?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir, notwithstanding the fact that it has been stated in the newspapers that we did the work.  As to the truthfulness of Mr. Connolly's statements, I understand Mr. Rosewater includes it in his charge; he stated that he made these proposals.  The answer I have as to whether or not he is a truthful man in his written proposal there, which I ask you to examine and compare with the statement in the charges.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">REGARDING THE LUMBER.</head>
                            <p>Now as to the quantities of lumber used.  The order that I made for piling for this lumber is somewhat different in some dimensions from this drawing.  This drawing shows a 3x10 for coping.  I ordered a 4x8.  If you refer to the specifications which I have been looking over, I see that it is specified in the original specifications as a 4x10.  Now if we go by the drawings, which are 3x10 and which I distinctly remember is what we agreed upon, it would be different from what is stated in the specifications.  In looking over the work I decided that 4x8 was ample, and ordered that from the Cady Lumber company.  Now, as to there being a difference of 60,000 feet of lumber, that statement is grossly erroneous and untrue.  You will observe that in the original drawings the connection; this shows the front side of the piling, where the water would be; that shows the sheet piling, there is the ditch and there is the six inches driven in.  There is the pile driven to give strength to it; here is the anchor pile driven back a certain distance and fastened to this as an anchor; there is the excavation behind to be filled and tamped.  In the revised specification, and you will notice I read to you in the contract, that we might at our option use wire cables instead of stringers, you will see that it is shown here that these piles are fastened together by a 2x8, the front pile fastened to the back pile by a 2x8.  The change from 2x8 was made in the contract to galvanized wire cable.  The amount of 2x8, as I roughly estimated it, which will be found nearly correct, necessary to make these connections as shown on the original drawings, would be about 16,000 feet.  These were eliminated and a wire cable substituted.  At the same time the distance between these was doubled.  You will see here the distance is shown as fifteen feet here and twenty-four feet here, but the distance for which twenty-four-foot piling was to be used is shown here.  There is the proportion that it bore to the whole job.  This is the profile drawing, showing the various distances, heights and depths.  A very small portion was made twenty-four feet.  Now I changed the specifications to put these anchors back, none of them less than twenty feet, most of them twenty-six feet and some of them thirty feet.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;That was done before the contract was let on the revised plan and upon which both Creedon and Connolly bid, upon the same specifications?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes.  Mr. Connolly both had that plan and both bid upon it.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;This change was not made, then, after the contract had been let to Creedon &amp; Mahoney?  And the cost of doing this kind of work instead of the other, was this way cheaper than it would have been?</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">COULD HAVE BEEN CHEAPER.</head>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir.  It would have probably been cheaper had the same distance been maintained, but moving back double the distance doubled the labor of digging a ditch.  The actual cost of doing the work, this was more than the other.  This timber first contemplated was very cheap lumber; could be bought for $12 a thousand, so that, as you will find in my written reply, instead of being a donation to the contractor, it was an additional expense upon him.  Now, it is further stated that the iron work was left out and the contractor was given a donation of $200 or thereabout in that manner.  I will refer to the contract.  The exposition reserves the right to change the manner of fastening the waling, to place the waling back of the sheet piling instead of in front and fastening to the piles by notching and mortising and toenailing, and the contractor agrees to make no additional charge should such a change be made.  In ordering this lumber I had looked over the matter sufficiently and made this change in Mr. Shaw's plan, and instead of putting that waling on the front side, next to the water, I put it back of the sheet piling and turned it edgeways, getting the additional strength of turning the plank edgeways and mortising it in.  Looking down from the top of the piling there is the sheet piling, there is the round pile and there is the waling, a diagonal mortise being put in from the back so that this waling was wedged in between every pile and would not come forward on account of the diagonal mortise and was toenailed in besides.  Now, if you will look at this cavity behind the sheet piling for a moment you will see there it shows this waling edgeways and in some cases it went back much further, projecting back close to the bank.  Now you will readily see that if this plank came back against the wall so much as it did in most cases that the earth behind there could not be tamped from above.  Therefore it would be necessary for the contractor to do that tamping to excavate behind here so as to get down.  That was something the contractor did not figure on.  That is why I put in this specification in the contract about placing the waling timbers back of the sheet piling instead of in front and fastening to the piles by notching and toe-nailing if found advisable and the contractor agrees to make no additional charge should such a change be made.  Now the fact is that the actual cost of putting in the waling in this manner as near as I can, estimate it was $200 greater than the original plan, including the iron work which is spoken of, and instead of being a donation to the <choice><sic>contratcor</sic><corr>contractor</corr></choice> was an expense of $200 or thereabout additional to him, for which he received nothing.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;There is another matter I did not quite understand.  The coping, as I understand it in the specification, was 4x10, in the drawing 3x10, and subsequently there was substituted for the coping a 4x8.  Now, <unclear/></p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">ONE MORE OVERSIGHT.</head>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Those changes were made before the contract was let.  That change was made when I ordered the lumber, as I ordered it 4x8.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;That change was made, then, before the contract was let to Creedon &amp; Mahoney?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir; it was fully explained to both bidders.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;And both contractors bid on the same proposition?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;And the difference between the drawing and the specifications was fully understood by both of them?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;As I understand it the specifications were originally drawn 4x10?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The specifications I find are written 4x10.  I presume it is a mistake.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;You claim that was an oversight?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, that was an oversight.  In making this contract instead of revising the entire specifications and noted here the changes we proposed to make and did not notice that the specifications read 4x10.  I presume that is an error and the lumber actually furnished was 4x8.  But that change was made before the contract was let and explained to both.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;Is it customary where a contract is let that the drawings govern or the specifications?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;They both govern, and if there is a discrepancy it is settled between the engineer and contractor.  Now, I have a word to say in regard to Mr. Shaw, whose letter was read here.  When I took up this work at the point of making drawings I made inquiry for a suitable man to help me with this work who might superintend it afterward.  I inquired of Mr. Andrew Rosewater, who recommended Mr. Shaw.  Mr. Shaw assisted me in this work and made these drawings.  He wrote a portion of the specifications, which I afterward revised, and I discussed with him the propositions of taking charge of this work when it was let and intended to put it in his charge if he was an applicant for the work.  On the day on which bids were received, or about that time.  I was told that Mr. Connolly was bidding in connection with Mr. Shaw and was in partnership with him.  This was later corroborated by a bid on the putting in of water pipe put in by Connolly &amp; Shaw.  I decided if that was the case and from my acquaintance with Mr. Shaw that I did not want him for superintendent on that work, and I did not employ him.  I will, if you wish, take his letter and answer it in detail now or hereafter, just as you like.  I simply wish to say that his statements as read by Mr. Rosewater are falsehoods.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Should the committee decide later that they wanted a definite answer to Mr. Shaw's letter which is submitted here they will probably call for such further information.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;Was there a distinct bid made by any of the contractors for this particular work?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;All the bids I received are there.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;What I am getting at is the cost of this work.  Is there a bid on that?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, I did not ask for a bid on that.  I simply asked Raymond what he would do the work for.  He said he would make me a bid on driving the piles and let me furnish them.  His bid was too high.  He asked five cents a foot and we drove them for less than 4 cents.  He also made a proposition on driving the sheet piling, 30 cents apiece for two and one-half feet, or 20 cents apiece on the modified proposition.  There are nearly 5,000 piles to be driven and you see what that would amount to.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;There are none of these bids here that contain any figures by which you could compare the actual cost with what was paid.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir; you will find it in my letter.  I will read it to you, if you please.  (Reads.)</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;You say that Mr. Connolley's bid was only $100 less than the original bid be made?  The original bid was $7,900 and you say that after you made these changes on these specifications he was only willing to deduct $100, and you mean to state that when you changed from white pine to yellow pine and gave him the advantage of $3 per thousand he still would not deduct more than $100?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I mean to state the fact just as I have stated it.  Mr. Connolley was not bidding on white pine.  Mr. Connolley understood that yellow pine alone would be considered, Mr. Connolley's original bid shows prices on yellow pine.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I am saying that when he made his original bid he was bidding on white pine and that proposition was to make a first-class lumber enclosure.  Now, then, you say he would not deduct but $100 in spite of the changing involving a difference of $3 a thousand on 170,000 feet of lumber.  Isn't it a fact that you did not show him any of these specifications; that you told him verbally only of a few changes?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;It is a fact that I had no specifications made at that time beyond what is shown here, and I showed him everything I had just the same as I showed it to Mr. Creedon.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I hope you will permit me to bring in the partner of Mr. Connolley and let him tell the story of what they were bidding on.  He is right here, and it seems to me that before we close this question we might as well get right to the bottom of it.  Of course his letter may be contradicted by statements.</p>
                            <p>(Mr. Shaw is introduced.)</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Mr. Shaw, in your revised bid, what was your bid on the revised plan for this work?</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">PLANS ARE CHANGED.</head>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;I will explain to you that at that time I was not a partner of Mr. Connolley, but I figured up his bids for him and understood all about them.  It was just after the bids were put into the department here that he made a proposition to me to go into partnership with him, which I accepted, when we were trying to get this job.  Now, to begin with, I made out the bid there, which amounted to $7,900.  A day or two after the bids went in Mr. Connolley came up to my office and I suggested that he should go up and see Mr. Geraldine and see how we stood.  Mr. Geraldine would not give him any satisfaction.  That is the report he brought back to me.  He was a little bit hot at Mr. Geraldine anyway; said he had up a $500 check there and thought he ought to be treated right and that Geraldine had about told him he couldn't get the contract anyway.  That is the statement he came down to me with.  I said: "You had better go and see some of the directors and we will try to get at this thing and see how we stand."  He went to Mr. Hussie and Mr. Hussie went to Mr. Kirkendall.  Mr. Kirkendall said he would see Mr. Geraldine, and I suppose he did.  At least, when Hussie had seen Mr. Kirkendall he said: "You go and see Geraldine and he will treat you right."  And Mr. Geraldine treated him first rate and used him as he ought to be used.  I think it was the very same day, I am not very sure, but at any rate Mr. Geraldine told him to make over another proposition; to look it over and see if he could not cut down his original estimate.  And the second proposition was, instead of driving the sheet piling, they would dig two feet and drive the six-inch point into the ground, and to give him a bid on that footing.  And the third was to give him a bid for the labor only, the exposition company supplying all the material.  Well, I went over everything with him again and we looked it up and I found that we could cut down probably $100 off our original bid, and I think we took off for the excavations and the driving six inches, so the bid stood $7,100.  I forget just exactly what it was for labor.  Now, that was all the information that I got from Mr. Connolley.  There was nothing about the alteration of the plans; in fact we did not know that the plans were altered until we happened to go up to the office one day, I think it was when the sewer contract was to be let, and we walked into the draughtsman's room and there we saw the altered plan.  We were thunderstruck with it and that was the first thing that we began to see that we had not been used right.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;That was after the second bid was put in?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;After Creedon &amp; Mahoney had got the contract.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;The time you speak of here as visiting Mr. Geraldine was at the time that your first bid had been under consideration, $7,900, was it not?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;I don't understand.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;You had a bid in, or rather Mr. Connolley had a bid in, for $7,900?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;And it was the time the first set of bids were under consideration that Mr. Connolley visited Mr. Geraldine to get information in regard to his first bid?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;When Mr. Geraldine told him that he wouldn't get the contract?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Subsequent to that new bids were taken from Mr. Connolley and from Creedon &amp; Mahoney, and didn't I understand from you that when you put this second bid in for this work, or rather Mr. Connolley, that he did not know what he was bidding on?</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">BID WITHOUT SPECIFICATIONS.</head>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;He was told verbally by Mr. Geraldine what to bid on.  I said this, that he was told to look over his original bid and see if he could cut his estimate down somewhere.  That we did by lowering that $100.  He was told also to see what difference it would make instead of driving the sheet piling two feet six, as called for in the original specifications, to cut a trench two feet deep and drive the point six inches.  Well, there was enough to cut off by doing that to bring the estimate down to $7,100.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Are you quite sure?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;Positive.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I understand you did not have any specifications when you put in this second bid?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;Nothing except the verbal explanation from Mr. Geraldine to Mr. Connolley, which Mr. Connolley brought to me.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I understand, Mr. Geraldine, that the specifications had been modified when this gentleman bid on them?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir, the modifications were fully explained.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;And did they have a copy of it, or was it simply verbal?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;It was verbal.  I simply explained to these bidders the changes that are embodied in this contract.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Mr. Shaw, doesn't this appear in your bid?  You say that in making your bid for $7,800 you bid to drive your piles six inches and to dig a trench and set them in?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;No, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;What did you say?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;On the bid of $7,800 we were going to drive the sheet piling two feet and six inches.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Well, but when you made the deduction of $700?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;When we made that deduction we were going to dig a trench two feet and drive the piling six inches, which made two feet six.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Isn't this the condition of your bid? If sheet piling is allowed to be set in trench instead of being driven, deduct $700?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;That may be the language of it, but the intention was to drive them in the six inches.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Wouldn't we have to assume that the bid was made and as written would be what you intended to do?  We could not assume that you should do something different from what you bid for?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;Well, you can take it in that form.  But the language there does not convey just exactly what was told us to be done.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;This fact is very explicit and certainly Mr. Geraldine or the association could not have required you to have driven those piles one inch under this proposition.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">COULD HAVE BEEN BY CONTRACT.</head>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;It could have been arranged in the contract easy enough, because it was a verbal understanding.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Well, but you must hold to your proposition, not what you might have done under other circumstances, but what you actually bid for.</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;There is no doubt that what I have given in black and white there is not just exactly what is wanted.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;It is exactly as you bid.</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;I understand that, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;And exactly as the association would have to consider it in drawing a contract for you to do the work, and, drawing it differently, I should judge that you would have been entitled to additional pay if they gave you additional work.</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;Well, I don't think there would have been any dispute about that at all.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Well, we will pass that.  What were the other questions here?</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;Were <choice><sic>your</sic><corr>you</corr></choice> present with Mr. Connolley when he made this arrangement with Mr. Geraldine?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;No, sir; I was in my office.  Mr. Connolley came down and reported to me.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;You are simply stating what Mr. Connolley told you?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;Yes, sir; that is right.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Do you know in this $7,800 bid whether you counted to furnish white pine or yellow pine?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;White pine, and I will tell you why.  We consulted with the lumber dealers here and we found that it was impossible for us to get yellow pine shipped in here in time to complete the contract at the date specified.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;How much higher was white pine than yellow pine at that date?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;I won't say, because that is just the answer we got and we wouldn't go any higher for it.  But yellow pine is cheaper than good white pine.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Have you any idea what the difference in price was or would have been?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;Well, I would say from $1 to $2 a thousand; that the yellow pine would be cheaper than the white pine, but I would not say exactly.  But I will tell you that our bid from our lumber dealer was $18 a thousand for white pine.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;The lumber dealers asked you $18 a thousand.</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;That was the price made by them.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;You figured on furnishing lumber that cost you $18 when you put in your bid for $7,800.</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Had you supposed you could get yellow pine, what would you have bid?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;We could not bid at all on yellow pine because they would not agree to deliver it to us at all in time to complete the contract.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Were you offered any lumber by the exposition association or by Mr. Geraldine?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;No, sir; neither Mr. Connolley nor myself.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;What quality of white pine was this that you were bidding on?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;It was to comply with the specifications.  The specifications did not call for any quality.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Will you explain the difference between the specifications as they are now, as you found them on the present work as done and what there was in the original as you drew it first and as you bid on it?</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">BAD WORK ON LAGOON.</head>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;I don't know what the present specifications are, but I had occasion to go out on the works a couple of weeks ago to see this new patent pile driver, and while there I just made an examination of the works to see how things were going.  And I found considerable alteration from what I intended.  The sheet piling itself, instead of being down two feet six, ranged anywhere from one to two feet below the surface of the ground; none of it exceeding two feet.  The coping should have been 4x12 and it is 4x8.  The circular ends of that coping were specified to be broad enough so as to dress twelve inches wide all around, but even in the eight-inch stuff it has not been made wide enough to dress eight inches, all around, and you will find in the center of the sticks it is only six inches.  There is no walling put on, the piling is being irregularly driven, so that they could not construct the work according to the plans I made.  The piles are all zigzag, some out and some in.  I saw several while there that were cut more than three-quarters through in order to line up the face of the piling and they are no good that way for if any pressure comes against those piles away goes the <unclear/>
                            
                            <pb n="74" xml:id="TMISB03-074"/>
                            
                            the irregular manner in <unclear/>es had been driven and they <unclear/>waling piece at the back of the <unclear/>ng and made a kind of attempt <unclear/>ve it into the piles, but it was the <unclear/>test looking thing you ever saw.  The rest of it was tacked in by a couple of nails, just nailed up.  Now the piles were specified to be not less than twelve inches on the head and eight inches at the bottom.  Seventy per cent of those piles don't run over nine inches on the head.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GERALDINE TALKS OF PILING.</head>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;You made a remark, Mr. Shaw, a minute ago that the work is not done as you intended to do it.</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;That is right, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Did you intend to do the work otherwise than called for by the specifications?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;As called for in the plans and specifications.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Then you state that the work as done now by Creedon &amp; Mahoney is not done according to the specifications.</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;It may be according to the new specifications, but not according to the ones we bid on.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;How is that, Mr. Geraldine?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The only difference in the work as done now and as originally intended is what has been shown in the explanation I have given, with the exception that the piling is set uniformly ten feet apart.  In the original design it was intended to be various distances apart, 9 feet 8 inches, 7 feet 8 inches, and in the very high portions 6 feet 8 inches.  In going over the work I found that to be unnecessary; that there was sufficient strength without putting the piling in so numerously, and put it in uniformly ten feet apart.  Don't know just what the difference would be, but probably would be twenty or thirty piles in all.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;What is there in this matter that Mr. Shaw claims, that the piles were so indifferently driven that in order to straighten up that work it was necessary to cut the piles down to such a condition that they lost their usefulness?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;That statement is untrue.  It is either the result of ignorance or willful falsehood.</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;I would be glad to take you and show you Thursday, or your representative, where I saw the piles.  I know where to go for them and Mr. Connolley was with me.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;In driving this piling, you understand it is necessary to get it back to the proper facing and up from the wall somewhat, and in driving the piling at the bottom of the wall, as in this case, the displacement was greater at the front side on the level bottom of the ditch than against the high wall, and of course the inclination of the pile would be to go that way.  Now, it is difficult to get the piling exactly lined in driving, so that sometimes to put a pile in the proper place it was necessary to incline it somewhat.  Then when we come to put on the anchors the pile was drawn into line by being drawn into place.  If it was too far this way it was turned with a jack and if it was too far at the bottom it was cut off.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;How many were too far at the bottom?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Very few.  There was one pile set so far out that the box above it would nearly cut the pile off to bring it to line.  After they had done this work I ordered them to remove the box because from its location the remaining part was sufficiently strong, and it was totally unnecessary to have anything more and it left a better finished job, by far, to cut it off.  But the factor of safety provided in this anchorage is very high.  It is probable, if it was not for the great length of waling, one pile every eighteen or twenty feet would be sufficient, but in order to get it absolutely safe and sufficiently strong I put the piling every ten feet.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Have you anything further to state as to this?</p>
                            </div3>

                            <p>Shaw&#8212;I was just going to say this, that a lot of those piles were driven down below the level of the coping.  I don't know how many, but a lot of them.  And there were little pieces, maybe two inches thick, put on the top to bring it up to the level of the coping.  In one case I saw two or three pieces put on the under side of the coping.  The whole strain, if any of that clay should move at all, the whole strain comes on the coping and it is held <choice><sic>ther</sic><corr>there</corr></choice> by a little two-inch nail going into the pile.  Those were specified to be wood lag screws and there was to have been none of those packing pieces at all.  I will say this, that it is a very dangerous thing to have.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;At one point on the lagoon there were several piles driven below the required level, but they were not driven below the point of anchorage.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Not below the point that the pile is anchored back?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No; in these cases I authorized the spiking of pieces on the top and pieces of planking were put on the top and spiked on and the coping was spiked to that.  Now, the coping goes in this manner.  (Describes coping from drawing.)</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;What is the fact, Mr. Geraldine, about using the spikes instead of lag screws, as Mr. Shaw says the specifications called for?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The specifications called for lag screws when we designed to put the waling on in this manner, on the front.  There is the end of the waling, and there is the lag screw holding it to the pile.  In this case all the protection the sheet piling would have would be the hold of those lag screws in the soft pile.  In the other case the waling is put in in this manner, mortised from the back side, so that it cannot move forward without bringing the piling with it.  In the other case it would only be necessary for it to pull the lag screws.  This is the more expensive method.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;What is the fact in regard to fastening the piling to the coping.  Would it be possible to drive that piling in in the manner which Mr. Shaw spoke of?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir?</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;The manner of your construction would not allow the catastrophe that Mr. Shaw indicated here?</p>
                                <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir.  Let me state that is this was loose earth with its natural slope, instead of the solid bank that it is, the pile is strong enough to hold it.  I was obliged to figure against the thrust of a loose bank of earth for this reason, that in the freezing and thawing this winter a portion of the bank might be <choice><sic>sluffed</sic><corr>sloughed</corr></choice> off in that manner and the piling forced to receive the entire thrust of that loose earth.  Therefore, I provided for that.  I found in looking over Mr. Shaw's drawings that he had designated only ten feet to put these anchors back.  Now, the natural incline of a <choice><sic>sluffed</sic><corr>sloughed</corr></choice> bank of loose earth would come in this manner to the bottom of the lagoon and would go beyond where he proposed to place the anchors.  For that reason I changed his plans, putting the anchor piles further back.</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;You will find it further in the longer piles.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;That is correct, but it is not sufficient in the short piles.  The anchor, to be safe, should go beyond the point at which the earth would crumble if it was loose; otherwise it would be no protection.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SHAW PRESENTS FIGURES.</head>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;I figured, gentlemen, that the lumber which was being saved from the method in which the work has been constructed and the plans we bid on are as follows: On the backstays there is 21,333 feet.  On the short sheeting&#8212;that is to say, they did not put it down two feet and six inches&#8212;that it amounts to 15,000 feet, and if it had been two feet it would have been more.  For the coping, it was originally 4x12 and it is now 4x8.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I understood you, Mr. Geraldine, to say that it was 4x10 reduced to 4x8.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The specifications show it.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;It would have taken twelve-inch lumber, then, would it, to give you the curve and finish ten?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, on the curve.  On the straight there would be nothing cut away.</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;The saving on the coping is 6,664 feet.  The waling, instead of being 3x8, is 3x6 and that saves 1,666 feet.  The mortise and tenon are only three-eighths of an inch and I don't think they are much good.  You might just as well have straight joints.  The plan shows them an inch and the saving on that alone is 5,1016 feet, making a total, with the cutting of a foot off the sheet piling, of 49,679 feet, and if you cut another foot off, which I believe it will stand, it is close to 60,000 feet.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Mr. Shaw, in your bid of $7,800 did you bid on a different specification from that on which Creedon &amp; Mahoney bid?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;I don't know.  We bid on the specifications that were there for the bidders.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Was there more than one specification?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;I don't know.  I prepared the specifications myself and Mr. Geraldine looked them over and altered some things in them.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Mr. Geraldine, was this piling which Mr. Shaw claims he figured on a foot longer than that which Mr. Creedon furnished?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The sheet piling?</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir; Mr. Creedon furnished the same length of piling that the original plan called for.  This is the sheet piling, you understand, that I ordered from the Cady Lumber company, and was the piling actually used.  That was ordered and the estimate made on the first plans.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;And was of the same length that Mr. Shaw bid on?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir; that is, you understand that there is very little of this that was put in full length.  It was ordered in long lengths and short.  A great deal of the piling was cut at ten feet, eleven feet, twelve feet, and thirteen feet, according to the depth of the lagoon, or rather according to the depth of the bank.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Was there a different class of lengths furnished by Creedon &amp; Mahoney than was contemplated in the original plan upon which Mr. Shaw claims that the original bid of $7,900 and subsequently $7,800 was made?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No; that was ordered before the distance of eighteen inches was decided upon for sinking the piling.  The greater portion of it was driven to the full depth and some lower, so that this piling is driven on an average more than two feet.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;The piling that is now in?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;In some places, there is a curtain location where it is short, where in cutting the lengths of piling to get the required slant that it was short and only went in the ground sixteen inches.  I found some that only went in sixteen inches, but there were very few pieces and in that case we required very careful work in the puddling and tamping to avoid leaking rather than incur the delay of waiting for more lumber.</p>

                            <head type="sub">THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS WRONG.</head>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Creedon &amp; Mahoney were offered that lumber?  Shaw was not offered the lumber, or Shaw &amp; Connolley?  Now what was the advantage to Mr. Creedon in getting the benefit of your contract over what Mr. Connolley could have bought the lumber for?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;None, whatever.  What Mr. Connolley could have bought the lumber for I don't know.  As to what the lumber would have been furnished in the market for, giving Mr. Creedon an advantage, when I asked Mr. Creedon what price he had figured on for lumber, he quoted a price lower than he actually paid for what he used.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Mr. Shaw, you say the price quoted to you for white pine for this work, tongued and grooved, was $18?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Who was your man who was offering the lumber?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;The Wyatt-Bullard company.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Did you try any of the other lumbermen?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;I don't know whether Connolley did or not, I did not.  I was going to say, gentlemen, that in addition to the lumber bill I have given you, there will be fully forty-five piles saved in that job.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;What was the value of each pile driven?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;Oh, it was worth a dollar, anyway; at least that.  And the bolts were done away with, and I figured up that the price of that wire and putting it on would not cost as much as the bolts and boring of the holes for putting the bolts in.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Mr. Shaw, wasn't Mr. Connolley informed that the change had been made substituting wire instead of wood, and that he bid with that in view?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;I will tell you honestly, I don't believe it, because Mr. Connolley and I, the first information we knew of it, was when we went up into Mr. Geraldine's room there to look up the sewer contract.  We walked in to the draughtsman's table and there was the plan with this new section on it, showing this wire and everything else that we had never seen before; never knew a thing about it before.  That is what made us begin to think there was something wrong.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;That is, you did not know when you put in your revised bid that this wire binding to the stay-tie was to be used instead of wood?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;We did not.  Did not know it.  Was never thought of at the time.  All the alteration that we bid on was to cut that trench two feet and drive six inches, instead of driving two feet six inches.  That was the only thing we ever knew about the alteration of the plan.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The statement is untrue; absolutely false.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;Your dealer bid on white pine lumber at $18 a thousand, and that was the basis of your bid of $7,800?  If you  had known that you could have bought lumber, white pine lumber, tongued and grooved, for $14.50, would that have made a difference of $3.50 per thousand on your bid?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;Yes, sir.  We bid on the basis of $800 profit on that bid of $7,900.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;If, as a matter of fact, you had called for a bid from Mr. Hoagland and had received an offer to furnish this lumber, white pine lumber tongued and grooved, at $14.50 instead of $18, you would have reduced your bid that much?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;Yes, sir.  We were content with that margin of profit and we could have reduced our bid.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;As a matter of fact Hoagland did offer to furnish the offer for that money?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;He did, but we did not know it.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Were you aware that this work was to be done in yellow pine, could you have taken that contract at that time and filled it by September 10, as proposed, in yellow pine if that had been accepted?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;We could not get the Wyatt-Bullard company to say that they could get us the stuff in time to finish the job.  We had an option to bid on yellow pine, but we did not do it.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;And you did not know anything about the purchase the exposition made from the other lumber company and that was turned over to Mahoney &amp; Creedon?</p>
                            <p>Shaw&#8212;Did not know a thing about it, neither Mr. Connolley nor myself.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">PURCHASE, BUT NO CONTRACT.</head>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I want Mr. Geraldine to state as far as he knows, expressed in quantity by feet, of lumber purchased by the exposition and turned over to Creedon &amp; Mahoney.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I don't recollect.  I judge it was about 170,000 feet.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Mr. Geraldine, in order to make that point clear, did the association buy any lumber and pay for it, or did they simply make a contract for lumber and transfer the contract to Creedon &amp; Mahoney?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;They made a contract for lumber and transferred the contract.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;They never made the purchase?  They never received the lumber themselves?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;But they did make a contract by which they were to take a certain quantity of lumber, and that contract was referred to Creedon &amp; Mahoney, and that was probably 175,000 feet?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir; in that vicinity.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Now, you have that contract?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;There was no contract.  It was a verbal order, and a pencil memorandum of the amount of lumber required.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Have you no agreement in writing by which the lumber company fixed the price in writing at which that lumber was to be delivered for the exposition?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;You stated that the lumber was bought at $14.50 per thousand?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Was that all the lumber used in that lagoon?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;How much other lumber was there used?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I should judge that&#8212;I don't know how much.  The contractor had to get more&#8212;probably 20,000 feet.  I don't know.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Is that also yellow pine from the same yard?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Furnished by the same people.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;So that, all in all, there would have been 195,000 feet used in the lagoon in its construction?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Somewhere in the vicinity of 200,000 feet.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="75" xml:id="TMISB03-075"/>
                            
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Now you stated that the piles and the driving of the piling was $779?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;That, with the lumber got, was all the material used in the lagoon, was it not, and included the labor of driving the piles?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I do not know as I understand your question.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;The piles driven by our own people and bought by the exposition, together with 195,000 feet of lumber which Creedon &amp; Mahoney purchased and supplied, was all the material used in that lagoon, was it not?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, I think not.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;What was there besides?  I am talking of material now.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;There were cables for anchoring the posts, the nails and the white lead or paint that was used.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;How much white lead was used?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I do not know.  It was put on the west end of the lagoon for about half or two-thirds the distance around.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I notice that in this bill (I presume it is receipted) the amount charged as the cost of piles is $345.89 and the labor is $419.40.  In round figures, then, the labor which the exposition has bought is equal to $400.  Now, Mr. Geraldine, you stated yesterday that Connolley offered to do the labor for $2,800.  Is that correct?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I think his bid shows that.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Did that include the work of pile driving and completing all that work?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;His bid will explain.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I have not examined the bid, and I want to know that because I want a clear idea of it.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">ADDITIONS AND DEDUCTIONS.</head>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, I think his bid included all the labor.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;So that, deducting what you have paid already, say $400, there would have been only $2,300 to add for Mr. Connolley if he had done that work under his bid?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I think there is about $80 of that that was paid for the use of the pile driver or for repairing.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Is that charged to the labor?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I think so. It is included in the complete work.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;The reduction was about $80?  That would make the computation of labor equal to $2,380, the whole labor.  I am talking about separating the materials from the labor.  The 135,000 feet at $14.50 per 1,000 would be equal to $2,827.50.  To that should be added for piles and pile driving together $779.93, and the estimated labor for which it could be done or bought of Connolley we would put at being equal to $2,380.  I want to ask now how much, in round figures, the value of the white lead, the nails and the anchoring <choice><sic>yould</sic><corr>would</corr></choice> be in round figures?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;About $400.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;We will place that at $400.  But you are aware, I suppose, that only a very small part of the work was leaded?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, I didn't say so.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;That is the way it is represented to me.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I did not represent it so.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Very well; we have then a general computation as regards what the cost of this work would have been had the exposition bought the material as it had originally done so, paid for all the labor and completed the work on its own account.  Did this bid of Connolley's of $2,800 include the original specifications or was it on the modified specifications?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Will you repeat the question?</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Was the bid of $2,800, for labor, made by Connolley on the original specifications or on the revised specifications?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;On the modified and revised specifications.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Now the contract that was made by this exposition right here does not show anything as to the depth of the sheet piling to be driven or the changes that were made, does it?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;All that is shown on the plans.  In lieu of driving the sheet piling as shown in specifications, the contractor is allowed the option of sinking a trench one foot in depth and not more than five inches wide on the line of said piling, the piling to be driven six inches below the bottom of this trench.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Now, was there any change made in this contract at all?  I mean, this is the contract exactly as it was made, is it not?  No change made after that?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;In here it says the material to be used was to be white pine; was no change made?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;That was explained last night.  If the committee wishes me to go over the ground again, I will do it.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I have examined this today and the specifications call for white pine clearly.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I believe the reasons were given last evening why yellow pine was substituted for white pine.  If it is material Mr. Geraldine can state it again.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;It will probably appear, then, because you will have a copy of all that was said.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">CONCERNING PINE LUMBER.</head>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Perhaps a little more enlightenment on that might be well.  Mr. Rosewater stated that the specifications called for white pine, clear.  Sheet piling to be of white pine, sound, free from sap, loose knots, shakes or cracks.  That is not clear.  Clear white pine would be worth from $18 per 1,000 feet upward, as near as I can recollect.  In order to get clear white pine it would have to be made a special order, which would take considerable time to fill.  It could not be dried by steam, as the southern pine is dried, because they do not use that process in the north, and to air dry it properly would take a month.  Besides it would be too expensive and the only advantage gained in using this clear white pine would be its durability.  Now, No. 1 yellow pine, which is under the same classifications here, the restrictions as to quality are more severe and it is a better class of material as far as defects are concerned.  And after specifying white pine and looking up the matter very thoroughly I found, as before stated, that it was undesirable to use it at all and at the time I settled the question it was out of consideration altogether.  We considered it at all times, as appears in the form of bid as given to contractors to bid on, in which they were requested to bid on yellow pine.  Now, there may be some misunderstanding as to the prices quoted here last night.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;If it was understood that they were bidding on yellow pine, why was the contract filled in calling for white pine?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The specifications as first prepared called for white pine.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;I understand this is the contract made subsequently.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;In the contract it does appear, but in correcting the old specifications first made that was overlooked and was not taken out.  But it was not considered at any time and these bids will show you that we took the figures on yellow pine as the basis of the bid.  Now, for instance, here is Creedon &amp; Mahoney's bid.  Notice in the tabulation of the bids we give their figures as $8,161.  That is the figure on yellow pine, as you will notice by the tabulation, and in the other tabulations we took the figures on yellow pine only; did not consider the figures on white pine quoted; no intention of using it, and there was not a contractor who figured on this work or talked about it afterward but what thoroughly understood that yellow pine was what we intended to use.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;May I ask you whether it was understood by Connolley that he was to use yellow pine?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir, and he bid on yellow pine.  His last proposition was on yellow pine.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;That was the proposition under which the contract was let?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Are you not mistaken about that?  I asked you whether you were not mistaken about that statement that Connolley's bid was on yellow pine.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I have made that statement distinctly here several times, and I am not apt to be mistaken in a positive statement of that kind.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;You made the statement here also that this purchase was made of the Cady Lumber company with the idea that we were saving $1.50, or about that, per thousand?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I made what statement?</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Was it not stated to the board at your instance that we were saving at least $1.50 per thousand in purchasing that lumber?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;It was stated by you that I had said so, but it was not true.  I did not make that statement.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;You did not make that statement to Mr. Kirkendall?  Mr. Kirkendall invented that story?</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">EVADES THE QUESTION.</head>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Now there seems to be a misunderstanding in regard to that matter as far as Mr. Kirkendall is concerned in it which I wish to make clear to the committee.  In my written statement here, if you have read it over, you will recollect I stated that the bids were opened and rejected.  I explained to Mr. Kirkendall that it would be wise to order this lumber in order to get it under way, as I wished to get a perfectly clear quality of lumber, the best we could get of yellow pine.  I wished to have it specially prepared, on a tongue and groove design I would furnish.  I wished to have it thoroughly dried by steam, wished to get a perfect quality, and I wished to have it sawed one-quarter of an inch thicker than the regular stock, in order to get the fullest strength of the three-inch plank.  I said that in order to get this special order through in time it would be necessary to order it now, at the time.  I also stated that if I put that in the specifications or asked the contractor to furnish material of that particular kind it would probably add two or three&#8212;if I remembered correctly, add considerably to their figures in estimating, while I believed, and corroborated that belief by calling up the Cady Lumber company (he and the representative of the wholesalers at Kansas City came to the office and discussed the matter there) that they would furnish this lumber on that special order for $14.50 per thousand.  To get that lumber ordinarily or get it through a contractor's bid would probably cost $2 or $3 more on a special order.  But by ordering it now and getting what we wanted at that figure, which was the common price, it would be a considerable advantage to the exposition and would make a material difference in the cost of the work as compared with calling for new specifications.  The saving to the exposition company was there.  It is possible Mr. Kirkendall may not have gotten that idea clearly, or he may have expressed as a saving to the exposition of $1.50 per thousand, which would be correct, but not in the market price of lumber; but in the quality and dimension.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Was that lumber planed on both sides?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;What was the dimension of that lumber when delivered here at the lagoon?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Scant three inches.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I will now bring in a gentleman and present you with a sample of the lumber to show the board just what we did get.  I will introduce Mr. Mulhall, who was formerly employed for a great many years in Mr. Hoagland's lumber yard.</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;I was in the employ for the last seventeen years or more of Gray, and Mr. Hoagland part of the time.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Was Mr. Mulhall brought here as an expert in the lumber business?</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;No, I told him to go out there and get a piece of that lumber, and I wanted to show him that he went out there and that he compared it with the other lumber in the lagoon as to its size.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;We will hear what Mr. Mulhall has to say.</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;All that I have to say is that I measured it and compared it, and that is what I would call one of the best pieces I saw.  There were not many pieces around.  I was requested to bring in a piece and I was also requested to measure it.  I was told it would measure three and one-fourth inches and here it is only two and three-fourths.  Another thing I wish to say about it, that for that purpose this lumber is too dry.  We sold out of Mr. Hoagland's yard down there; we supplied the bridge company with this kind of lumber for their floor in the Council Bluffs bridge, but it was not tongued or grooved in any shape or form, and the life of it then, even with the sap in, is only from three to four years with the wooden block on top of it, even after being tarred and felt laid on it.  And the life of this for the business this is used for out in the lagoon, it is not the kind of material that should be used at all in my estimation for the use against the water there.  With the sap in it, it would be a great deal better.  The tongue and groove of course is in addition to that, but it would be also better if it was undressed for that purpose, in place of being dressed.  And then if it is like what I have seen there in the face of it, it is very knotty and it would not be taken, it would not be allowed, it could not be used for any other purpose except there.  I would not call it No. 2 even.  It wouldn't be accepted; it could not be sold in any market in the country only at a lower grade than what it is there.  That is all I can say.</p>

                            <head type="sub">POOR QUALITY OF LUMBER.</head>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;That is an average piece in thickness?</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;It is just two and three-quarters as it is now.  I took a square from one man and measured it.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;Is that the average?</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;That is the same thickness of all the lagoon, I went along the edge and took a square and measured the tops of the planks and they all only measure two and three-quarters.  I have no interest in the matter in any shape or form, but was simply asked to go out there and asked to bring in a piece for this inspection.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;I understand you to say that that is better than the average?</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;No, I took a saw, sir, and cut that off a piece that was there.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;Didn't you state that the average lumber there was not as good as this piece?</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;No, sir, that is, it is not free from knots.  But you go along the face of the lagoon down and you will find that the lumber is very knotty and when it dries out a little those knots are apt to loosen and fall out.  Then there is another thing in relation to putting it in there in water.  These grooves here should have been all leaded.  They should at least be painted inside, or white-leaded inside just as they were put in.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;What would be the life of that in the water after being leaded?</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;I would not swear to it, but I would not put the life in water at over two years, or two and a half, for it is dry and as soon as it takes the water it will rot very quickly.  There is no sap in it in any shape or form and when the sap is out of it, in the water it is of no use.  It is never used in the market for cisterns or anything of that kind.  It is all right for inside work, but where it is exposed to the sun or the weather outside, or water, it soon warps and gets all out of place.  It is good enough for flooring inside when it is kiln dried, or anything like that.  The majority of this stuff is used to cover areaways or the like of that brick, perhaps, is put on top of it or where there is stone.  It is sometimes used to go over sidewalks in areaways.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;What has been your experience in that class of timber?  Have you had any?</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;Sir?</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;What has been your experience in using this lumber?</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;No experience, only what I have seen.  I have seen it in the bridge, as I say, down here, fully three inches thick, undressed, and I have observed the life of it there, where it is covered with wooden blocks and tarred and tar felt put on it.  The life is only from three to four years.  None of these firms ever kept a large supply of this on hand, for there is no call for it.  Mr. Hoagland supplies the bridge company with it, but he only keeps a small supply on hand.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;If placed in water would that cause it to decay quicker?</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Have you had any experience?</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;No experience.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Then you do not know, except what you heard?</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;I never saw any of it used in water in that way.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;That is simply an impression without any knowledge?  It is simply your belief?</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;It is only a very few years in the market here, inside of the last eight of ten years, that this yellow pine has come into the market at all.  Very few of these western firms here carried it until the last eight or ten years and none of this grade
                            
                            <pb n="76" xml:id="TMISB03-076"/>
                            
                            or thickness.  It is used now for drop siding and for flooring and inside finishing, but none of it for outside work.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Didn't you state that to place that material in the lagoon in the water, that it would last only two years, or three at most?</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;That would be my opinion, seeing the life of it here in the bridge.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;You have had no experience with this timber placed in such a position as this is placed, have you?</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;No, sir.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SAMPLE BETTER THAN AVERAGE.</head>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;How does it come that there is no corresponding tenon on this side of that stick?</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;No what?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;It is only a portion of the plank.  If it was a full sized sample it would be twelve inches wide.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;Why didn't you cut off a piece of the full width?</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;There was none there.  There was not a short piece at all that I could find to cut any off from.  There is none around the lagoon that is anywhere near the width of that in the lagoon.  This is the only piece I could find.  I could have fished out a wet piece, but I had nothing to do it with.  I went all around and then borrowed a saw from one of the carpenters to get this.  It was the only stick I could find, and as I was asked to bring a piece, I brought it.  I measured the others to compare with the thickness of this, and it compares in thickness; is the same thickness all along.  It is all two and three-quarters.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;That is a fair sample, then, as to the thickness, and you think it is a fair sample as to the quality of the plank?</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;It is an extra sample as to quality, I would call it.  It is better.  That is, it looks better than the most of it that is in the lagoon to see the face of it just as it is put up, for you to take this stick all through and it was free from knots, and there is a great deal of it that is knotty.  And then it is cracked, just the same as this is.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Do you know whether this is a piece of lumber that was shipped here on the first order, or a piece of the portion that was supplied to fill up the deficiency afterward?</p>
                            <p>Mulhall&#8212;I don't know anything about that.  All I know about that is that I went out there today at 2 o'clock and got this on the grounds there; cut it off of a stick that was there and fetched it in.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;I would like to have you state whether the contractors, Creedon &amp; Mahoney, knew at this time that three and one-quarter inch lumber was expected to be used.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;They did not.  It was not mentioned in the contract.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;What was the date that you made this purchase of the Cady Lumber Company?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The 24th of July the verbal order was given subject to the approval of the committee.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;What was the date of advertising for bids for this work?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I do not remember, but it must have been about ten days prior.  I should judge that it was about the 14th that we advertised for bids.  Then after advertising for the bids, receiving the bids, finding them too high and recommending their rejection, to prevent further delay, knowing that it would take considerable time to get the lumber, I then recommended the order to be given, with a view to using it if we put the lumber in ourselves or turning it over to a contractor if we contracted the job.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;What was the date, do you remember, these bids were opened?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The 24th of July.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;And five days later, I believe, the contract was let?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The 13th of August the contract was dated.  It was some time before that it was let.  Now, a word about this lumber.  You will find in my written statement I say that this lumber is the best lot of lumber I have handled for years.  If the committee wish to be satisfied on that I should suggest that they examine it or send some one on whose evidence or knowledge they can depend.  As to the thickness of the lumber, it shows.  Yellow pine lumber when it is cut green, prior to the process of drying by steam, will shrink under that process on a three-inch plank ordinarily a quarter of an inch.  This lumber, I should judge from examining it when it came, at the time it was run into the steamer and kilned would have measured fully three inches.  When it came here I measured numerous pieces of it.  It measured scant three inches.  Scant three inches in anything over two and seven-eighths inches.  The ordinary lumber put through the same process, of the ordinary dimension, that this has gone through would measure a quarter of an inch less.  That is the difference that was to be made in the sawing.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Then would I infer from that, Mr. Geraldine, that this beam, two and three-quarter inches, is not a piece of the lumber that was taken under the first contract?</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">CANNOT ANSWER THIS.</head>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I am not prepared to say whether it is or not.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;This measures only 2¾ inches?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;That is all.  I could not say whether that was the lumber that was used to fill out with or whether it was a piece of the original stock.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Was there any difference in the thickness between the lumber that was given under the contract made by you and that which was furnished to supply the deficiency?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Unfortunately, there was about a quarter of an inch.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Then the lumber in the lagoon is not all of a thickness?  It is either heavier or lighter?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;There are two classes in the lagoon, one thicker than the other.  I an inclined to think that that is a piece of the original order.  I do not know whether it is or not.  I cannot say.  But it has been very thoroughly sundried after being steamed and is shrunk to its smallest contraction.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Now, Mr. Mulhall stated that that lumber in water, as it would be placed in the lagoon, the life of it would be only two or three years.  Have you any experience with lumber of that class under those conditions?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir; I have handled yellow pine lumber and used it in engineering works for a great many years, used it as long as twenty years.  This lumber placed in that lagoon as it is now will last for ten years in the water.  It will last longer.  There was a prejudice, and there is yet a prejudice against the use of yellow pine in this country, which was promulgated and encouraged by those interested in the sale of white pine, and it only came into this trade when white pine became so scarce as to give it the advantage.  Being used more and more every year, that prejudice is fast disappearing.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I want to ask Mr. Wakefield, as he is an old lumberman and understands, I want to ask him whether this sized lumber is what is classed as three-inch measure lumber.  It has been stated here that this lumber originally was 3¼ inches; that it has been ordered as such and delivered as such, but it is now 2¾ inches.  Now, what do you know as to the probable shrinking and planking?</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;I have no means of knowing what it originally was, but if it is 2¾ inches it need not have been over 3 inches to dress 2¾.  But if 3-inch lumber were ordered without any further designation, that is to say, 3-inch lumber, dressed on one side, then it would come 2 5-8 thick, because 2-inch lumber comes 1 5-8 and 3-inch lumber would come 2 5-8.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;After what kind of a drying process?</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;Either air drying or steam drying.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Did you ever handle any steam dried?</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;And was it thoroughly dried?</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;What did you find the shrinkage to be in a three-inch plank?</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;I could not say, because I did not handle it until after it was dried and dressed, and then it came to me.  Then, I say, a two-inch plank, as it comes to this market, after being dried and then dressed, measures one and five-eighths inches.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Shrinks three-eighths of an inch.</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;Three-eighths.  Whether it shrinks or it is the dressing I cannot say.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;That is two-inch.</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;Yes, sir.  If you would order a three-inch plank dressed one side without further designation than just that order you would not get it thicker than two and five-eighths inches.  If it had to be a special thickness it would have to be so specified.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;On three inches there would be a greater shrinkage than on two inches, and you say&#8212;</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;I don't say anything about shrinkage.  I say what two-inch lumber is in this market or what three-inch lumber will be in this market.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Is the ordinary stock lumber that comes from the south dried by steam before shipping?</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;Most of it is either air dried or steam dried.  You would not on a special order, as this would be, ordering a lot of specially cut stuff to be shipped in a specially short time, it would not permit of the drying process to a sufficient extent to get the shrinkage out of it.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ON DRYING LUMBER.</head>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;How long would it take to thoroughly dry it by steam?</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;By steam?  Well, it would not take so long by steam.  you can dry it by steam in twenty-four to thirty-six hours of you have the proper process.  A three-inch plank it would take five days.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I wish to state of this lumber, that there was not any of it in the kiln less than two weeks.  Ten days was first decided the manufacturers time but they kept it in for that length of time.  I wish to explain something about steam drying.  You can take yellow pine lumber as it comes from the mill, put it in a southern steam drier and dry it so severely as to greatly deteriorate its strength.  You can dry it rapidly or dry it slowly by steam.  By drying it slowly and thoroughly you maintain the strength, don't destroy the fiber, but you give it greater strength.  That was what I called for in this case.</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;That statement is correct.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Have you any knowledge, Mr. Wakefield, of the life of yellow pine lumber in washed earth and in water?</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;Some little.  My experience has not been very extensive.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;What would be your judgment of a piece of yellow pine lumber, dried as that is, in water?</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;In water it will last twelve or fifteen years, at least.  The place where it would decay the quickest in my judgment would be, if the water was kept at a certain stationary height, at that point and higher up is where it would decay the quickest; not under the water.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;What would be the difference in time it would be likely to decay between the green pine, not dried, and dried pine?  Which would decay the quickest?</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;There would not be any difference about that.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;One would decay as soon as the other?</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;I think so.  I don't think there would be any difference about that.  But if you were going to make a tight piling, of course it is better to have it dry when it is put in, because then the absorption of the water and the consequential swelling would make it perfectly tight and keep it tight.  Whereas, if it was full of water when it was put in there would be no room for swelling to make the joints swell tight and remain tight.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;In your judgment, should that groove have been cemented?</p>
                            <p>Wakefield&#8212;Now, Mr. Wells, that is a question in practical politics that I don't feel competent to testify on.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I would like to furnish an explanation.  On the west end of the lagoon there is a variety of soils and substratums.  At the extreme west end I found the soil black to a great depth, in fact, we never got to the bottom of the black soil, and near the bottom we found a composition where it was turning into black gumbo.  Further up, at the east side of the basin, we found there had been a heavy fill made in some places and a variety of conditions.  I was doubtful to some extent as to whether I could make that soil hold water or not, and I therefore desired in putting in the piling to make that watertight if possible.  For that reason I specified paint in the tongues and grooves.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;At the west end?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I specified it in the contract without reference to how far it should go.  I was disposed, if I found it necessary, to use it the whole length.  Took more pains to drive the sheet piling at the west end closely together and to use nothing but what was as near perfect as possible, and to see that the joints were well painted.  I did not succeed in that very well&#8212;as well as I expected.  The idea of putting paint or white lead between the joints is to pull them close enough together so they do not separate at all and glue them&#8212;cause them to adhere to one another.  Now, my idea in that was to get that work done as quickly as I possibly could, get the water in it as quickly thereafter as possible and start those planks swelling by the action of the water as soon as I possibly could. I was defeated in that by several causes.  The railroad construction was interrupted and the lumber failed to arrive that was expected.  We had to stop work on this sheet piling many times to wait for lumber, which the Cady Lumber Company was trying hard to get up here, but was defeated in delivering owing to the famine of cars.  Now, when we got out of that part of the work and further up the lagoon, fully one-half the distance, lineal feet, I found that the clay that we were puddling and packing hard behind the sheet piling, it was satisfactory to me&#8212;it was watertight.  I saw no further use for using the lead or paint, because it did not seem to effect the purpose I was after, and I did not think it would be necessary.  So I discontinued the use of the paint.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">KOUNTZE TELLS OF THE SOIL.</head>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I will explain here in regard to the soil, having owned that property for a long while, that when I first knew that territory up there the west end of the lagoon was a swamp, commonly known as a slough, and at times was entirely <choice><sic>immpassable</sic><corr>impassable</corr></choice>; could not drive through it.  As you went further east it was at a greater elevation and the soil was good.  About the time of platting Kountze Place I graded a good many of the streets and the surplus earth that I had was filled about half way between Twentieth street and Twenty-fourth street, and that accounts for that loose earth that you encountered going through there.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, to counteract that effect I had pure clay drawn by wagons and strung along the lagoon to fill in back of the piles and tamped.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;The specifications call that white lead shall be liberally applied to the tongue and groove joints before driving.  Now, you stated that it had been omitted in the actual work to a considerable extent.  To what extent has it been omitted or what proportion of it?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Approximately one half.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Was there any reduction made for the white lead and the work from the contract price?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;We settled at the contract price.  In the construction of this work the contractor was required to do more than the contract calls for.  The exposition company was responsible for the delivery of the lumber and the contractor was obliged to stop several times to wait for it.  At the east end of the work the foreman for the contractor put the waling and caps on the sheet piling that was driven against the back walls and terraces.  It now stands there.  It was not a part of the contract.  The contractor had several claims of that kind which were discussed and considered and finally agreed to settle the matter by settling at the contract price.  I deducted nothing for the omission of the paint and he received nothing for the extra work that his men did or the expensive delay caused by our failure to deliver the lumber.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Were these facts reported to the executive committee or to Mr. Kirkendall?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir, they were discussed verbally with Mr. Wattles, who was acting manager of the department at that time, but no written report was made.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I want to call Mr. Connolly.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;You were one of the bidders for the work on the lagoon?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Yes, sir, I was one of the bidders.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="77" xml:id="TMISB03-077"/>
                            
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;And you submitted a bid under the first advertisement for the lagoon?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;And that bid, with all the others, was rejected.</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Yes, sir.  That is, I was told it was rejected.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;After your first bid was rejected did Mr. Geraldine ask you to make a revised bid, and on what conditions?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Yes, sir; he did.  I called on Mr. Geraldine, I believe it was the following day, or probably the second day, to ascertain who was the low bidder on this work, and he told me at that time that I was not.  He said for me to make up another bid, and he asked me for a bid on what I would do to provide all the labor for driving the piles and sheet piling, provided that the exposition company would furnish the materials.  He also asked me at that time to make another bid, to bid in another way.  That is, the same way really, only instead of driving the sheet pile two feet six inches in depth, to dig a trench around the lagoon and set the piling, the sheet piling, into this trench and drive them six inches.  Instead of two feet six inches, just drive them six inches, and what my figures would be on that basis.  I did that.  So he also asked me at that time to make a bid between the difference in yellow pine and white pine.  I told him then I did not think I could give him a bid on yellow pine, for the simple reason that I could not get any figures from the lumber dealers to guarantee to me that they would deliver the lumber by September 10.  I told him if I was not pinned down to the 10th day of September then I thought I could give him a reasonable figure.  But he warned me at that time to do nothing unless I could stand by it, and I concluded I would not do that, because the lumber people claimed they could not get it here.  I put a bid in on it that was probably a little high, but I could not furnish the lumber at that figure.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">NO TALK OF CHANGES.</head>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;If you had been given to the 20th day of September could you have done that work?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Yes, sir; I could.  One week was all I wanted on the yellow pine and on the white pine there was no question about doing the labor in that time, because I had lots of time and time to spare.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;When you made your second bid did you complete your bid and make your estimates on the original plans and specifications, excepting so far as you have stated here in relation to the depth to which the sheet piling was to be driven?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Yes, sir.  There was no other plans or specifications to bid from at that time, only the original, only just this verbal conversation that Mr. Geraldine and I had about digging a trench.  That was the only difference at that time.  There was no difference in the specifications or plans.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;There were no other modifications at this time between you and Mr. Geraldine than simply the question of digging the trench and setting the sheet piling instead of driving it?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;No, sir; there were no other modifications of the contract considered or spoken of.  Not at that time nor any other time.  The only difference was that originally the sheet piling was to be driven two feet and six inches and in this a trench was to be dug and the piles were to be driven six inches&#8212;set in the trench and driven six inches.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;There was nothing said about any other changes, nothing said about using yellow pine, nothing said about the manner of tying the piling back with wire, as was done?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;No, sir; no indeed.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;No drawing to show?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;No drawing.  No sir; I will tell you when I found that out.  The plans were identically as drawn at that time.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Being no difference <choice><sic>whateevr</sic><corr>whatever</corr></choice>, excepting as to the matter of the trench?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Yes, sir; just the trench.  The only difference was in driving the piling, or in setting in the trench and then driving six inches.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;And your bid in the second instance was for setting the piles in the trench as indicated by Mr. Geraldine, and driving them six inches?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Yes, sir.  There was both ways.  I bid to do the work according to the plans and specifications as originally drawn, and also on that bid, then put in another bid, really as one bid, stating that if allowed to dig this trench and set the piles in there and drive them six inches, that I would knock off $700.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Are you quite sure, now, that your bid provided for that?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Am I sure?  Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;For the driving of the piles six inches?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Well, now, as far as driving the piles I don't know.  Probably it was not in the bid, but that was the instruction that Mr. Geraldine gave me, and according to that instruction I bid.  If it is not in there it was meant for that.  There was no way to get out of it at all.  That was the instruction very explicitly laid down by Mr. Geraldine.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;It does not appear in your bid.</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;It doesn't?  Well, that was the intent of the bid.  The object was in driving them six inches; there is a bevel on the piling so that when you drive it this bevel will wedge it up against the next pile as it comes into the ground.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Your bid explicitly provides that it was not driven.  If sheet piling is allowed to be set in the trench instead of being driven, deduct $700.</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Instead of being driven two feet and six inches.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;You don't so explain it in the bid.</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;The plans and specifications do.  I bid from the plans and specifications.  My bid reads, I believe, "according to plans and specifications," and the plans and specifications provide for that.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">PROVISIONS OF THE BID.</head>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Did you have at any time when you were making out your bid, or after delivering it, any information that there would be any change made in the plans and specifications over those in the plans on which you bid $7,100?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;No, sir.  I had no indication whatever, or any idea, that there would be any change made.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Your bid for labor as you made it included all the labor and included also the driving of the piles, did it not?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;My bid provided for driving the mainstay piles, driving the sheet piling, driving the backstay piles and performing all the labor that was attached to the job complete.  And my bid for the labor, if the sheet piling was driven two feet and six inches, if I recollect it right, my bid was $2,800.  But if the sheet piling was allowed to be set in a trench, which was to be excavated two feet, and driven six inches, then my price on the labor was $2,100, making a difference in that trench of $700 for labor for me.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Mr. Connolly, you have a foot note here in your bid.  Will you please explain it?  You say, the timber to be delivered to me on railroad in the exposition grounds?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Providing that the exposition would furnish me the material I would perform the labor and they were to deliver the timber to me on the ground.  If I was to do the labor and not furnish the material, then I wanted the lumber delivered to me there, but if I had got the contract for furnishing the labor and lumber then I would have to provide my own material.  But that provides that if the exposition company would award me the contract for performing the labor I would expect them to furnish the lumber to me at the track at the grounds.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;That foot note, then, applies to your bid for $2,800 and not to your bid of $7,800?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;That is all.  To the $2,800 and the $2,100.  Just for the labor.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Was the question of the trench determined at the time that you made this bid?  That is, that it should be only a foot in depth and six inches driven, or was that done after?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;No, at no time.  The only difference was, Mr. Geraldine told me the day I was in his office that if he allowed a trench to be excavated two feet in depth what deduction will you make from your original bid?  That was all.  He told me to make a bid on that basis, that we dig a trench two feet deep and set our sheet piling in there and drive them six inches, to keep them solid and fast at the bottom; that is all.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;If you had been allowed to furnish white pine on the specifications as they were executed out here, could you have made any material deduction from the price that you did make?  You know what has been done out there?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;And you know what the difference is between the work as done now by Creedon &amp; Mahoney and the way you were bidding?  If you had been allowed to bid for the work as it is now done, have you any idea what difference it would be in value and what deduction you would have made from your original bid?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Well, now, I could figure it up in a moment.  I would say (this is not as near as I could give it exactly) that I could have made $700 difference.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Seven hundred dollars difference in what?  In the price you quoted the second time or the first time? You made the total amount of work and total amount of material at $7,900 in white pine on your first bid.  Now, you mean you would have done it for $7,200 with white pine, the way it stands there now?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Yes, sir, I do.  Yes, sir, I believe even I could go lower than that.  I tell you, gentleman, I would have been glad to deduct $18 a thousand for every thousand feet of lumber that was saved on that job, and still I would have a profit left.  My bid was on white pine of the first quality, which cannot be bought for less than $18 per thousand.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;Now, do you know?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Well, I cannot buy it.  I bid according to the figures that were quoted to me, that's all.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;First quality, you mean?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;No. 1; yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Now, let me ask you this.  If you had been offered this lumber for the work as now done at $14.50 per 1,000, how much reduction would you have made from your bid?</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WOULD HAVE BID LOWER.</head>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;You say if I was offered the lumber at $14.50?  Well, the difference between $14.50 and $18, $3.50 per 1,000.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;It is computed that there are 195,000 feet of lumber all told in the lagoon, and you say you would have reduced from that $3.50 per 1,000 if you had been offered that opportunity?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Were you ever offered that opportunity by Mr. Geraldine?  Did he ever offer you any proposition or suggestion as to where you could buy white pine lumber or yellow pine lumber at $14.50?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;No, sir; he did not at any time.  He did not give me much of a reply at any time,and seemed to want to cut me off very short.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Mr. Geraldine said he favored you more than he did Creedon &amp; Mahoney, and showed every disposition to help you out.  In what way did he show that disposition?  Did he give you any indication or intimation that you could go to any lumber yard in this city and buy lumber at $14.50?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;No, sir; he did not.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;You had on the face of your bid, you had there that you figured lumber at $19 a 1,000?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Yes, sir; I was figuring a little profit for myself.  I was buying it for $18.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;Mr. Connolly, did you have any bid for lumber from Hoagland?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;From Hoagland?  No, sir, I did not.  I did not have it from Hoagland in one way, and indirectly I did in another.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;Did you have any bid from the Chicago Lumber company?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;No, sir.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;If you had known that Mr. Hoagland would have delivered you white pine, tongued and grooved, at $14.50, and yellow pine, tongued and grooved, at $13.50, would that have made any difference in your bid?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Yes, sir, it would.  Just the difference between the price of $18 and the price they would quote me.  Now, that is honestly.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;If they quoted such a price as that to some other contractor who was bidding at the same time you were, their bid would naturally be lower than yours, would it not?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Yes, sir; I should think so.  I should judge so.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;Did you make any effort to ascertain what you could obtain lumber for from other places?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;I didn't get a bid directly from Mr. Hoagland, but I got a bid from <choice><sic>Mr-Bullard</sic><corr>Mr. Bullard</corr></choice>, at Twentieth and Izard, and I understand it is a branch office of the same company.  And I had Mr. Benedict get prices for me from several people on the sheet piling and on the mainstay piling, and I went myself to Dietz and Patrick, and Wagner &amp; Buchanan, and other persons, and their prices were just about the same; all about the same.  But there was none of them that wanted to furnish me the yellow pine in time to complete the work by September 10.  But the white pine I could get.  They would not guarantee it.  They would say, in all likelihood we can get it, but we cannot guarantee it, because the mills are pushed just now and there is a demand for lumber, and I don't know that we can get the yellow pine.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;What do you regard the difference between yellow pine and white pine?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Well, there is $3 or $4; $3.50.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;In your bid here you make only a difference of 50 cents.</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;That is true.  Supposing the exposition company would accept my bid and bring me to time on that date, they have a $500 check of mine here, and if I have to go into the market and am compelled to buy yellow pine at any price I must have a better price for it.  I have a $500 certified check here I have to protect.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;Here is a bid from the Chicago Lumber company, and also one from Hoagland, in which they make a difference&#8212;the Chicago Lumber company makes a difference of $1 per thousand between white pine and yellow pine, charging $1 more for the white pine than the yellow pine.  Mr. Hoagland charges $1 less for the yellow pine than the white pine.  These are two reputable concerns, and what I want is to draw out from you why they should make propositions to sell this lumber at these prices if there is $3.50 difference in the value of them?</p>

                            <head type="sub">GERALDINE GIVES ADVICE.</head>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Well, sir, I cannot understand that, unless they might have a stock of this lumber on hand, or where could they get it.  But you, nor I, nor anybody else, can go into the market today and buy white pine lumber for anyways near the price we can buy the yellow pine.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;We could that day, because there is the bid.</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Yes, the bid is there.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;There are reputable concerns?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;These bids don't show that it would be here in time to complete the work on that date.  Now the time was short.  We had three weeks and Mr. Geraldine told me to do nothing I could not stand by and if I had to buy yellow pine I would have had to pay a stiff price for it.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;I want you all to get clearly what my idea is on this.  That is, if you felt that way and some other contractor felt he was safe in offering to sell the timber cheaper he was in better position to get the contract than you?</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;That is precisely what we have alleged here; that Mr. Geraldine by giving another contractor the benefit of the $14.50 lot of lumber which the exposition bought and keeping that from the man, gave the other contractor the contract, gave him the preference.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;That statement is misleading and, I think, intentionally so.  I have stated distinctly that nothing was said to either contractor about this order until after his proposition was put in any more than to this man here.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Then why didn't you let this man know just as well as him and let him come to the front?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Is there any of the committee who does not understand what I say?  The gentleman is endeavoring to make the point that I told the other contractor of this order that he could have before his bid was made and that he made a lower bid in consequence, which is untrue.  I told the contractors nothing of this order until their last propositions
                            
                            <pb n="78" xml:id="TMISB03-078"/>
                            
                            were in.  This man being the lowest, Creedon &amp; Mahoney, I then took up the question of his material&#8212;asked him what the figured he would have to pay for the lumber.  He said he could get it for $13.50.  I then explained to him what I had ordered, its extra quality, its dimensions, its advantage of being ordered some ten days prior, and asked him if he could use that order on this bid.  He said he <choice><sic>didl</sic><corr>did</corr></choice> not think he could, but he would go and figure it over.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Then why did you make that contract September 20, giving the preference to the other contractor, without letting this man know that he could also have this lumber and without notifying the board of managers, who have something to say in this matter?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;That statement is also misleading and intentionally so.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;How do you measure my intentions?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Because, Mr. Rosewater, you are the individual who delayed the consummation of this contract a week or ten days after the proposition was sent in, and that extension of time was made in consequence.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;In what way?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;By sending ti back when it was presented by Mr. Kirkendall the last day that he was here.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;It was sent back by the board, not by myself.  We simply found fault with the wording, the verbiage.  But all the contractors should have had the same opportunity if the time was going to be extended.  This man should have had the same right.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;This extension of time was made after the recommendations were accepted.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;Did you inquire, Mr. Geraldine, of Mr. Connolly the figure that he was&#8212;on what basis he was figuring?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir, I did.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;Do you remember his answer?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;His answer was in a measure evasive.  He said $13 or $14.</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Gentlemen, if I am permitted to say a word, I want to deny that most emphatically.  Nothing of the kind ever passed my lips, because if I said it I would be telling an untruth when I would say the words.</p>
                            <p>Wells&#8212;And Mr. Geraldine did not say anything to you, asking about the figures you were making?</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">ASKED ABOUT THE PRICE.</head>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;Yes, sir, he did, and I told him $18 per 1,000.  When I told him that I could not get the yellow pine here he said, "who are you dealing with?"  I told him my lumbermen said they could not deliver it for me.  He said "They do not know their business."</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I will call your attention to the fact that the witness stated some time ago that I asked no questions on this point at all.  I would like to call attention to one point on these bids, if you please.  You will observe that at the bottom of the bid here Connolly quoted lumber at $19 and $18.  You will see the other bids make the same quotations as high as $24 and $20.  If you will read the bid you will see that we called for prices on materials in the bids, as well as a lump figure.  Let me read this, if you please.  (Reads.)  The figures made by Mr. Connolly of $18 and $19 per 1,000 are on this proposition for the material.  The rest of his bid explains that.  You can read it over.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Did you ever make a computation, Mr. Geraldine, of the cost of the materials under the contract which you made with Cady &amp; Co. and what the labor which you had intended to employ would cost, and compared them with the bids that you had?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Certainly I did.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Then how did you arrive at the conclusion that this bid of Creedon &amp; Mahoney was lower than what you could do it for yourself, or the exposition?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I did not arrive at any such conclusion.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Then, if you did not, why did you recommend that we should let that contract to him at that price?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Because I was ordered by the executive committee to let the work by contract.  Not to do any more work ourselves than we could possibly avoid.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;And you knew at the time that we were overpaying nearly $1,000, or thereabouts, on this work?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, I did not.  I did not say so.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;You did do the work of pile driving, did you not?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Was that necessary?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;It was ordered so.  On my statement that I made&#8212;</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;On your recommendation?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir; I made no recommendation on that, I stated that we had an offer of 5 cents a foot for driving the piles, but I thought the exposition could do the work for considerably less.  I also explained to Mr. Wattles, who was then manager of the department, that I still thought these bids too high, and the exposition could save money still by doing the entire work themselves if they wished to do so.  He asked me how much.  I said probably, as near as I can recollect, $700 or $800.  Well, he said, that is not any more than a contractor's fair profit, and even though we might be able to save a little money that way, there is so much fault found with doing the work ourselves, so many people kicking about it, and the executive committee desires the work done by contract, and I would therefore say don't do it.  Let it go by contract and do only that portion which you have explained.</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;About the change of these specifications.  I want to state when I first discovered that.  There was some bids called for for the construction of a sewer on the exposition grounds, and me and Mr. Shaw went upstairs here to look the specifications over, and while we were in there I noticed the plan of the lagoon lying on the draughtsman's table there.  I went over and looked at it and saw there was a great change took place.  I said to Mr. Shaw: "Keep your eyes opened; something has happened since we were here before."  We went and looked it over carefully and there was a great change in it.  I did not like that at all, and I spoke kind of loud&#8212;not exactly loud, but I was pretty hot, and I showed it, and I said: "I will never put in another bid to the exposition company if the bids are not opened in public," because I did not believe in this transaction of opening bids behind closed doors.  I believe I was the low bidder on the lagoon out there, and I shall never bid on their work again until they are opened in public.  The next day Mr. Shaw asked the draughtsman if the bids were to be opened in public, and he assured Shaw the bids would be opened at 6 o'clock the next night in public.  I was not there, and Mr. Shaw brought a bid up there, and I believe Mr. Geraldine told him at that time, for Mr. Shaw told me.  He said that if he had me upstairs then he would wring my neck downstairs.  And I want to give notice right now&#8212;</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;I certainly must object.  What Mr. Shaw told you don't go.  When did Mr. Shaw go into partnership with you?</p>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;The first job that Mr. Shaw and I bid on together was on that sewer in the exposition grounds.  After I made my second bid for this exposition I went to Mr. Shaw and made a proposition to Mr. Shaw to come in with me in partnership with me, Mr. Shaw being an engineer and a competent man (that is, I believed he was a good competent fellow), I thought I could use him and we could work harmoniously together.  I needed an engineer and would have one right there with me.  Mr. Shaw accepted my proposition and we went together.</p>
                            <p>Bidwell&#8212;When your first bid was made, then, Mr. Shaw had nothing to do with it?</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">GREEN ON THE SCENE.</head>
                            <p>Connolly&#8212;No, Mr. Shaw did not.  No, sir; all I knew Mr. Shaw was doing, I was in to see the architect, and I saw him working on the plans, and it was according to those plans that we completed our bid the second time.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;In this testimony about the pile driving it transpired that a man by the name of Green, who is said to be the partner of Templeton, who is an employe in our office.  Green was employed by the exposition some time previous, was he not?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Green was employed for some time by the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;What was he doing?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Driving piles.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Is he an expert, or was he?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;He said he understood driving.  I don't know.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Where did he come from?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I don't know.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Didn't you know that he came from Chicago?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I did not know.  They tell me he came from Chicago.  That he came from Ohio originally, that he lived here some time ago, but had been away for some years.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Wasn't he imported here from Chicago on purpose?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Mr. Rosewater, in this charge here, says that all the iron work, worth $200, was omitted from the Creedon &amp; Mahoney contract.  Is that correct?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;The iron work I referred to was the bolts shown in the original drawing.  I explained last night that changing the backstays from timber to cables.  The iron work aside from that was the lag screws shown here in the drawing and holding this walling on the piles.  That was the construction given by Mr. Shaw, which I changed, because here in the drawing and holding this waling edgeways and back of the piling, and mortising it into the piles, that dispensed with the lag screws.  But the cost to the contractor of making that change, which is mentioned here in the contract, in which he agrees to do that extra, which involves an expense in labor of $200 extra on the contract.  It relieves him of the use of those lag screws, substituting spikes instead.  The difference between the spikes used, and the lag screws, had they been used, would be very infinitesimal, if anything at all.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;The next charge is that of the employment of Mr. Tamm, and that, I think, was explained last evening.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;In looking over my written reply you will find it.  And I will say, also, at the time Mr. Tamm was employed the superstructures were under war, the Administration building was pretty well along under construction.  I had been looking after it myself till near that time, but the necessity for a superintendent of construction arose.  I did not want to employ a man entirely for that work, because there was not enough of it at that time to warrant it.  I therefore asked the architect if there was not somebody in his office he could detail to me to look after that work until it increased in magnitude sufficiently to warrant the employment of a superintendent of construction.  The architect sent me a young man whom I put on the work.  He took care of it for about a week, I should judge, and then disappeared&#8212;left us without notice.  At this time there was some questions disputed about the construction of the drawings and specifications, some work done under the supervision of this superintendent during my absence from the work that was improper; some question of dispute arising with Strehlow on the Manufactures building, and the necessity for a constructionist on that work was imperative.  I learned at this time that William H. Tamm had finished his work with Arthur Johnson &amp; Bro., and sent for him.  I asked him for what wages he would undertake to superintend the work out there.  He replied that he would expect about $7 a day for the work&#8212;would like to have that.  I asked him what he had been receiving.  He said the work he had been doing for Arthur Johnson &amp; Bro. recently being very light, paid $5 a day.  He finally agreed to accept $4 per day.  I told him I would recommend that he be employed at that.  I conferred with Mr. Wattles, told him the situation, told him I needed a man there immediately, and a competent one, or I would have to leave the office and the important affairs of the department and stay out there the greater part of the time on that work.  I told him about Mr. Tamm.  I wanted in this capacity a man in whom I could absolutely depend.  It is a part of the work that I am particularly responsible for, and it is a very important feature of exposition work.  That is, that the construction of the job is done in strict accordance with the plans and specifications and that the man who superintends the job should be there at all hours as the work progresses, to confer with the contractors, to explain anything they do not understand about the drawings, correct any errors that may occur, and prevent any improper work being done before it is done.  I knew Mr. Tamm to be that kind of a man.  It has been stated in the papers here that he was a former employe of mine in the Chicago drainage canal.  My knowledge of Mr. Tamm is confined to these facts.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EMPLOYMENT OF TAMM.</head>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Mr. Chairman, I want to cut this thing short.  None of us have an abundance of time.  It is a very interesting story, but we have not questioned his ability.  We simply question the right of Mr. Geraldine to employ this man.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Mr. Chairman, I feel grieved at this interruption.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;You are only doing it to take up time.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I would like to ask the chairman whether I am reporting to this committee or to Mr. Rosewater?</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I don't think there is anything in Mr. Rosewater's charge here that Mr. Tamm was a former employe of your's, is there?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I referred to that as having been in the newspapers.  I am explaining this to show the very good reasons for employing Mr. Tamm.  At the time I explained this to Mr. Wattles I said I wanted this man immediately.  He said go ahead, that would be all right and he would bring it before the executive committee immediately, at the next meeting.  Now, it is stated in the charges here that it did not come before the executive committee until the 27th of August.  I don't recollect the dates exactly, but I think that this occurred about the 13th or thereabouts.  At all events, I put Mr. Tamm at work the next morning.  After the next meeting of the executive committee Mr. Wattles came to my office and said that the committee would like to know more of Mr. Tamm; also would like to know why I could not use Mr. Daley.  I explained to Mr. Wattles that Mr. Daley could not be used on this work because he did not understand it, and explained what it required.  I said I would get the information he wanted regarding Mr. Tamm.  I telephoned to Mr. Tamm; he came in from work I think that same evening, called at my office, and I took down a statement of his experience.  I handed that over to Mr. Wattles at the next opportunity.  He returned it to me when he came back from the meeting and said that the matter was laid over.  In examining the memorandum I find it is dated August 21, so the matter certainly was brought up before the executive committee at the next meeting after he was employed.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Don't you know that the executive committee has meetings nearly every other day, or every third day?</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Mr. Rosewater charges that the executive committee declined to grant the request for the employment of Mr. Tamm by refusing to take action on the request, and that Mr. Tamm was still found in the employment of the company after that time.  Now, the committee having declined to take action, why did Mr. Tamm continue?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I received no notice from the committee or from Mr. <choice><sic>Watttles</sic><corr>Wattles</corr></choice>, or any intimation that he should be discharged.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Did you notify the committee that he was employed at the time you asked for this permission for appointment?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I did not give any notice direct to it.  I am not expected to or required to.  I gave my notice to the manager of the department, Mr. Wattles?</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;You had notice that the committee declined to accept your recommendation or rather to appoint the man on your recommendation at the time&#8212;declined to take any action?  Did you have notice of that?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;No, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Did the executive committee have knowledge that Mr. Tamm was still in the employ of the association after this time?</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;The only knowledge we had was that his name appeared when we received notice in September of the pay roll for August.  I noticed that Mr. Tamm was on the pay roll for August for fifteen days at $4 a day, and inasmuch as Mr. Wattles had represented that we could engage him
                            
                            <pb n="79" xml:id="TMISB03-079"/>
                            
                            for $100 per month I called the attention of the members to this irregularity, that it was paying him more than he actually wanted.  It is customary for department heads and for their subordinates when they want any assistance of such importance to submit these questions to the executive committee.  What I contend is that if Mr. Geraldine wanted a superintendent of construction he should have sent a communication in some time before for him.  Where did Mr. Tamm come from?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;From Omaha.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;You have not answered my question.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;The committee had no other knowledge until the end of the month.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Did they have any official notice that this man was still in the employ of the association?</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;No other notice except this fact, that his name had appeared on the August pay roll and at the end of September we were asked on the return of Mr. Kirkendall&#8212;on his return the secretary refused to certify to this pay roll because Mr. Tamm employment had not been authorized.  He refused to make out a voucher and thereupon notified Mr. Kirkendall that some action must be taken to legalize this matter before the voucher would issue.  Then was the first time we had any official notice that Mr. Tamm was still in the employ and inasmuch as he had done the work we voted to pay him.  And there it ends, but he has no authority yet at the present time.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I want to know or Mr. Geraldine why he designated this man as superintendent of construction.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Because that is his business.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;What are you, then?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;I was employed as general superintendent of the Grounds and Buildings Department.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">NO SUCH RECORD.</head>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;There is no such record anywhere.  The minutes of our association show that the title was the superintendent for the Department of Buildings and Grounds; not general superintendent.  And that is one reason why at the time Mr. Tamm's name was proposed I objected.  I did not see why we should have two superintendents.  Are we going to promote them to generals, lieutenant generals and major generals and all that?</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;The committee have acquiesced to the continuance of Mr. Tamm's employment and having paid him on a voucher and the matter being under discussion, should not the committee have taken some action in this matter, either declining to continue Mr. Tamm or acquiescing in it.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;We had a very long session, this all occurred last Friday, and it would not have been, perhaps, prudent, I did not so regard it, that his services be dispensed with, not knowing just to what extent he is employed or his services are necessary, and in view of the fact that these charges were then and there preferred and that statement made, it did not clear Mr. Geraldine in any way what we should do subsequently.  It showed that he was carrying on this department on his own part in an arbitrary, unmethodical and unlawful way, if it can be unlawful.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;The next question raised here is the employment, or rather the awarding of a contract to Mr. Daley for the construction of a sewer, without plans and without specifications, and without bond being given.  What was there about that?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Do you wish <choice><sic>we</sic><corr>me</corr></choice> to explain all that leads up to the letting of this contract, or just the bare facts?</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;I think the bare facts are all we care for.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;We advertised for bids for a sewer to be constructed on the intersection of the sewer on the Kountze tract, at Twentieth street north to the line of Bayard street and east to Sherman avenue.  We prepared plans for that sewer.  A plan in the appearance of the work looking down from the top, showing where it is to be laid, in what street, in what part of the street and where the laterals were to be put in.  We prepared a profile showing the surface of the grounds, the depth at which that sewer should be placed at all points, the size of the sewer, and on this map we placed the specifications, which give the size and quality of the sewer pipe, and referred as it was laid in the public streets and that the city specifications would apply.  Bids were received, contractors came to the office and examined the plans and specifications and put in bids.  Mr. Daley had been a former employe as foreman of the sewer gang that constructed the sewer that the exposition built itself.  He had been discharged some time before when the work was completed.  When the bids were opened I found the bid of Mr. Daley and it was the lowest bid&#8212;something less than $2 lower than the next bidder.  After opening the bids, which was done in public, I had a conference with Mr. Wattles in which I stated to Mr. Wattles that I did not wish to give that contract to Mr. Daley because I wished to employ him to superintend the sheet piling around the lagoon which we were about to begin, because I had found in his former service he was a good man.  Mr. Daley had come to me as a perfect stranger, recommended by one of the prominent citizens, and I employed him, first as foreman of the fence gang, at $2.50 a day; later in charge of the sewer work, which is his regular business, I understand.  I found him to be, as far as I could discern, a faithful and competent man.  He took particular pains to follow his work carefully in the sewer built, and I examined it daily myself.  I found that he was a shipwright by trade, and from what I could learn he had a better knowledge of this mixed class of work that was required on the lagoon sheet piling than any man I could find, a fellow I could rely upon, and I wished to employ him in that work.  There was not very much in the contract anyhow and I thought he would be willing to give it up if I would give him employment.  I told him I would like to employ him to superintend the sheet piling, and if he took this contract I could not do it.  He said that he could make some money on the contract and did not like to give it up, but if I would promise him permanent employment he would go and arrange with the next bidder to take it and pay the difference.  I told him I could not promise him permanent employment.  He then stated if we would give him the contract it would only take him ten days or two weeks to carry it out, and during that time he would superintend the work on the lagoon for nothing as a donation to the exposition, and when he had finished his contract and had nothing else to do he would accept pay.  I told him he could not do that; if he had a contract for the exposition, while carrying out that contract, do anything as a representative of the exposition.  Some of this discussion took place in Mr. Wattles' presence and Mr. Wattles took the matter to the committee and returned to the office and told me that there was not a full board of the executive committee, but the matter had been discussed by those present and decided to give the contract to Daley and I could go ahead with the necessary arrangements.  The next day, after the regular meeting of the executive committee, Mr. Wattles informed me that they had awarded the contract to Mr. Sharp, because it was stated that Daley was an employe of the exposition.  Meantime I had notified Daley that he might go ahead with his work and I would send him written authority later.  I explained this to Mr. Wattles and at once sent out to find Daley and tell him not to go any further.  The next day the committee met again, I received notice from Mr. Wattles after the meeting that they had reconsidered the matter and awarded the contract to Mr. Daley.  I wrote Mr. Daley an order to go ahead with the work.  It was a small job, required but a short time to do it, and to go through the formality of writing and executing a regular contract seemed to me utterly unnecessary.  I stated to him in this letter to go ahead with the work according to the plans and specifications to that effect, don't know just what the wording was, that his work would be subject to test in such cases.  And being on the grounds much of the time the work was in progress I deemed it unnecessary to employ an inspector, but inspected the work myself.  He did a first class job.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">NO CONTRACT WITH DALEY.</head>
                            <p>The statement, as you will find in my written answer there, that the statement that the contract was let without plans and specifications is not true.  Now, the reason that there was no bond or contract required is, first, the smallness of the job; next, that Mr. Daley asked for no obligation on the part of the exposition until the work was completed and accepted.  It is customary in work of this kind, in small contracts or orders like that, to be treated just the same as an order or a purchase, without the red tape of a contract signed by the officers of the exposition just the same as you would order a bill of goods or employ a man to do a piece of work.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Did I understand, Mr. Geraldine, that this contract was let to Mr. Daley under instructions from the committee?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;And that what was omitted in Mr. Daley's case was the executing of a formal contract?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;But that the work was done according to the specifications and after the completion the work was accepted in a formal way and paid for?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir, it was accepted in a formal way and paid for formally.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;It might be inferred from this that Mr. Daley was employed by the association at a higher price per day than was customary to be paid for that class of work by the city.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;That is incorrect.  When Mr. Daley was employed on the sewer, in the construction of the sewer, he was paid $5 <choice><sic>pr</sic><corr>per</corr></choice> day; $3 of that was for personal services and $2 for the use of the tools used by all the men in handling the pipe, and a horse and wagon.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Then the fact would be that, notwithstanding that Mr. Daley appeared on the pay roll for $5 a day, that he was receiving for his personal services $3?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Was that known to the committee?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir.  It was known to the committee.  It appeared on the pay roll, Mr. Daley, tools, etc., $5 per day.  I explained that to you myself, Mr. Rosewater.  You have forgotten it.</p>
                            <p>Reed&#8212;It was explained to me.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Mr. Rosewater charges finally that Daley was employed at $4 per day after this sewer work was done, as inspector, and he charges that (by implication, perhaps, not directly) that instead of action as inspector he was employing his time in raking up shaving from the bottom of the lagoon.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;Employing his time for the benefit of the contractor.  That is about the substance of it.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;What is there of that, Mr. Geraldine?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;That is untrue.  Some one has been misleading you, Mr. Rosewater.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater&#8212;I had it from two or three people who saw it.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;This is a matter on which I am fully posted.  I am competent to reply.</p>
                            <p>Kountze&#8212;Did Mr. Daley during this time he was employed as superintendent on the lagoon perform that work in a manner satisfactory?</p>
                            <p>Geraldine&#8212;Yes, sir; very satisfactory.  In regard to picking up of shavings, as the charge was made, when I put Mr. Daley on this work they were working three or four gangs.  They were giving me a good deal of trouble to get the work done right.  The head of the firm, Mr. Creedon, whom I found to be a good mechanic and well posted man in that line of work, was absent.  He explained to me that he could not be on that work because he had other work and strikes on his hands.  The foremen that he sent out there to do the work were incompetent, troublesome and evasive, and gave me a good deal of trouble.  For this reason I was very glad to get the services of Mr. Daley for the few days that remained, because I could depend upon him to see that the work was done all right.  I was on the work out there every day.  I remember the contention.  Mr. Daley was disputing as I drove along the side of the canal, was disputing with Mr. Creedon, ordering him to clean up the shavings and stuff out of the bottom of the lagoon at the east end, and complained to me that the contractor did not carry out orders; that he had just had trouble with one of his foremen, whom he claimed had not done his work right, and the foreman had called him a liar.  He demanded the dismissal of that man, which the contractor refused to comply with.  I looked into the matter.  Mr. Creedon came up to the buggy and said if there was anything of the kind that was wrong he wished to make it right, and if this man had been insolent to the inspector he would discharge him.  But this matter in the bottom of the lagoon Mr. Daley referred to was the pile heads cut off by our own men, for which he was not responsible.  It was a very small matter and Mr. Daley said if that was the case he would throw them out himself, which he did.</p>
                            <p>Rosewater:  I don't regard that as the main part of it.  I simply show that the men out there are doing a good deal more play than work.</p>

                            <dateline>THE WORLD-HERALD: OMAHA, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1897.</dateline>
                            <head type="sub">PLAIN WORDS ABOUT THE EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <p>The interests of the exposition are too important to warrant any newspaper controversy, and the World-Herald has no disposition to engage in any dispute on the questions that have recently been agitated.  But it is the duty of the World-Herald at this time to register its solemn promise against the persistent agitation that is being waged by the Omaha Bee&#8212;an agitation that must have its inspiration in the failure of the editor of that newspaper to rule, and his determination to ruin where his personality and will cannot dominate.</p>
                            <p>The management of the exposition is vested in an executive board composed of six men, one of them being the editor of the Bee.  Back of this board is a directory of fifty members, to whom appeal may be made by any one who may feel aggrieved concerning the management of the executive board.  If the high character of the men comprising the executive  board is not sufficient assurance that the affairs of the exposition will be cared for as faithfully and with as few mistakes as it is possible for honest and thoughtful men to make, then the doubting ones may have confidence that the fifty good citizens who comprise the directory will correct any serious errors that may be made.  They ought to know, and they do know, that anything that has the appearance of deliberate wrong or is not in accord with exact honesty could not obtain indorsement at the hands of so large a body of good men comprising the exposition directory.</p>
                            <p>The gentlemen comprising the executive board have devoted their best energies to the exposition's preparatory work.  Not every one appreciates the discouragements that have confronted these men.  They undertook this great project during a period of general distress and laid the foundation under great disadvantages.  When others doubted the success of the project these men were confident, and proved their faith by their works.  If they had made no mistakes they themselves would have been surprised.  But when we criticise them we must remember that the responsibility rests with them and authority must accompany responsibility.</p>
                            <p>These gentlemen are charged with the responsibility of preparing for the great exposition upon which Omaha and the west places so much dependence at this time.  That exposition is an assured fact.  That fact is largely due to the patient and persistent effort of these men.  Every good citizen of Omaha is anxious for the success of this exposition.  The least that the good citizen can contribute to this success is a patriotic co-operation in the work of these men.  The least that can be bestowed is a decent appreciation of this faithful work.  While these men are giving their time and effort to the good of Omaha they have a right to be exempt from indecent assaults upon their good names.  They have a right to be protected from unwarranted slurs upon their good efforts.  In some instances we might adopt a different course from that pursued by this executive board, but it is a great deal easier to criticise another man's effort than it would be to actually improve upon that effort if our places were exchanged.</p>
                            <p>In this view it is the duty of Omaha's good citizens to show their appreciation of the good effort being exerted in behalf of their city.</p>
                            <p>Coming directly to the indecent attacks now being made by the Omaha Bee, the World-Herald desires to make a few pointed remarks.  And be it understood that the responsibility for the necessity of this plain Anglo-Saxon is not with this newspaper.  The editor of the Bee preferred charges against an employe of the exposition.  If he had been as loyal to Omaha and the exposition as he was devoted to his miserable habit of traducing those whom he cannot rule he would have made him charges in executive session of the large directory for the purpose of hearing his appeal.  But that did not suit his purpose.  In his favorite role of the politician he had become thoroughly discredited with his own party, while his influence with the public had been shattered because the public eye had at last penetrated the mask of hypocrisy so long and so successfully worn.  Some new evidence of power must be given.  The charges were made with a great blare of trumpets.  Three gentlemen of unimpeachable character&#8212;Herman Kountze, Lucius Wells and George F. Bidwell&#8212;were called upon to hear those charges.  The result of their decision was a defeat for the accuser.  An appeal was taken to the large directory, and, even though the accuser threatened to resign from the executive board and hinted at an opposition to the voting of the exposition boards&#8212;in the face of these threats the accuser met with another defeat.  As a result he flies to his mud batteries and opens them upon men whose chief fault seems to be that they have, in one instance, refused to sneeze when Mr. Rosewater took snuff.  The World-Herald does not offer a defense for any exposition employe.  We are satisfied that Messrs. Kountze, Bidwell and Wells would not "whitewash" any man, and the fact that they could not find any evidence of dishonesty is sufficient proof for fair men that such proof was not offered.  These matters should be left with the exposition boards and the interests of that great project will be best subserved when such discussions are confined to those boards.  If any employe has faults he will certainly be required to remedy those faults by the men who are assuredly greatly concerned in making the exposition a success.</p>
                            <p>When it is discovered that the men who comprise these boards have deceived the people of Omaha all these years and have built up good reputations without having good characters, then will be the proper time to question their watchfulness and then will be the proper time to make their management the target for newspaper criticism.  That time has not come when the editor of the Bee "casts the first stone."  In one of his malignant attacks he says: "The only way to make the exposition a success is to keep the searchlight of publicity constantly turned upon its management."  Why did this thought suddenly occur at the very moment that he had met with a humiliating defeat?  Why does he now throw out his gratuitous insult to boards comprising fifty good citizens of Omaha&#8212;men who without pay are exerting their best efforts for Omaha's welfare?</p>
                            <p>The explanation is that Mr. Rosewater is determined to rule or ruin.  That has been his policy in politics, and yet we confess to some amazement that he should carry that policy to so important a business affair as the exposition project.  He unsparingly hurls cruel shafts at some of Omaha's best citizens and yet we remember that he has a very ready protest whenever an arrow is aimed by a skillful marksman at his own heart.  He broadly hints that his malignant assaults upon the exposition management spring from his abhorrence to anything that smacks of dishonesty and yet we remember that six months ago he permitted his newspaper to support for a public office a man who was openly charged with the embezzlement of public money.  He poses as a hater of everything that suggests corruption and yet we observe that his newspaper is the patient and persistent defender of a man whose sole defense to the charge of embezzling several thousand dollars of public money is that the law requiring the payment of that money is unconstitutional.  In the light of what he has permitted his newspaper to do in relation to a self-confessed defaulter the public cannot seriously consider what he permits the newspaper to do in respect to Omaha men of character and public spirit.</p>
                            <p>The persistency of these attacks calls for prompt attention.  Mr. Rosewater has resigned.  His resignation should be promptly accepted.  His usefulness as a member of the executive board is at an end.  If he is an enemy of the exposition because he could not rule in all things let him take his stand outside the breastworks behind which loyal Omahans are fighting the battle for their town.</p>
                            <p>A town that is not big enough to withstand the bluff and bluster of one man who bluffs and blusters because he cannot bring every other man to his own way of thinking is not a big enough town to successfully carry out a Trans-Mississippi exposition.</p>
                            <p>Let Mr. Rosewater go&#8212;and help him with his going.  Let it be established right now as an Omaha rule that he who is not with Omaha is against Omaha.  Let it be written upon the outer walls of this city, where he who runs may read, that the opinion of every good citizen is entitled to all due weight, but that one-man rule is a thing of the past.</p>
                            <p>It is the duty of every good citizen to aid in stamping out anything that tends to check the progress of the great exposition that will be held in Omaha in 1898.  A pronounced move in this direction will have been made when it shall be established to the satisfaction of all intelligent men that Omaha will not submit to a dictator and that Omaha will not tolerate a traitor.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Dion Geraldine's connection with the Transmississippi Exposition commenced March 1, 1897.  Twelve days afterward, or March 12, he assigned to Joseph Hayden of this city all the salary which will be coming to him up to and including July 14, 1898, if his connection with the exposition should continue until that time.  There are two of these assignments, the first being for $1,730 and the second for $5,000.  It is openly charged by numerous attorneys in this city who have undertaken to collect a multiplicity of judgments against Geraldine, rendered in Chicago and sent to Omaha for collection, that these assignments are fraudulent and without consideration and were for the sole purpose of evading the payment of the judgments in question.  The truthfulness of this charge will soon be a matter of record in the courts of this city, as Joseph Hayden has been ordered to appear in one of these cases and show what consideration passed between himself and Geraldine to offset these assignments of salary without reservation for a period extending over nearly fifteen months.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="81" xml:id="TMISB03-081"/>
                            
                            <p>These facts were brought to light in a case which was heard in Justice Foster's court yesterday.  The case was entitled the Western Bank Note Engraving company against Dion Geraldine and was a case to collect a judgment secured in a Chicago court against Geraldine for $99.65, with interest and costs.  The case was commenced several weeks ago and an order in garnishment was issued against the Transmississippi and International Exposition, attaching Geraldine's salary.  In accordance with the notice of this action Secretary Wakefield appeared in Justice Foster's court yesterday to make a showing why the claim of the plaintiff should not be paid by the exposition out of Geraldine's salary of $500 per month.</p>
                            <p>The plaintiff in the case was represented by W. A. DeBord of the firm of Bartlett, Baldrige &amp; DeBord and he put Secretary Wakefield on the stand to show cause why the claim should not be paid.  In answer to questions along this line the secretary of the exposition said he had in his possession two assignments of Geraldine's salary amounting to $6,730 which were paid off at the rate of $500 per month and nothing remained with which to pay off any other claim.</p>

                            <p>He was asked to produce these documents and he then drew from his pocket two papers and handed them to the court.  Both were single sheets of ordinary letter paper and both were in the handwriting of Dion Geraldine, and were signed by him.  Both bore date of March 12, 1897, and Secretary Wakefield testified that they had been filed with him by Mr. Hayden some time prior to April 30, this year.  The assignment for $5,000 was as follows:</p>
                            <p>"I, Dion Geraldine, of the city of Omaha, county of Douglas, state of Nebraska, in consideration of the sum of $5,000 to me in hand paid, receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, have sold, assigned, transferred and set over unto Joseph Hayden of the said city of Omaha my salary as the same may become due and owing to me as superintendent of the Transmississippi and International Exposition to the amount of said sum of $5,000, and I hereby authorize the proper officer of said Transmississippi and International Exposition to pay to the said Joseph Hayden the sum of $5,000 out of my said salary and pay to him as the same shall become due and payable, and these presents shall be their authority for such payments.</p>
                            <signed>(Signed.)
                            <lb/>
                            "DION GERALDINE."</signed>

                            <div3>
                            <p>On the back of this document was the following endorsement:</p>
                            <p>"Transmississippi and International Exposition: Please pay to Joseph Hayden the sum of $5,000 out of my salary as the same shall become due and payable, in accordance with the above assignment of the same.  This is subject to assignment order made this day covering the sum of $1,730.50.</p>
                            <signed>(Signed.)
                            <lb/>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The assignment of $1,730.50 was the same in every respect as the one given in full, with the exception that it was stated that it was not to apply until April 1, 1897, and the order to the exposition to pay the money to Joseph Hayden was written on a separate sheet of paper.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield testified that he had paid Geraldine his full salary for March, but had paid all his monthly salary to Mr. Hayden since that time, paying Geraldine nothing at all.  He said he had made the payments of $500 to Mr. Hayden on these dates: April 30, June 1, July 2, August 2, September 1 and October 1, making $3,000 in all.</p>
                            <p>In reply to further questions, Mr. Wakefield said he knew nothing whatever about the transaction except what appeared in the papers he had produced.  He said he had no knowledge regarding the consideration which caused the giving of the assignments.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">THERE ARE OTHER CASES.</head>
                            <p>Mr. DeBord then asked the court to issue an order on Joseph Hayden to appear and show to the court the consideration for which these assignments had been given and to show cause why the exposition should not be ordered to pay the claim of the Western Bank Note and Engraving company.  Secretary Wakefield was ordered to hold $125 out of Geraldine's salary pending the settlement of this phase of the case.  The case was set for further hearing October 25, when Mr. Hayden will be cited to appear and make his showing.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine is also mixed up in another case which is pending in the courts of this city.  This is the case of the Toby Furniture company of Chicago against Dion Geraldine, being a suit to recover $85.25 for furniture bought by Geraldine of the plaintiff in February, 1895, and not yet paid for.  This case is in the municipal court of this city and there is a very grave suspicion that Mr. Geraldine has added a more serious offense to his many other accomplishments in the line of distorting facts.</p>
                            <p>This suit is based on the purchase by Geraldine of a small quantity of cheap furniture, the itemized bill attached to the files in the case being as follows:</p>

                            <p>Attached to the other documents in the case are the affidavits of the man who sold the goods, the shipping clerk who shipped them to him and who afterward presented the bill, and also that of the credit man of the firm, setting forth the facts in the case in the most positive manner and also stating that no objection had ever been made by Geraldine to the goods or their time of shipment.</p>
                            <p>This case was commenced in the municipal court in June and was continued for ten days after the time first set, on the request of Geraldine.  July 31 an affidavit for a continuance of sixty days was filed.  This affidavit was sworn to be Geraldine and the statements therein contained are the ones which arouse the suspicion that the truth was not adhered to.  This request for a continuance was based on the statement that the testimony of W. H. Tamm was very material to the defendant and that he would be unable to proceed without having Tamm's evidence.  The affidavit was dated July 22, and stated that at that time W. H. Tamm was in Europe on a pleasure trip, having left Boston, Mass., July 1, and would travel about Europe until about September 1.  It was stated that the affiant had made diligent efforts to learn Tamm's whereabouts by inquiring of people who were supposed to know where he was going, but had been unable to locate him.  It was further stated as follows:</p>

                            <head type="sub">TAMM'S RAPID TRANSIT.</head>
                            <p>"Affiant further says that the said W. H. Tamm has business in Omaha which must be attended to by October 1 and affiant knows of his own personal knowledge that said W. H. Tamm expects to be in Omaha by October 1, 1897."</p> 
                            <p>As a matter of fact, W. H. Tamm was in Omaha working on the exposition within two weeks after this affidavit was filed, appearing on the pay roll for fourteen days in August at $4 per day.  This is rapid transit with a vengeance.  If Tamm was traveling in Europe July 31 he must have returned by flying machine to drop into a soft job in Omaha within less than two weeks.</p>
                            <p>In the absence of evidence to controvert the statements in the affidavit referred to the case was continued as requested and came to trial before Judge Burnham October 9.  Judge Burnham is authority for the statement that Geraldine himself did not appear and no witnesses were sworn in or examined in the case.  Even Tamm did not come down from the exposition grounds and give the important testimony which was to save a judgment being rendered against his former employer.  A judgment was rendered in full against Geraldine, being for $95 and the costs of the case, amounting to $13.78, a total of $108.78.</p>
                            <p>In this case the exposition management was <choice><sic>garnisheed</sic><corr>garnished</corr></choice> and summoned to appear and show cause why Geraldine's salary should not be partially devoted to paying this judgment.  The day for the answer to be made is October 25, and it is a foregone conclusion that the two assignments to Joseph Hayden will be flashed on the court, as was done in the case in Justice Foster's court.</p>
                            <p>These are not the only cases in which Geraldine's bad debts have been sent to Omaha for collection.  The district court records contain a case in which Marsh &amp; Brigham of Chicago file a judgment for $1,332.01, which was obtained in the Chicago courts, but which remains unsatisfied and was sent to Omaha for collection.  This case is on the docket of this term for trial.</p>
                            <p>There are several firms of attorneys in this city which have claims that have been sent to them for collection, but they have advised their clients that it is useless to attempt to force the collection of any bills against Geraldine, as he is "execution proof."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Abandons His Desire to Control the Music of the Exposition.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The name of A. Rommel of Mount Pleasant, Ia., who was nominated Wednesday by Manager Lindsey of the executive committee of the exposition for the position of musical director, was withdrawn at the regular meeting yesterday and the name of Thomas J. Pennell, a well known Omaha musician, was substituted.  This action was embodied in the following written report to the executive committee:</p>
                            <p>To the Executive Committee of the Transmississippi and International Exposition: Gentlemen&#8212;Complying with the written request of A. Rommel I hereby withdraw his name as an applicant for the position of musical director of the Transmississippi and International Exposition.  In the place of Mr. Rommel I recommend a man who is well known in Omaha, who is an owner of considerable property in the city and who has lived here for many years.  He has filled an important position with credit and is highly recommended by his late employers as being a man of good business ability and unquestioned honesty.  He has undoubtedly done as much to advance the cause of music in Omaha as any other person.  He is an untiring worker and is considered by good musicians as capable of planning, managing and conducting the music of the exposition.  I allude to Thomas J. Pennell.  Mr. Pennell is a musician of recognized ability, who is now abroad studying European methods of directing orchestral and other large performances.  It is scarcely necessary to state that he has been connected with the leading musical organizations of Omaha for years.</p>
                            <p>I recommend the employment of Mr. Pennell as musical director of the Transmississippi and International Exposition, at a salary of $100 per month from the time that he begins his work for the exposition until November, 1898.  When out of the city on business connected with the musical department, transportation is to be furnished Mr. Pennell and necessary traveling expenses paid.  Mr. Pennell states that if elected he will come home at once.  Upon his arrival his plan will be submitted to the executive committee for approval.  If elected musical director Mr. Pennell shall have full charge of the music of the exposition, subject only to the Department of Ways and Means under the rules and regulations of the executive committee.  Respectfully submitted,</p>
                            <signed>Z. T. LINDSEY.</signed>

                            <p>When this report was made Mr. Reed moved that the committee go into executive session for the consideration of the subject.  This was carried.  After about twenty minutes the doors were opened and it was announced that action on the appointment of Mr. Pennell had been deferred for one week.</p>
                            <p>A birdseye drawing showing the main and north tract of the exposition grounds was submitted for the approval of the committee by A. J. Dockerty.  After a critical examination the committee decided to not accept the drawing.</p>

                            <p>Manager Kirkendall reported that he had employed John C. Carney as the inspector to supervise the laying of the water pipe on the exposition ground, and he asked that his action be indorsed.  This was done, Carney's appointment to date from October 13.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kirkendall also submitted a report on a number of bids which had been received for supplying decorative plants for the exposition grounds to be propagated during the winter and delivered on the grounds next year as required.  Mr. Kirkendall stated that the cost of the 100,000 plants covered by these bids would be, approximately, $1,581.75, but he said it would be impossible to state the exact figures until the stock had been examined and passed upon, as it would be necessary to make selections to the best advantage and the price might not be the lowest in every case.  The lowest bidders on the several varieties of plants were these: L. A. Moore of Plattsmouth, lowest on geranium, coleus, alternanthera in flats and pots, heliotrope and salvia splendens; P. H. Bush of Lincoln, on aehyranthes, centaurea and Madam Sallouriger; Paul B. Floth of Omaha, on pyrethrum, lobella, ageratum, alyssum and verbena; Henry Peterson of Omaha, on graphalium; Chapin Brothers of Lincoln, petunia; J. F. Wilcox of Omaha, vinca rosea and alba rosea.</p>
                            <p>In this connection Mr. Kirkendall asked and was given authority to employ a man to inspect these plants offered and select the stock best suited to the purposes of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>At Mr. Kirkendall's request the maximum cost of the projected service building was discussed by the committee and the outside figure was fixed at $4,000.</p>
                            <p>The location of the Girls' and Boys' building was brought up by Mr. Kirkendall, who wished to have an expression of the committee regarding the location which should be assigned to this building.  The matter was discussed briefly, but no action was taken.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles reported that he had received notice from Chairman Harper of the executive committee of the Illinois Exposition commission to the effect that the Illinois commission would leave Chicago for Omaha Tuesday of next week, and would arrive in Omaha the next morning.  Mr. Harper stated that a strong effort would be made to have all the members of the Illinois commission in the party, and that there would probably be fifteen or eighteen men, all told.  The commission comes for the purpose of talking over exposition matters in general, as related to the connection of Illinois with the Transmississippi Exposition, and to select a site for the Illinois building, which will be erected at a cost of about $20,000.</p>
                            <p>The question of securing the old Coliseum building on North Twentieth street for the meetings which will be held in connection with the exposition, which has been under consideration several times, was brought up a communication from Secretary Metz of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben, who asked that a proposition be made for the use of the structure.  It was finally decided that no proposition would be made, which involved the leasing of the building, but it was suggested that it be made into an auditorium suitable for large conventions, etc., and that the exposition would undoubtedly use it for certain occasions.</p>
                            <p>Just before the meeting adjourned, Manager Rosewater called attention to the fact that the Board of Directors had made no provision for filling the vacancy in the committee which would be caused by his resignation as manager of the Department of Publicity and Promotion.  He said he did not wish to leave the work without turning it over to whoever may be chosen as his successor, and he suggested that a special meeting of the Board of Directors be called at once to take action on this matter, as that body was the only one having authority to fill such vacancies.</p>

                            <p>OMAHA, Oct. 15.&#8212;To the Editor of the Bee: I have noticed in your paper several charges made against Mr. Geraldine, criticizing his method of letting contracts, and other trifling charges brought forth against this eminent man from Chicago.

                            <p>Perhaps you are not aware that the world is indebted to the brilliant genius of this wonderfully great man from Chicago for the landscape beauty and magnificent architectural display of those great buildings.  All the beauty and grandeur of conception originated in the mind of this wonderful man from Chicago.  This great genius has condescended to come to this insignificant city and has offered his services in order to secure the success of the exposition.  All that is necessary is to give this great man from Chicago full power to transact all the business connected with the transmississippi show and success is guaranteed.</p>
                            <p>There is no need of board managers.  All that is necessary is to furnish the money to pay the bills, judging by the contracts already granted.  You can <choice><sic>relie</sic><corr>rely</corr></choice> on his economy.  Witness his paying $4 per day to his friend for picking up chips.  Suppose he does give employment to his relatives, uncles and aunts and wife's relations, they are all from Chicago and that is enough to insure their competency for picking up chips or anything else laying around loose.</p>
                            <p>Now I hope you won't interfere or criticise the acts of this Chicago genius.  I hope you won't be offended with me for differing with you in my views in regard to the conduct of this Chicago a rara avis.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Official Action Taken by the Central Labor Union.</head>
                            <p>At the meeting of the Central Labor union last night official action was taken to oppose the voting of $100,000 of county bonds for the Transmississippi Exposition.  A communication was read from the Building Trades Council, stating that no understanding with the exposition management could be reached.  It complained that tradesmen could not obtain work on the grounds at living wages, and asked that a levy should be made upon each union to defeat the bond proposition.</p>
                            <p>The Central Labor union endorsed the position taken by the council, and instructed each delegate present to inform his union of the situation.  In case the exposition will recognize union labor the Central Labor union will reverse its action and will be willing to help bear the burden of the bond issue.</p>
                            <p>F. Schmohl and Gus Leander submitted their credentials from the Staff Workers' union and were received as delegates.  The card of B. Lindeman was also accepted from the Cigar Makers' union.</p>

                            <p>Two weeks from Tuesday the proposition to issue $100,000 of county bonds in aid of the exposition will be voted on by the citizens of Douglas county.  These bonds are absolutely needed to enable the exposition management to carry out the work already in hand.  Even with these bonds voted, the exposition must raise at least $100,000 additional by stock subscription or donation in order to open the gates promptly on June 1.</p>
                            <p>With all the influence that can be brought to bear upon the voters by persuasive argument the bonds will not receive the necessary two-thirds vote unless confidence is restored in the exposition management.  For months there have been mutterings of dissatisfaction with the superintendent in charge of the buildings and grounds.  At first it was principally resentment of his arrogant and insulting bearing, coupled with his undisguised preference for imported workingmen.  Gradually it dawned upon the community that Geraldine had an object in view in surrounding himself with non-resident confidants who could be depended on to second his efforts for contractors with whom he stood in.</p>
                            <p>The discontent grew from day to day until it reached the stage of open revolt.  Reports of rank discrimination and reckless changes in plans and specifications came thick and fast from all quarters.  Organized labor rose in arms and openly proclaimed its determination to defeat the exposition bonds unless Geraldine was supplanted.  Several thousand of the smaller stockholders who belong to the wage-working and home-owning class announced that they would quit paying assessments unless Geraldine was deposed and business methods introduced that would afford them protection from jobbery and waste.</p>
                            <p>These facts must have been known to President Wattles and the manager in charge of the department in which Geraldine is employed, but they showed no disposition to meet the emergency, seeming rather to prefer to let the bonds be defeated than to dispense with the man who had proved himself a costly fraud.  It was the conviction that action had to be taken to save the exposition from threatened disaster that impelled the editor of The Bee to prefer charges against Geraldine and demand his summary removal both on the ground of economy as well as for cause.</p>
                            <p>The effort to convince the board that Geraldine is a menace to the success of the exposition has up to this time proved abortive.  His backers still insist that he is an honest man, although ninety-nine out of every hundred people in the community distrust him and those who have inquired into his career know him to be a dead-beat, a charlatan, and utterly unreliable.</p>
                            <p>The questions that must be met now are: Shall the opportunity to carry the $100,000 of exposition bonds be thrown away for the sake of keeping the imported $500-a-month jack-of-all-trades on the pay roll?  Shall the whole exposition court constant suspicion and discord in order to make good the $5,000 which Geraldine says he has drawn in advance on his salary?  Can the exposition afford to defy public sentiment, alienate the good will of the workingmen, and invite financial embarrassment by a course that has shaken the confidence of its stock subscribers and must tend to prevent others from contributing assistance?  Every hour's delay renders the situation more critical and makes the result of the bond election more doubtful.</p>

                            <p>A. H. Griffiths, art director for the exposition, reports flattering progress in the work of securing desirable works of art for the exhibit which is to be made in the Art building.  Mr. Griffiths states that the museums of Chicago, St. Louis, Milwaukee, Cleveland and Cincinnati have promised to loan the exposition some of their most valuable and most desirable works of art.  Among these Mr. Griffiths makes special mention of the painting, "The Shepherd's Star," belonging to the Chicago museum.  In addition to the exhibits which will be secured from these sources Mr. Griffiths says that he has the Colin Campbell Cooper collection of paintings now on exhibition at the Nashville exposition and a number of the works of Miss Haydock of Cincinnati.  He also says that Albert Neuhuys of Hilversun, Holland, will send several pictures.</p>
                            <p>The work of selecting competent judges of art to pass upon proffered exhibits in different cities or countries before they are shipped to Omaha is going on apace.  Jules Rollshoven has been appointed as commissioner for England for this purpose, Dr. DeGrott for Holland, Theodore Cooley for Tennessee and Mr. Griffiths has recommended the appointment of R. Hall McCormick of Chicago as commissioner for Illinois.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Griffiths has just visited the Milwaukee art exhibit, and is now in New York.  He will visit Chicago October 20 to attend the art exhibit in that city.</p>

Mr. Mischke also states that Colorado will want at least 12,000 feet in the Agricultural building for its exhibits and will also want considerable space in the Mines building, but he says he is unable to give definite figures regarding the latter building, owing to the illness of the state mining commissioner.

                            <p>Vice President Charles R. Drake of Arizona has notified the Department of Exhibits that he is having a series of conferences with Governor McCord regarding an exhibit of the resources of the territory at the Transmississippi Exposition.  He says an exhibit will certainly be made, but the exact extent of it has not yet been determined.  He asks, however, that space be reserved for the territory until such time as it can be determined just how much of an exhibit can be collected and installed.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">GERALDINE NOT INDISPENSABLE.</hi></head>
                            <p>The only excuse offered for retaining Dion Geraldine at a salary of $500 a month on the pay roll of the exposition is that his services are indispensable.  If this assertion were true it would be most damaging to the exposition to have it so understood by contractors, concessionaires and employes.  If Geraldine is indispensable he can ride rough shod over everybody, levy tribute on contractors and distribute jobs and sinecures right and left.</p>
                            <p>Fortunately Dion Geraldine is not indispensable.  He is a mechanical mountebank who claims to be a born genius and mastered all trades and professions, when in fact he is an expert in none.  During his first residence in Omaha he acted as agent for an agricultural implement house.  Within a few years he blossomed out into a general master mechanic, and yet he has done nothing for the exposition except costly experimenting and tampering with plans made by sewerage engineers, landscape architects, hydraulic engineers and other professional experts specially engaged by the exposition management.  All that he has done could easily have been better performed by any one of a score of Omaha men at less than half the salary.  What remains to be done by the superintendent of grounds and buildings can be done by any man of executive force and mechanical training.</p>
                            <p>Not only can any number of competent men be found in this vicinity to take Geraldine's place, but the exposition will fare better without him than with him.  It is not only generally believed but established beyond reasonable doubt that Geraldine can not be trusted either to tell the truth or to deal honestly with the exposition.  He has pursued a course of systematic deception and doubledealing with his superiors, carried on intrigues with contractors and foisted useless favorites on the pay roll as employes.  He has rendered himself offensive to the great body of workingmen and arrayed against the exposition public sentiment which should and would be in hearty sympathy with it.  In this he is but repeating his World's fair career, which was abruptly terminated to promote the interest of the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GREAT LUCK OF DIRECTOR GRIFFITHS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Secures for the Exposition the Famous Old Painting, the "Fall of Babylon"&#8212;Work of Wisconsin Commission.</head>
                            <p>Art Director Griffiths notified the exposition management this morning that he has now secured possession of the famous painting, "The Fall of Babylon," for which he has been negotiating for the last two months.</p>
                            <p>This painting is by Georges Rochegrosse, a contemporary artist of the French school of Versailles.  He was a pupil of Jules Lefebre and Boulanger.  He took his first medal in 1882, and, in the succeeding year, the Grand Prix Salon.  "The Fall of Babylon," after taking a prize, was purchased by a syndicate in Chicago for exhibition purposes throughout the country.  It was subsequently sold to a New York syndicate.  The picture is a large one, fully forty feet long and twenty feet high.  The figures are life size, and among them are a score of nude women, the choice companions of a pleasure-loving prince.  It is owing to this fact not less than to the marvelous skill of the artist that the celebrity of the picture is due, for an interesting part of the long battle over the nude in the art has been fought over this very painting.</p>
                            <p>Twenty years ago Mr. Griffiths secured it for an exhibition in Toronto.  One of the directors of the society under whose auspices the exhibition was given objected so strongly to the picture that he resigned his position when overborne by his colleagues.  It was due to the prudish sentiment of those opposed to the nude in art the Rochegrosse added a wreath of roses upon the central figure.  As originally exhibited the painting was minus this wreath.  It is almost unnecessary to add that the wreath added to the suggestiveness.</p>
                            <p>The story which the picture tells is morning in Babylon after a bacchanalian debauch.  Many of the inhabitants are asleep, but a few restless ones awake to find that the Macedonians are battling at the gate.  It has never been reproduced as a whole.  Several fragments have been reproduced, but none of them do justice to Rochegrosse's work.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Griffiths states in his letter to the Department of Exhibits that he intends to show the painting in some of the eastern cities to assist in defraying the expense necessary in securing it for Omaha.  He will forward it to Omaha at once.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Plan of the Building that is to Be Erected.</head>
                            <p>Architect Clas of Milwaukee, who is a member of the Wisconsin Exposition commission, will visit Omaha some time next week for the purpose of looking over the exposition grounds with a view of selecting a site for the handsome building which Wisconsin intends to erect on the grounds.  In this connection Mr. Clas has expressed his views in the Milwaukee Sentinel regarding the character of the building which he will suggest to his associates of the commission.  Mr. Clas has offered to donate a plan for a state building, and his suggestions in that line will probably be adopted.  In his interview in the Sentinel he says:</p>
                            <p>"I shall prepare a rough pencil sketch of a Wisconsin building, according to my own ideas, to be submitted to my associates upon the committee.  The building I have in my mind will be without reference to all ideas of the conventional club house.  I would have a building of the classical order, with a wide frieze, upon which would be a series of historic pictures in bas relief showing the development of the state.  In short, I would connect the building at Omaha with our semi-centennial, which will be celebrated at the same time in this state.  The building could have a glass roof, and be provided with a fish pond and cases containing fish from the state hatchery, which are the finest in the country, and would be a feature of the exposition.  I would have the space about the pond filled in with palms and flowers and trailing vines, and out of the midst of them should come boiling up  the famous spring waters of our Badger state.  At the four corners of the structure I would have large statues of commerce, industry, education and agriculture, and upon the pedestals on which they are placed, in brief outline, I would have the history of their development in the state.  Let the whole thing take upon itself the appearance of a winter garden.  What would it cost?  Not a great deal.  It would be a mere shell covered with staff&#8212;say $8,000 or $10,000 for the buildings, and $5,000 more for the statuary and furnishings.  I think I could get the four figures of education, industry, commerce and agriculture for about $400 each."</p>

                            <p>Superintendent Pearse of the public schools expects that the members of the executive committee of the National Educational association will visit Omaha within the next two weeks.  The visit of the committee is for the purpose of a personal inspection of the capacity of the city to entertain the 1898 convention of the association.  The Commercial club, the exposition management and other public bodies will be expected to cooperate in showing the members that Omaha is well able to provide the necessary accommodations.  The committee will also visit Salt Lake City, Los Angeles and Washington, and the selection of the location for the convention will depend very largely upon its comparative impression of the four cities.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The danger of having a man in a responsible position with the exposition who is there for the purpose of furthering his own ends is rapidly becoming apparent to the most casual observer.  That such a man is now connected with the Transmississippi Exposition there is but little doubt, and that man is Dion Geraldine.  There is direct proof that he is using his connection with the exposition for the purpose of paying off old obligations and taking every advantage of the situation.</p>
                            <p>It is the practice in all public work and in almost every kind of private work to have the architects open the bids for construction.  This is done on the theory that the architect is the man who knows more about this matter than any other and he should pass upon the bids.  But this sort of practice did not meet with the approval of the $500-a-month man from Chicago and he arrogated to himself the right to open bids and, for a time, assumed to handle them to suit himself.</p>
                            <p>When bids were first received Geraldine would take them into the remote precincts of his inner sanctum, where no person dared intrude, and there he would open the bids and make the tabulation to suit himself.  Evidence that there was a reason back of this secret manipulation of bids may be found without much difficulty.  Geraldine's arbitrary methods of handling bids caused a great uproar among the bidders and a storm of protest went up.  The executive committee finally took cognizance of the matter and ordered Geraldine to open the bids in the presence of the bidders and of the executive committee.</p>

                            <head type="sub">RELATIONS TO SMITH &amp; EASTMAN.</head>
                            <p>A report of the Bradstreet commercial agency for June 6, 1896, contains the following paragraph:</p>
                            <p>The Gates Iron Works Company a few days ago filed a bill in the circuit court against Smith &amp; Eastman to enjoin the commissioners of the sanitary district from paying $105,000 due on contract for work on section 14 of the Chicago drainage canal.  This suit is based on a claim of $5,650 for machinery.  The plaintiffs assert that the machinery in question was ordered by Dion Geraldine as agent for Smith &amp; Eastman, and the court is asked to hold that the defendant should pay his claim.  It is thought that this suit will be amicably adjusted.  For the defendant, Smith, it is said that he is not directly responsible for the bill and that Dion Geraldine had no relation to him in a business way except a <choice><sic>sub-constractor</sic><corr>sub-contractor</corr></choice> for a part of the work.  This Geraldine failed, and there are, it is said, a number of claims against him which cannot be collected, and that he is indebted for advances made by Smith, and that the latter seized the machinery in satisfaction of Geraldine's debt to him.</p>
                            <p>The firm of Smith &amp; Eastman mentioned in this report is the firm which has already secured the staff contracts on the Manufactures, Machinery, Mines and Agriculture
                            
                            <pb n="84" xml:id="TMISB03-084"/>
                            
                            buildings, and was the only bidder on the Art building.  In other words, the firm to which Dion Geraldine stands indebted for large sums has secured the contracts on the four largest buildings on the exposition grounds and is the only bidder on the only remaining building of any considerable size.  Leon Bonet secured the contract for the Administration building, a small job, and John L. Nelson &amp; Brother of Chicago secured the contract for the other small building, the Liberal Arts building.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PERVERSION OF FACTS.</head>
                            <p>It is in his ability to pervert facts, however, that Geraldine stands pre-eminent.  Convincing proof of one of his very slight efforts in this direction is to be found in the testimony given at the recent investigation of the charges preferred against him.  This was in connection with the charge that the ground plan of the bluff tract had been changed by Geraldine without the knowledge of the executive committee.  In reply to this charge Geraldine made the following statement:</p>
                            <p>"The supplementary plan of the bluff tract, drawn by Mr. Ulrich, was designed at a time when more money was expected for landscape work than is now in sight, and as a measure of economy I have been obliged to modify his plans with the full consent of Mr. Kirkendall, also Mr. Wattles while he filled Mr. Kirkendall's place, and the supervising architects have approved the changes suggested.  When they are completed they will be presented for the approval of the executive committee."</p>
                            <p>A little further along in his verbose explanation of this matter Mr. Geraldine said: "Mr. Ulrich regretted that he came here and intimated his desire to withdraw.  Finally, August 7, he wrote to me his final resignation, which is hereto attached.  I did not make this public, knowing that the withdrawal of a man like Mr. Ulrich would hurt the exposition."</p>
                            <p>The exposition records show that at the meeting of the executive committee held September 28 a motion by Mr. Rosewater was adopted, providing that Mr. Ulrich should be recalled, to stay as long as might be necessary.  Mr. Kirkendall was present and voted for this resolution, saying nothing whatever about Ulrich having resigned.  At a meeting of the executive committee held immediately after the investigation of Geraldine Mr. Kirkendall was shown the printed statement of Geraldine as quoted heretofore and expressed surprise at the statement therein regarding Ulrich.  He said he knew nothing whatever about the matter and had never heard of Ulrich resigning.  Mr. Kirkendall also said he had never given Geraldine any authority whatever to make any changes in the plan of the bluff tract and said he did not know that any changes had been made.  Mr. Wattles, who was present at this meeting, stated that he had ordered Geraldine to stop the grading which was being done on the bluff tract, but had not authorized him to make any changes in the plan made by Ulrich.</p>
                            <p>In this connection a statement is made by an Omaha man which goes to show that as late as the latter part of August Geraldine did not consider that Ulrich had resigned.  This man, whose name is Henry Broer, was an applicant for employment as gardener, in which capacity he had been in the employ of Herman Kountze for the last seven years.  He called repeatedly at Geraldine's office and was told each time to come in again.  Finally, in the latter part of August, Geraldine said to him: "Mr. Broer, this delay is not my fault; that cuss of an Ulrich should be here.  I want him to come and organize this thing and set you to work.  Come in at the end of the month."</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">LIES ABOUT TAMM.</head>
                            <p>While verbal proof of Geraldine's ability as a prevaricator is plentiful, there is also written proof, part of it made under oath, which adds to the mountain of evidence against his reliability.  Reference is had to the statements regarding W. H. Tamm.  During the investigation of the charges against Geraldine the accused stated, in reply to a direct question, that Tamm was "from Omaha."  In his sworn affidavit in the case brought in the municipal court by the Tobey Furniture company of Chicago to recover $85 for a little furniture bill bought by Geraldine in Chicago in February, 1895, Geraldine states twice that Tamm is a resident of Chicago and that on the date the affidavit was made, July 22, this year, Tamm was traveling in Europe and would not return to this country until about September, but the court was informed that Geraldine had positive knowledge that Tamm would be in Omaha about October 1.  If there was no further evidence in this matter the two statements are directly opposite and both could not be true, but the statement of Tamm shows that neither was true and Geraldine must have known it.  The statement also shows that Geraldine stated what was not true when he swore that Tamm was in Europe.  When this affidavit was made Tamm was in New York and left that city August 5 or 6 for Omaha, arriving here without delay and was at once given employment on the exposition by Geraldine, who wanted him for a witness in the case of the Tobey Furniture company.  W. H. Tamm says he is a resident of California, his wife residing there with her parents.  Tamm stated that his last vote had been cast in California for Benjamin Harrison for president, and that he had not lived in any state long enough since that time to acquire a vote.</p>

                            <head type="sub">TAMM'S OWN STORY.</head>
                            <p>The statement made by Tamm was as follows: "For the past five years I have been in the employ of Arthur Johnson &amp; Brother of this city, superintending their construction contracts in various parts of the country.  The headquarters of the firm has always been in Omaha and I have regarded this city as my headquarters for that reason, but I have never acquired a voting residence here or in any state except California during recent years.  The greater part of 1897 previous to August was spent by me between New York and Chicago, looking up evidence to be used in a suit now pending in the New York courts in which the firm of Arthur Johnson &amp; Brother are plaintiffs.  I hunted up evidence for the plaintiffs and gave testimony myself both in Chicago and New York, where the attorneys were taking depositions.  Portions of May, June, July and August were spent in New York and portions of the same month in Chicago, all the time on this business.  I was not in Europe during any time this year.  August 5 or 6 I left New York and came direct to Omaha."</p>
                            <p>The pay roll of the Buildings and Grounds department for the month of August shows that W. H. Tamm was employed fourteen days during that month as "superintendent of construction."  Although Geraldine in an affidavit filed July 31 swore that Tamm was in Europe and that he had been searching all over that country for him, yet he had no difficulty in finding him when he wanted him to take charge of the work on the exposition grounds, so as to be on hand as a witness for him when the Tobey case came up for trial.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Fifth warders last night expressed themselves in some very certain terms about Dion Geraldine, the autocratic superintendent of construction of the Transmississippi Exposition.  In one of the biggest mass meetings that has been held in the ward for a good many months those present passed first the following resolution:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That at a mass meeting of citizens held in Erfling hall Monday evening, October 18, we protest against the retention of Dion Geraldine as superintendent of construction of the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
                            <p>The remarks that led up to the passage of this resolution, which went through unanimously, must have made Geraldine's ears tingle.  But the resolution did not fully express the sentiment of the meeting and it was supplemented by another as follows which also passed without a negative vote:</p>
                            <p>Resolved further, That it is the sense of this meeting that the retention of Dion Geraldine as superintendent of construction of the Transmississippi Exposition jeopardizes the securing of the $100,000 binds for the aid of the exposition asked for at the coming election.</p>
                            <p>Even this latter resolution was not completely indicative of the feeling of the meeting.  The sentiment was still better expressed by another, which was not put to a vote because a more conservative element protested against it on the grounds that it was not an appropriate expression of a deliberative body and was something like a threat.  There is no doubt that if it had been put to a vote it would have been passed with but few votes against it.  This resolution was as follows:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That we hereby serve notice on the exposition directors that unless the said Dion Geraldine is discharged from the employ of the exposition company at once we will use our best endeavors to defeat the exposition bonds on election day.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WANTED IT MILDER.</head>
                            <p>When this latter resolution was introduced a few objected because they thought that it looked too much like a threat.  They desired rather that some resolution would be passed that would only imply that the meeting would combine against the bonds.  At the same time the very men who made the objections said outright that if Geraldine was not fired they would do all they could to defeat the bonds, as they would not vote for money for him to fritter away.  To satisfy the feeling thus expressed, the second resolution was introduced, and was passed without a dissenting vote.</p>
                            <p>As already stated the mass meeting at which the resolutions were passed was one of the biggest that has gathered in the Fifth ward for a considerable length of time.  Moreover, it was a sort of body that has to be listened to, as it was composed almost wholly of the taxpayers of the ward.  Laborers of all degrees, merchants, contractors, city officials, and other professions were represented in it.  A good many spoke, and only one man, J. O. Corby, said anything in favor of Geraldine, and he only did so because he feared that the whole thing was a "Rosewater scheme."</p>
                            <p>The meeting organized by electing Councilman Lobeck chairman and F. A. Kennedy, editor of the Western Laborer, secretary.  The latter introduced the resolutions and spoke in favor of them.  He said that he had been dumbfounded at the action of the exposition directors in supporting Geraldine and driving Rosewater out of the directory.  Rosewater had originated the idea of the exposition, had given it unlimited space in his paper, had worked unceasingly for it, had secured appropriations in the east that no other man could have gotten.  Yet he had been turned down when not a word had been said in defense of Geraldine.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kennedy spoke of the latter as an adventurer with not a straight hair in his head, who owned not a cent's worth of property in the city, had no interest here and would not hire Omaha men to do the work on the exposition ground.  He said he had been investigating Geraldine's career and record for four months, and knew everything that had been published about him was true.  He said in conclusion that if Geraldine was discharged he would vote and work for the bonds, but if he was retained he would do everything in his power to defeat the bond proposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">IMPORTING LABORING MEN.</head>
                            <p>Erlan E. Andrews, superintendent over the working force in the establishment of Farrell &amp; Co., was also outspoken in his utterances.  He said that many workingmen, including those employed under his direction, had pinched themselves to subscribe to stock to the exposition for the purpose that men out of work might secure employment on the grounds.  Since then it had become notorious that Geraldine would not allow any man to work there unless he was from Chicago.  This fact, together with his overbearing manner and the way he was allowed to expend exposition money in a reckless manner, had determined the men in the Farrell <choice><sic>establishmen</sic><corr>establishment</corr></choice> at least pay no more of their exposition stock subscriptions and to vote against the bond proposition if Geraldine was retained.  Mr. Andrews stated that he intended to vote against the proposition if Geraldine was not ousted.</p>
                            <p>Joseph Redman said that politically he was all the time against Rosewater, but in this instance he was with Rosewater because Rosewater was unqualifiedly in the right.  It was a business proposition to remove Geraldine, and he was in favor of saying so in no uncertain terms.  He stated that the exposition directors had not discharged Geraldine because they were afraid of public opinion.  He wanted to see the resolutions go through with a whoop in order to put some backbone into the directory.</p>
                            <p>W. E. Findley said that even the cash boys in downtown establishments had been solicited and had subscribed exposition stock for the purpose of bringing work to the city, but that all the expected good had been undone by Geraldine, who persisted in importing labor.  He said that many workingmen in the city would now be employed if the places had not been given to men who had been brought here.  He said he had carefully investigated public opinion and found that it was almost unanimously for Geraldine's discharge.  He said emphatically that he would work against the bond proposition if Geraldine was retained.  Mr. Findley introduced the compromise resolution that was passed in order to satisfy the more conservative element of the meeting.</p>

                            <head type="sub">CHICAGO RECORD SUFFICIENT.</head>
                            <p>Assistant City Clerk Holbrook gave it as his opinion that the retention of Geraldine meant undoubtedly the defeat of the bond proposition.  He said that Geraldine's record
                            
                            <pb n="85" xml:id="TMISB03-085"/>
                            
                            in Chicago and other places ought to be alone sufficient enough to bring about his discharge.</p>
                            <p>Frank P. Gould of the contracting firm of Rocheford &amp; Gould said that there was something decidedly rank about the manner in which contracts were being awarded.  He intimated pretty strongly that some inside tips were being given by Geraldine to favored contractors which shut out legitimate bids.  He spoke from experience, because he had made one bid.</p>
                            <p>Chris Dietrich, the liveryman, spoke very emphatically against the importation of a man at a salary of $500 a month, in return for which he did nothing except to act the part of a czar.  He insisted that there were dozens of men who could fill the position with a great deal more satisfaction to the general public.</p>
                            <p>George Smith, better known as "Doc" Smith, the old time civil engineer of the city, told about the snub he received at Geraldine's hands in connection with surveying the work on the grounds.  He also stated that Geraldine was playing too many favorites for the good of Omaha people.</p>
                            <p>G. C. Bassett of the contracting firm of Bassett &amp; Percival was another of the contractors who was of the opinion that it would be better for Omaha and the exposition if Geraldine was removed.</p>
                            <p>Councilman Lobeck was in favor of getting Geraldine out as soon as possible, and also of intimating to the exposition directory by the second resolution that they would get but little support for the exposition bonds if he was retained.</p>
                            <p>A good many other similar expressions were given utterance to in the course of the meeting.  When the sentiment was thus expressed the two resolutions were put to a vote and were unanimously passed.  They will be presented to the exposition directors at their meeting today.</p>

                            <p>The meeting also considered the matter of musical director for the exposition and adopted the following resolutions, which were introduced by G. W. Holbrook:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The chairman of the committee on ways and means of the Transmississippi and International Exposition has recommended as musical director one of our own townsmen, who has always been identified with every movement for the progress and advancement of our city, who is well qualified to fill said position; and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The selection of an Omaha man as such director will be a compliment to this city and help establish its reputation as a musical center; therefore</p>
                            <p>Resolved, by the citizens of the Fifth ward, That we endorse the recommendation of Thomas J. Pennell as musical <choice><sic>dierctor</sic><corr>director</corr></choice> and urge his election.</p>

                            <p>The wet weather yesterday delayed work at the exposition grounds, but this morning men were put to work as fast as an increased force could be handled.  On the Mines building the activity was especially marked.  Goldie &amp; Sons, the contractors, had about sixty men at work and preparations were being made to put up the tall timbers forming the outside walls of the huge structure, when more men will be put at work.  These long posts are rapidly being reared in their places, and as they assume vertical positions room is made for more men placing the braces and cross timbers.  It is expected that the building will be under roof within two weeks if the weather is propitious.</p>
                            <p>The remaining piles for the Machinery building are in the river and are being hauled to the grounds as fast as the bad condition of the road will allow.  The pile driver is at work and the work on the building is going ahead as fast as it can be pushed.  The timbers for the side walls are being hauled to the grounds, and as soon as the piles are driven and the floor laid these timbers will be put in position.  About twenty men are now employed on this building and an additional number will be put on as soon as the work bas progressed sufficiently.</p>
                            <p>Contractor Strehlow is proceeding very slowly with the Manufactures building.  He is delayed again by the failure of the Cady Lumber company to deliver the long posts as they are wanted.  The limit fixed in Strehlow's contract for the completion of this building expired today and the building is not half completed.</p>

                            <p>Illinois had appropriated $45,000 for state participation in the exposition and about one-half of the sum will be used in the erection of a state building.

                            <head type="sub">BAD BREAK IN THE EXPOSITION SEWER</head>
                            <head type="sub">Pipe that Geraldine Ordered Laid and Without Contract Bursts, Doing Much Damage to the Lagoon.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The expensive folly of paying a man $500 for superintending work about which he knows nothing, was very strongly in evidence on the exposition grounds yesterday.  A force of men were kept at work in the mud all yesterday afternoon and all of last night to cover up the telltale evidence and "keep it dark" in order that the public might not know that some of the work done under the direct inspection of Dion Geraldine had given out almost as soon as finished and had to be repaired at considerable expense to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The sewer which extends from the manhole in the center of the broad basin at the west end of the lagoon on the Kountze tract to the city sewer on Twenty-fourth street burst yesterday and the water in the lagoon was lowered nearly two feet before it was repaired and the escape of the water stopped.  The bottom of the lagoon east of Twentieth street is totally bare and the water from the city mains has been turned on again to make good the loss of thousands of gallons lost through Geraldine's incompetency and ignorance.</p>
                            <p>This sewer was constructed by Dion Geraldine without a contract, the work being done by day's labor under the direct supervision of Geraldine, who bought the pipe and employed the men.  The plans for the sewer were made by the city engineer, but that official had nothing to do with the work of putting it in.  This was one of the jobs where Geraldine made one of his famous claims about "breaking the contractors' ring" and doing the work for less than it could be done by competitive bidding.</p>
                            <p>This was early in the progress of the exposition, and the executive committee was finally induced to allow Geraldine to have his own way.  An incident occurred at this time, however, which aroused suspicions that <choice><sic>Geraldine'e</sic><corr>Geraldine's</corr></choice> regard for the truth was not as marked as it might have been.  In reply to close questioning by the committee at the meeting at which this matter was under discussion Geraldine stated that he had already secured competitive bids for the necessary pipe.  He was asked for the figures, and was then compelled to confess that he had figures from only one firm.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">DAMAGES THE LAGOON.</head>
                            <p>The portion of the sewer extending from the lagoon to the Twenty-fourth street sewer was intended for use in caring for the overflow and also to drain the lagoon when occasion should require that to be done.  Twenty-four-inch pipe was used for this purpose, the sewer extending in a southeasterly direction from the manhole to Twenty-fourth street.  This pipe burst at a point just inside the wall of sheet piling which lines the lagoon and the water rushed through this hole in a perfect torrent.  Before the break could be repaired the surface of the water in the lagoon had fallen about two feet and a great hole was washed in the bottom of the lagoon.</p>
                            <p>A gang of men was put to work as soon as the break was discovered and the work of making the repairs pushed as fast as possible, both to stop the water from running out of the basin and also to cover up the defects so that no prying outsider would discover what had happened.  A raft of planks was constructed and the ditch outside of the wall of the lagoon opened for a distance of about ten feet.  By working all of last night the break was repaired and the hole filled in again.</p>
                            <p>The break must have been caused by faulty construction of the sewer.  A leaky joint combined with the seepage of the water through the bottom of the lagoon into the sewer trench, had caused the pipe to settle at a joint and the pressure caused by this settling broke a piece out of the pipe.  A good authority on sewer construction stated that the joints should have been thoroughly cemented so as to prevent the water from leaking out at the joints and that the bottom of the trench should have been thoroughly tamped at each joint to guard against settling.  It was also stated that the fact that the break had occurred was evidence that the work had been improperly and carelessly done.</p>

His suggestions are largely in line with the suggestions heretofore made by Manager Rosewater, and embody a collection of living specimens of all the remaining Indian tribes in the west, with their tepees, utensils of all kinds, prehistoric and recent, and collections of Indian relics and curios, etc.  He suggests that the tepees be <choice><sic>ararranged</sic><corr>arranged</corr></choice> in a circle and that in the center be a log "block house," a familiar sight during frontier days, in which should be shown the relics and other articles of exhibit.

                            <head type="sub">Coroner Burket on Number of Members Who Will Attend.</head>
                            <p>Coroner H. K. Burket has returned from Milwaukee after a successful effort in assisting in securing the next annual meeting of the National Funeral Directors' association for this city.  In connection with the subject he said this morning: "The Nebraska delegation, consisting of James Heaton of Lincoln, Patrick Heafey of Omaha, Peter Bell of Norfolk and myself, worked hard for the convention.  We encountered a great deal of opposition from the start.  Besides Omaha there were several other competitors in the field, prominent among which were Niagara Falls and Columbus, O.  It was argued that the convention had already been held in this city in 1891, and that there were many other cities in the country which on this account were entitled to recognition.  We had a lot of exposition advertising material with us and performed good missionary work with it.  When the subject came to a vote we carried the day at the first poll."</p>
                            <p>The association numbers about 500 members.  There will probably be 300 in attendance upon the convention held in this city.  The date has not as yet been settled upon, although the regular time for meeting is in October.  This will probably be changed to an earlier date on account of the exposition.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The special meeting of the Board of Directors of the exposition, held yesterday afternoon, was a long and stormy session at which several matters of importance were acted upon, but no progress made towards clearing the sky of the threatening clouds which have been hovering about the horizon for the last three weeks.  A second vote of confidence in the executive committee, the officers of the exposition, and everybody else was passed; a resolution providing for the immediate discharge of Dion Geraldine was referred to the executive committee; and a resolution providing that the union scale of wages should be paid on all future contracts, and that eight hours should constitute a day's work, was laid safely away until after the election.</p>
                            <p>Forty of the fifty members of the board were present, and the session lasted from five minutes after 4 o'clock until 6:30 p. m.  Nearly the whole time was taken up in discussing the Geraldine matter, and many of the members had gone when Director Hoctor sprung his labor resolution just before adjournment.</p>
                            <p>As soon as the roll was called, General Manderson secured the floor and said he desired to introduce a resolution before any other business should be transacted.  He declared that action on this resolution laid at the base of the success of the enterprise in which all present were interested.  He made a lengthy speech expressing regret that the dissensions in the organization had gained publicity.  He disclaimed appearing as the champion of wither Geraldine or Manager Rosewater, but declared that the exposition did not depend for its success upon any one man.  Charges had been preferred against Geraldine, and if these were true he should be discharged without delay.  He reviewed the investigation by the special committee and the conclusion of the committee, in which he expressed the greatest confidence.  He said the fight was still going on, and confessed to the greatest amazement when informed by the secretary of the small amount of subscriptions paid in during the last month.  He declared harmony must be restored, and to bring this about offered the resolution he had prepared.</p>

                            <head type="sub">RESOLUTION OF COMPROMISE.</head>
                            <p>The resolution was preceded by a long preamble, expressing regret at the conflict between those charged with carrying on the exposition; endorsed the action of the executive committee in appointing the special committee to investigate the charges preferred against Geraldine, and expressed the conviction that the findings of the special committee were just and true and worthy of credit and belief.  The resolution approved the findings of the special committee and affirmed the confidence of the Board of Directors in the president and members of the executive committee, expressing the conviction that if mistakes had happened they had been of minor importance, and declaring the intention of the Board of Directors to hold up the hands of the committee and to help it to carry on the work which means so much for the state and the community.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater replied to General Manderson.  He said he regarded the resolution as unnecessary.  A resolution of thanks had already been tendered the executive committee, and the directors at their last meeting had given even stronger emphasis to the findings of the special committee by refusing to adopt a resolution to discharge Geraldine.  Mr. Rosewater called special attention to the fact that the conclusion of the special committee does not recommend the retention of Geraldine, but merely states that if he is retained more stringent measures should be adopted to compel him to live up to the rules.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">WHAT CONSTITUTES A TRAITOR.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater called attention to statements appearing in the World-Herald accusing him of being a traitor to Omaha.  He declared that if it was treason to expose rottenness and corruption he gloried in being so branded.  Replying to Mr. Manderson, Mr. Rosewater said the gentleman had not been in the city very much of late and evidently did not understand the situation.  He alluded to the great feeling of unrest and suspicion among the laboring people of the city with reference to the exposition management.  He said the publicity to which reference had been made did not start in The Bee, but had been discussed and printed in other papers long before anything appeared in The Bee.  He referred briefly to the action taken by the various labor organizations and other indications of distrust which have been apparent for some time.  Mr. Rosewater denied that he had done anything to bring about the defeat of the county exposition bonds, as had been charged.  On the contrary he said he had done more to bring the bond proposition to its present state than any other man.  He reminded the directors that he had been compelled to take hold of the bond matter during the legislative session, notwithstanding it was a matter of promotion and did not belong in his department.  He had had the bill drawn and personally took it to Lincoln and had it introduced in the legislature and aided in securing its passage.  He said that later he had had petitions prepared and circulated in order to get the matter properly before the county commissioners and had been left by the other members of the executive committee to work it out with the county so the voters of the county could express their sentiments on it.  He asked if this action on his part <choice><sic>indica-</sic><corr>indicate</corr></choice> that he was opposed to the bonds.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">PUBLIC LOSING CONFIDENCE.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater warned the directors, however, that no matter how many fine resolutions of confidence were passed, such action would not restore confidence in the management of the exposition with the general public.  He explained that he meant to cast no reflections on any member of the executive committee but he said that the public had lost confidence entirely in Geraldine and he must be turned out before the public would have any confidence in the way things were managed.  Mr. Rosewater said it was an old principle of law that when a man lied about one thing he could not be believed about anything.  Charges of lying had been printed in the newspapers, which could not be denied, as they were matters of record in the courts and such rascality must be overturned if public confidence was to be restored.  The thing necessary to be done was to reorganize the management.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater proceeded to explain what he meant by reorganization.  He said no exposition has been carried on without a director general.  In the Transmississippi Exposition, up to this time, each department had been carried on entirely by subordinates, except in the Publicity and Transportation departments, for the reason that no manager of a department had ever had experience in the business of the respective departments.  In all former expositions, on the contrary, a director general had been in direct charge of all departments, working under the direction of the executive committee.  Mr. Rosewater expressed his firm conviction that this form of organization would have to be adopted for the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
                            <p>Leaving this subject Mr. Rosewater said he did not care to continue as a member of the executive committee unless the board would call a halt upon the extravagant and incompetent administration of affairs by Geraldine.  He said he would do all in his power to assist in building up the exposition, but he would not muzzle The Bee and suppress matters of notoriety and scandalous manipulation.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">OPPOSITION TO THE BONDS.</head>
                            <p>Referring again to the bonds to be submitted at the coming election Mr. Rosewater warned the board that the bonds would unquestionably be lost unless the directory acted promptly.  He analyzed the vote which his experience showed him would be cast on the board proposition and reached the conclusion that the vote outside of Omaha would be about 4,400 against the bonds, making it necessary two-thirds.  He said the entire weight of organized labor had already declared against the bonds, and something should be done at once to allay the feeling of the public.  If the board passed fine resolutions and voted each member a medal it would not help matters in the least&#8212;the bonds could not be carried unless the confidence of the people of Omaha in the exposition management was restored.</p>
                            <p>This lengthy statement of the opposite sides of the matter was followed by a discussion in which a number of directors took part, being mostly cross-fire of questions referring to details already discussed.</p>
                            <p>Following this Director Youngs, the representative of organized labor, said he didn't suppose anything he could say would have any weight with the element which seemed determined to support Geraldine at all hazards, but he merely wanted to say that the public knew perfectly well that Geraldine was the wrong man for the place.  He said Geraldine had created bad feeling among the working classes and had openly discriminated against Omaha labor.  Mr. Youngs said he had in his possession an affidavit of a laboring man showing that Geraldine had tried to hold him up in order to get a chance to work on the exposition, and he believed other affidavits of a similar nature could be obtained.  In conclusion Mr. Youngs offered the following resolution as a substitute for the resolution then pending before the board:</p>
                            <p>"Whereas, The stockholders, organized labor, and the public in general, have protested against the longer retention of Dion Geraldine as superintendent of construction of the Transmississippi and International Exposition; therefore be it</p>
                            <p>"Resolved, That the services of Dion Geraldine be and they are hereby dispensed with."</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">MANDERSON RESOLUTION ADOPTED.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Manderson raised the point of order that it was not germane to the resolution before the board.  The point was sustained by President Wattles and the roll was called on the Manderson resolution.  Mr. Rosewater refused to vote and Youngs' was the only vote recorded against the resolution, the result being 37 ayes, 1 no.</p>
                            <p>Director Youngs then called up his resolution, but before he could move its adoption Mr. Manderson moved that it be referred to the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Youngs rather warmly insisted that courtesy would have dictated that he be given the opportunity to move the adoption of the resolution, but a vote was called for at once and the result showed thirty-two votes in favor of referring and eight against it.  Several of the latter explained that they voted against referring because they thought the matter should be settled at once.  The eight so voting were Hoctor, Kilpatrick, Kirkendall, Rosewater, Thompson, Wattles, Yost and Youngs.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Manderson then asked Mr. Rosewater if his resignation had been withdrawn.  Mr. Rosewater replied that it had not.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Manderson asked if he would insist on its acceptance or whether the reference of the Geraldine matter to the executive committee would not be satisfactory to him.  Mr. Rosewater said that he would be willing to keep on working until the next meeting of the executive committee and lay further evidence before that committee if the committee would take prompt action.  He said the resignation was conditional and if the conditions were complied with he would be willing to withdraw it.</p>
                            <p>Several members of the directory spoke strongly against allowing Mr. Rosewater to leave the committee, and the discussion on this point became general, ending in the withdrawal of the resignation pending action on the part of the executive committee.</p>
                            </div3>              
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">TRY TO ENLARGE THE COMMITTEE.</head>
                            <p>After this action the members commenced to go away, taking it for granted that no further business would be transacted.  At this point, however, Mr. Wharton addressed the board on the question of allowing President Wattles a vote on the executive committee.  He advocated taking action that would bring about this result, and Mr. Hitchcock moved that the by-laws be so amended as to make the president a member of the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Lindsey of the executive committee opposed this action, saying it was unnecessary, that the president had already had a vote in case of a tie in the committee, and that the proposed action would destroy the present plan of organization.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Youngs moved that the matter lay over until the next meeting.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Manderson thought the time would soon come when the present plan of organization would have to be changed and a director general chosen.  Before that was done, he said, he would want to investigate the relations which would exist between the positions of president and director general, and he advised that the matter be laid over until some future time.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles explained that under the by-laws the president had no power and was rather an anomaly.  He insisted that he should be given some authority and that action should be taken at this time, so that he would have authority to say something and so something, instead of being held responsible for the conduct of affairs without having any voice in the management.</p>
                            <p>At this point an examination of the by-laws showed that amendments could only be made at regular meetings.  The president then ruled the whole matter as out of order.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">HOCTOR'S LABOR RESOLUTION.</head>
                            <p>Again the members started for the door, but Director Hoctor, sprang another resolution, providing that in all further contracts for work on the exposition grounds and in all work done on those grounds eight hours shall constitute a working day, and providing also that the scale of wages fixed by the labor organizations in force October 18, 1897, should be the scale by which all laborers and mechanics should be paid.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Youngs at once seconded the motion to adopt this resolution, and there was fully a score of hurried consultations in various parts of the room.  Mr. Hoctor was
                            
                            <pb n="87" xml:id="TMISB03-087"/>
                            
                            surrounded by a number of directors, and he then expressed his willingness to let the resolution be referred to the executive committee for investigation.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Youngs said it was useless to refer the resolution to the executive committee, as other resolutions of similar import had been so referred and had been buried.  He explained that the resolution, as drawn, would not prevent the employment of any man, regardless of whether he belonged to a labor organization or not.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Montgomery moved that it lie over until the next meeting of the directory.  This meant that the resolution would be buried until after election, as the next regular meeting of the board will not occur until November 12.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Youngs opposed the delay, but Mr. Wharton argued that it was late, and the directors were getting hungry, and no harm would be done by letting the resolution go over two weeks.</p>
                            <p>Finally a motion by Mr. Hitchcock that the resolution be referred to a special committee to report at the next meeting of the directors, whether this particular resolution, or any resolution of similar import, could be adopted without prejudicing or interfering with the contracts already in force on exposition work, was adopted.  The chair appointed as this committee Directors Hitchcock, Montgomery and Hoctor.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Visit Grounds and Express Surprise Over the Progress of the Work Done Preparatory to Holding the Big Show.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Twelve members of the Illinois Exposition commission arrived in Omaha this morning on the Burlington train which arrived from Chicago at 8 o'clock.  They were met at the depot by President Wattles and Directors Babcock, Markel and Evans of the Transmississippi and International Exposition and escorted to the Millard hotel.</p>
                            <p>The party comprised Clark E. Carr, president of the commission and formerly United States minister to Denmark under the Harrison administration; William H. Harper of Chicago, chairman of the executive committee; C. E. Hambleton of Chicago, secretary of the commission; John M. Smyth, Joseph P. Wheadon, L. O. Goddard, Chicago; George W. Wall, Duquoin; William B. Brinton, La Salle; William H. Stead, Ottawa; Randolph Smith Flora; Charles C. Williams, Hoopeston, and C. H. Keeler, Dixon.  The party was accompanied by W. C. Gregory of the Chicago Tribune and C. L. Pierce of the Inter Ocean.</p>
                            <p>After depositing their traveling paraphernalia at the hotel the visitors were escorted to the headquarters of the exposition in the Paxton block, where they were shown through the various offices and departments, after which the offices of the supervising architects were visited.  The architects, Messrs. Walker and Kimball, showed the visitors through the draughting rooms, where the plans of the grounds and the various buildings were inspected and discussed.  The visiting commissioners expressed the greatest satisfaction at the many evidences of substantial progress which were apparent on every hand, and took great interest in inspecting the drawings, asking many questions of a pertinent nature and showing insight into the requirements of the situation.  The general arrangement of the grounds as shown by the drawings was heartily complimented, and a number of the visitors confessed to a feeling of surprise at the completeness of the detail drawings and the other architectural arrangements.</p>
                            <p>After half an hour spent in this way, the members of the party mounted two tallyho coaches and were driven to The Bee office, where the offices of the Publicity department were visited and a call made upon Manager Rosewater.  The visitors were supplied with literature and were greatly interested in examining the bird's-eye drawing of the exposition ground which was recently completed.  The Bee office was next visited, the visitors inspecting the mechanical department of the newspaper, after which they descended to the fifth floor and made a brief call upon General Coppinger, commanding the Department of the Platte.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PLEASED WITH THE GROUNDS.</head>
                            <p>These formalities disposed of, the coaches were again mounted and a trip made to the grounds.  Distributed among the visitors on top of the coaches were Directors Babcock, Kirkendall, Reed, Evans, Markel, Kilpatrick and Lindsey, Mr. W. S. Poppleton and Architects Walker and Kimball.  The route was via Sixteenth street and Sherman avenue, the various points of interest along the way being pointed out and information regarding the exposition being dispensed as the occasion offered.</p>
                            <p>When the grounds were reached the members of the party were driven into the main court, coming into full view of the grand court from between the approaches to the viaduct.  The first view of the main court presented a busy scene.  The sun was shining brightly and the weather was all that could have been desired.  The bracing effect of the cool air seemed to make itself felt on all sides, and the large gangs of men working on the main buildings seemed to be imbued with the spirit of energy that permeated the atmosphere.  The huge frames which are soon to blossom forth into dazzling white palaces were covered with men working like beavers, huge timbers were being raised into position and the snorting piledrivers threw out clouds of smoke as the huge hammers were raised to administer the blows which sent the long piles into the earth.  Large gangs of men were working on every hand&#8212;a gang putting in water pipes, another preparing the ground for another main building.  Some men were making roadways and others were working on the incline about the lagoon.  Scores of men were at work unloading the lumber from the dozens of cars standing on the exposition tracks and hundreds of mechanics were working at top speed to prepare the timbers for the huge buildings.</p>
                            <p>The visitors partook of the enthusiasm which prevailed on every side.  They expressed the greatest gratification at the energy which was being displayed in bringing order out of the chaos and were enthusiastic over the outlook for a magnificent architectural display in the grand court.  Plans of the grounds and pamphlets containing the cuts of the main buildings were examined and thus the visitors formed in their minds mental pictures of the completed scene, giving expression in no uncertain terms to the flattering prospect for a magnificent display.</p>

                            <p>After the scene from the head of the lagoon had been fully enjoyed the coaches made the circle of the body of water and then the bluff tract was visited.  The broad valley of the Missouri was brought into full view from the top of the coaches and the visitors enjoyed the beautiful sight to the utmost, the ragged bluffs on the Iowa side being softened by a misty veil of haze which but added to the beauty of the scene.</p>
                            <p>Here the plans of the ground were again brought into play and the most favorable location for the Illinois building was discussed.  The members of the commission were most favorably impressed with the beauty of the bluff tract and studied the plan very carefully.  Many of them were strongly in favor of locating the Illinois building opposite that of Nebraska, about midway between the viaduct across Sherman avenue and the Horticulture building.  On this site the Illinois building would face the east, giving a full view of the Missouri valley and being one of the most conspicuous locations on the ground.  No action was taken officially, however, and the party then visited the north tract, where it is proposed to locate the agricultural and irrigation exhibits, the live stock and the Indians.  but little time was spent on this portion of the grounds.  The staff shops of Leo Bonet and Smith &amp; Eastman were looked into and then the party mounted the coaches for the return trip.  They were taken to the Millard hotel, where, at 2 o'clock, they were entertained at dinner by members of the exposition directory.  The dinner was followed by a flow of good spirits and mutual congratulation.  The visitors expressed the friendship which Illinois entertains for Nebraska on account of the handsome manner in which the latter responded to Illinois' request for co-operation in the World's fair, and the Nebraska contingent assured the visiting commission that the people of this state appreciate the royal manner in which Illinois has indicated its interest in the Transmississippi and International Exposition.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>OMAHA, Oct. 19.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee: I noticed in last evening's Bee that from statements made the inference is that our firm is in collusion with Dion Geraldine in obtaining contracts for staff work for the exposition here.  The statement is made that Dion Geraldine owes a large amount of money to Smith &amp; Eastman on some subcontract he had with them on the drainage canal and that the same Smith &amp; Eastman have secured all the principal contracts for staff let by Mr. Geraldine for the exposition.</p>
                            <p>I will say that I had no interest in section 14 of the drainage canal only for a few days and no labor was put on it during that time.  Mr. Geraldine never owed me a cent in this life, and the only business connection I ever had with him before coming here was at the World's fair.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith being busy on his farm in Missouri has left the bidding on the work here wholly to me.  Our bid on the Manufactures building was about two-thirds the amount of the next lowest bidder; the same is true on the Machinery building and we were about 25 per cent lower than the next reliable bidder on the Agricultural building.</p>
                            <p>It seems to me that if Mr. Geraldine was manipulating the figures so as to throw the work into our hands our bids would have been much larger.  As a matter of fact I alone am responsible for the amounts of our bids and will say further that I know of no staff work ever done at the prices we are taking it at, and if other bidders have quit bidding it is because they cannot meet our uniformly low prices.</p>
                            <p>If the owner of The Bee can find parties willing to take the staff work at our prices or less it is his duty, as a friend and promoter of the exposition, to bring them forward.</p>

                            <p>NOTE BY THE EDITOR: The extract printed by The Bee was from a report from Bradstreet's commercial agency and stated that Smith, of the firm Smith &amp; Eastman, claimed that Geraldine was greatly indebted to him.  The Bee has not said directly or by inference that the bids of Smith &amp; Eastman on staff work are excessive, but has pointed out that with Geraldine indebted and under other obligations to the senior member of the firm, there is no assurance that the successful bidders will be required to live up to the plans and specifications.</p>

                            <p>At the regular meeting of the journeymen, plumbers, gas and steam fitters last evening the following resolutions were adopted:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, It has been currently reported for some time past that one Dion Geraldine, an imported aristocrat who is in the employ of the Transmississippi and International Exposition as superintendent of construction, has been discriminating against Omaha laboring men and Omaha contractors in favor of those from other cities; and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, It has been shown before an investigating committee that the said Geraldine has exceeded his authority as such superintendent of construction in various ways; therefore be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That we, the plumbers, gas and steam fitters of local association No. 17 of United States and Canada, in regular session, do hereby condemn the action of the committee in exonerating the said Geraldine of the charges substantiated at the investigation; and be it further</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That we commend Mr. Edward Rosewater for the stand he has taken in exposing the actions of the said Geraldine, and that we pledge him our moral support in his effort to prevent the squandering of the people's money by the said Geraldine and his pals; and be it further</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That we will use our united efforts on election day to defeat the $100,000 bond issue if this objectionable superintendent is not removed.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to the two leading daily newspapers of this city.</p>

                            <head type="sub">LOCATED CLOSE TO NEBRASKA STRUCTURE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Members of the Commission Feel Favorable to Exposition and Will Do Much to Make it a Grand Success.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Yesterday afternoon, after studying the situation from different points of view, the Illinois Exposition commission united in declaring that a level spot just north of the Nebraska building and nearly on a line with it was the most suitable spot for the Illinois building.  The members selected a location about 200x250 feet in size and expressed a desire to have that particular spot reserved for their state building.  This was agreed to by Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, and the point may be regarded as settled, although no official action has yet been taken.</p>
                            <p>After this question was disposed of the party mounted the coaches and were shown over the north tract of the grounds, passing through this to Twenty-fourth street, from where the return trip was made to the hotel.</p>
                            <p>At 2 o'clock the entire party of visitors, together with a number of the exposition directors, sat down to a dinner in the private dining room at the Millard.  A most delicious and dainty repast was served, and over the coffee and cigars the hosts and guests exchanged compliments, mixed with matters of cold business.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WATTLES EXTENDS A WELCOME.</head>
                            <p>President Wattles of the Transmississippi Exposition called the assembly to order when the dainties had been disposed of and welcomed the visitors to the city in a short business-like talk.  He said the people of Nebraska had looked with interest toward Illinois during the last six months and had been greatly pleased to see the manner in which the request of the transmississippi region to the people of Illinois had been recognized by a substantial appropriation for state participation in the exposition.  He said the people of the west do not expect to equal the great World's fair in the extent and grandeur of their exposition, but they proposed to gather together a few of the resources of this vast region and would invite the people of the world to come and see what the garden spot of the world could produce.  Chicago had been the market of this entire section for years, and the wealth obtained from the west had gone to build up the great city on the lakes, and the people of the prairies thought it but right that the people of Illinois should assist in making the exposition a great show.</p>
                            <p>President Carr of the Illinois commission replied to President Wattles for the visitors, expressing the pleasure they had experienced at the reception which had been tendered them and especially at the most liberal terms upon which they had been tendered the use of the site selected for the Illinois building.  He said it was not possible for people to feel more kindly than the Illinois commission felt toward the people of Omaha and the members of the exposition management.  The president then presented several questions of detail regarding the rules of the exposition which he requested be explained in order that the members of the Illinois commission might be prepared to make a plain statement of the case to the people of their respective districts when they returned to their homes.</p>

                            <p>The matters referred to by the president were explained in full by the various members of the executive committee, and then a number of the visiting commissioners were called on to make brief remarks.</p>

                            <head type="sub">HAD SONS IN THE WEST.</head>
                            <p>George E. Wall of Duquoin, third vice president of the Illinois commission and a lawyer by profession, expressed the delight of the visitors with what they had seen and the manner in which they had been entertained.  He said the people of Illinois had a paternal and fraternal feeling for Nebraska, because many of their sons and daughters had left the parent state to cast their fortunes on the broad prairies of the west.  They were anxious that the exposition should be a success and were ready and willing to do anything in their power to make it a success.  He promised that Illinois would bring an exhibit that could not be equaled by any other state.</p>
                            <p>L. O. Goddard, an attorney of Chicago and until recently one of the vice presidents of the Burlington road, expressed his appreciation of the manner in which the commission had been entertained and said he was satisfied from what he had seen of the plans for the exposition and the men who were to carry them out that the exposition could not but be a great success.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles called on Manager Rosewater, who said he wished to make acknowledgment, in the name of the people of Nebraska, to the people of Illinois for the generous and royal treatment which the people of Chicago and the legislature of the state had extended to the delegation which visited Illinois last spring in the interest of an appropriation for an Illinois building and exhibit.  He reviewed the courtesies which had been extended and said thanks were especially due Mr. Goddard for saving the appropriation bill when it was hanging in the balance.  Mr. Rosewater also complimented Governor Tanner upon the public spirit he had displayed in signing the exposition bill when it was found that the appropriations exceeded the levy, thereby depriving local interests of appropriations in order that the state might be represented at the exposition of the resources of the great west.  He assured the visiting commissioners that when the time came for actual details of business they would find that the exposition management was willing and ready to meet them more than half way in making arrangements that would be mutually satisfactory.</p>
                            <p>Mutual compliments and expressions of good will, together with hearty assurances of earnest co-operation, were exchanged on both sides, mixed with discussions on topics of business interest until the hour arrived when some of the visitors were compelled to take their leave in order to start for home.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PLEASED WITH THE SITE.</head>
                            <p>The members of the commission who remained in town spent the morning quietly at the hotel, talking over exposition matters with members of the local executive committee.  The visitors repeated many times their favorable impressions and their entire satisfaction with the site which had been selected for the Illinois building.  They declared that the location could not be improved upon and said the plans for the building would be selected as soon as the members returned to Chicago.  The building committee has already about twenty plans before it and one of these will be selected at once.</p>
                            <p>The members of the building committee are: James P. Whedon, Martin Kingman, Oscar P. Traherd, Randolph Smith and C. C. Williams.  The site selected for the Illinois building is about 200 feet back from the edge of the bluff, overlooking the Missouri valley and the bluffs on the Iowa side.  It is slightly higher than the site on which the Nebraska building is being erected, and is one of the most commanding positions on the bluff tract.  It will be within about 200 feet of one of the railway entrances leading up from the level below the bluff and will be only a short distance from the grand plaza at the east end of the viaduct across Sherman avenue.</p>
                            <p>The members of the Illinois commission are all men of considerable importance in their state and many of them have attained distinction in political life.  The president of the commission, Clark E. Carr of Galesburg, was minister to Denmark under President Harrison, and has been prominent in the politics of the state for many years.  He held the position of postmaster of Galesburg for about thirty years and has several times been a candidate for the office of governor of Illinois and for United States senator.</p>
                            <p>William H. Harper, chairman of the executive committee, is one of the most prominent elevator and grain men in Chicago.</p>
                            <p>George E. Wall of Duquoin, third vice president of the commission, is one of the best known lawyers in Illinois.</p>
                            <p>C. E. Hambleton of Chicago, secretary, is an insurance man and also enjoys the distinction of being an ex-alderman in the Windy City.</p>
                            <p>John M. Smyth is the owner of one of the largest furniture establishments in Chicago, and is also chairman of the Cook County republican central committee.</p>
                            <p>L. O. Goddard of Chicago is a prominent lawyer and was until recently a vice president of the Burlington road.</p>
                            <p>James P. Whedon of Chicago is also a lawyer of wide reputation, as is William H. Stead of Ottawa.</p>
                            <p>William B. Brinton of Peru is secretary of the Peru Plow company, a large manufacturer of agricultural implements, and was for several years the United States marshal for the southern district of Illinois.</p>
                            <p>Randolph Smith of Flora is a banker, and Charles C. Williams of Hoopeston is a capitalist.  Mr. Williams formerly resided in Omaha and has a wide circle of acquaintances here.</p>
                            <p>C. H. Keeler of Dixon is a member of the newspaper profession, having been for many years the owner of one of the leading papers in his section.  This comprises the party who visited Omaha, the other seven members of the commission being detained elsewhere.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi association will have another luncheon and pleasant session at the Grand hotel this evening.  The meeting will be held in the cafe of the hotel on the sixth floor and will be called at 8 o'clock.  Luncheon will be served during the evening.</p>
                            <p>The members of the association have found that these meetings have a double value.  They get the members together and owing to their informal character encourage a sociability that is productive of origination and exchange of ideas.  At the last meeting a number of new ideas were discussed and several of them approved by the committee.  To make them effective they require immediate action and for this reason it is desired to have a full meeting of the committee tonight.</p>

                            <p>P. D. Denney of Spokane, Wash., has been appointed commercial agent of the Department of Exhibits for his section of country.</p>
                            <p>The Singer Manufacturing company has applied for 1,024 feet of space in the Manufactures building and has indicated the exact location it wished.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Buildings and Grounds is preparing to take up its headquarters on the exposition grounds and will occupy the small cottage standing in the center of the bluff tract.</p>
                            <p>The working force on the Nebraska building was increased this morning by adding five men, making thirty in all.  The sills and floor are nearly completed and the superstructure will be raised early next week.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Promotion has issued a formal invitation to the National Women's Christian Temperance union, which meets in Buffalo October 26, asking the convention to fix upon Omaha for the place of the next meeting.</p>
                            <p>The Van Dorn iron works of Cleveland, O., has applied for 1,728 feet, in which to erect for exhibition a model jail.  The use of the jail will be tendered the exposition authorities free of charge in order to demonstrate its efficiency.</p>
                            <p>The bird's-eye picture of the exposition grounds which was made by Artist Austen has been sent by the Department of Publicity to an establishment where half-tone cuts will be made from it for publication in the newspapers and magazines.</p>
                            <p>The piles for the Machinery building are being driven as fast as possible and the floor is keeping pace with the piledriver.  The south wall of this building will be raised some time tomorrow and as many men will be put on as can be handled to advantage.</p>
                            <p>The bluff tract has been seeded with blue grass seed, a ton of the seed being used for the purpose.  People who have learned by experience predict that this seed will be entirely wasted, as fully three years are required to make a presentable lawn by seeding with blue grass.</p>
                            <p>Smith &amp; Eastman have established a staff shop in the Manufactures building and have put a force of men at work making the ornamental staff for this building.  A large portion of the staff for this building has been made for some time, and it is being bung in the inside of the large elaborate dome, giving an idea of the elaborate ornamentation which will distinguish this structure.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GERALDINE'S BARGAIN-COUNTER PIPING</head>
                            <head type="sub">Lagoon Will Have to Be Drained to Permit of Repairs, Entailing Great Expense and Loss of Time.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>A second break occurred in the outlet of the lagoon at the exposition grounds yesterday.  Although the flow of water was temporarily stopped when it was first ascertained that the outlet was worthless, it proved to be ineffectual.  The temporary dam was made by digging down inside the planking of the lagoon and by smashing several sections of the twenty-four inch sewer pipe which formed the outlet.  This system of repairs under the direction of Superintendent Geraldine was further perfected by forcing into this hole in the ground a large number of sacks filled with sand.  For a time the flow from the lagoon ceased, but as soon as the sand became saturated the water continued to filter through it and into the section of outlet still remaining.</p>
                            <p>As a consequence the water in the lagoon fell nearly six inches more yesterday, and is still oozing away.  Seeing that his work had proved futile the superintendent passed the whole affair up as a bad job and called in Contractor J. F. Daley to take charge of it.  Although the outlet was originally laid by Mr. Daley he confessed himself nonplussed last evening when he made an attempt to make the lagoon water tight.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">DALEY GIVES IT UP.</head>
                            <p>With the assistance of a man Mr. Daley opened up the manhole leading into the outlet about forty feet distant from the lagoon and attempted to stop the outflow by cramming sacks of sand into the twenty four inch pipe.  He might as well have tried to stop Niagara.  No sooner were the flimsy barriers placed into position than the pressure of water flung then aside and the lowering of the lagoon went merrily onward.  The effort to stop the flow of water was given up at 6 o'clock last evening.</p>
                            <p>When questioned upon the subject Contractor Daley admitted that the outlet would have to be entirely rebuilt.  He said that when the leak was first discovered Superintendent Geraldine had proposed building a coffer dam around the outlet and thus keeping the water in the lagoon while repairs were being made.  This, however, had proved to be impractical both as to cost and results obtained.  The plan was therefore abandoned.  Superintendent Geraldine had also decided to move the intake to a point at the head of the outlet instead of the planking of the lagoon.</p>
                            <p>This manhole in the middle of the big basin has been an eyesore ever since it was constructed.  It stands where it is visible from all directions and with the lagoon full of water it is said that it will be a <choice><sic>constance</sic><corr>constant</corr></choice> menace to boats plying about, and accidents it is contended will certainly result if it is allowed to remain where <choice><sic>is</sic><corr>it</corr></choice> now is.</p>
                            <p>To locate the outlet in the middle of the basin necessitated the construction of over 175 feet of sewer, whereas the same result would have been attained if the outlet had been located at the edge of the basin where it could have been hidden from view and not be a dangerous obstruction for boats.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">GERALDINE GIVES HIS VIEWS.</head>
                            <p>In view of the situation, whether it is decided to remove the outlet to the edge of the basin, or not, it will be necessary to let all the water out of the lagoon before the break in the sewer can be repaired.  The idea of breaking into the sewer outside of the lagoon when the break was inside of the basin, will seriously interfere with the draining of the basin and will add very materially to the cost of making the repairs.  When the obstructions are removed from the hole made by Geraldine the water will pour out in a perfect torrent, and will wash a great hole in the surrounding made ground, which will afterward have to be filled.  Unless this is done the water will not all run out for several weeks, as it is now escaping at a rate which lowers the level in the big basin only about six inches per day.  At this rate cold weather would arrive before the lagoon could be filled again and great difficulty would follow any attempt to fill it during freezing weather, to say nothing of making the repairs during cold weather.</p>
                            <p>Nothing whatever was being done today to make any repairs, the hole made on the outside of the basin being filled with mud, through which the water was slowly escaping.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine and his men about the grounds are giving it out that the break was the work of malicious mischief, that some vandal opened the gate valve, allowing the water to escape, putting a sudden pressure on the pipe which caused it to settle.  This theory is <choice><sic>regared</sic><corr>regarded</corr></choice> as most absurd by people who have had experience with sewers, and they point to this as further proof of Geraldine's ignorance on that subject.  Proof is at hand that the gate valve was not opened and that it was found tightly closed after the break had been discovered.  There were two breaks inside the lagoon basin.  One was about midway between the edge of the basin and the manhole and the other was nearer the bank.  Both places were marked by miniature whirlpools and were plainly seen by a number of men about the grounds.</p>

                            <p>The members of the Illinois Exposition commission who remained in the city yesterday held a conference with the exposition executive committee at the Commercial club rooms yesterday to discuss the details of the rules governing exhibits and other matters on which the members of the Illinois body desired to be fully informed before returning to their constituents.</p>
                            <p>The Illinois commissioners present were President Carr, Secretary Hambleton and Commissioners Harper, Wall and Brinton.  All of the members of the exposition executive committee were present, together with President Wattles and Secretary Wakefield.</p>
                            <p>After lunch had been disposed of the subject matter of the meeting was discussed and the visitors took occasion to again express their pleasure at the manner in which they had been entertained while in Omaha, and their determination to make such a report to their constituents as would insure an

                            exhibit which would be at the same time a credit to the state of Illinois and a source of pleasure to the management of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>President Carr made a brief, but eloquent talk to this effect, but the sentiment of the visiting commission was more forcibly expressed by Secretary Hambleton, who referred in eloquent terms to the hospitality which had greeted the visitors at every turn.  He said he had noticed that even the gargoyles on the city hall smiled pleasantly upon him while he was walking about the streets examining the public buildings, and he said he was surprised to see that the giasticutises had champagne corks in their mouths.  Secretary Hambleton said these were simply symbols of the hospitality which was dispensed by Omaha, and he assured the exposition officials that the people of Illinois would know how to reciprocate the hearty good will shown toward their representatives.  He said it was his intention to go among all the manufacturers of Illinois within the next few months, and he promised that he would present the merits of the Omaha exposition to them in such a light that the state of Illinois would be represented by one of the finest exhibits ever seen at any exposition.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater informed the visitors that the Transmississippi Exposition would have, among other things, the largest and most complete exhibition of agricultural products and implements ever seen in the world, and this information was greeted with applause from the visitors, who declared that the large manufacturers of Illinois would be represented in that part of the exposition by an exhibit that would be second to none.</p>
                            <p>Along with these exchanges of pleasantries and compliments the party discussed the cold details of business and a perfect understanding was reached on all topics, the meeting breaking up amid assurances of hearty co-operation on both sides.</p>
                            <p>Just before this was done Manager Kirkendall withdrew with Judge Wall, the counsel for the Illinois commission, to execute the contract between the exposition association and the Illinois commission for the space to be occupied by the Illinois building.  The site allotted to this building was that selected while the whole party was on the grounds Wednesday and to which  reference has been made.</p>

                            <head type="sub">BIG TEPEE FOR THE EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Council Bluffs Building to Be a Novel and Striking Feature.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi Exposition association met at Council Bluffs last evening and spent an hour or two discussing matters connected with the interests it was forming to look after.  The meeting was quite largely attended, and a conclusion was reached upon one important matter that has been under discussion for a long time&#8212;the character of exhibit that is to be made at the exposition.  The scheme hit upon is strikingly original and novel, and if carried through will result in the erection of what will undoubtedly be one of the most attractive buildings on the grounds.</p>
                            <p>The association decided to build an immense wigwam and call it the Pottawattamie Wigwam.  The plan was suggested the special committee, consisting of Messrs. Bender, Moore, Haas, Binder, Maurer and Bixby, appointed at the last meeting to ascertain the cost, the ground rental and floor space in the main Horticultural building, and they came before the committee with architectural drawings showing the elevation and the floor plans of the proposed gigantic tepee.  The plans called for a circular conical building fifty feet in diameter on the ground and three stories high, the apex of the cone being nearly 100 feet high.  The rental of the ground and the cost of the building would be a little over $2,500.  The ground floor would contain available floor space exceeding 2,000 square feet, the second floor about 1,600, while the third floor would contain several hundred feet of additional floor area that could be used for practical purposes.  The frame of the building would be of timbers covered with planking and the outer covering would be a vulcanized cloth wound around from the bottom to the apex.  The windows are to be circular openings in imitation of Indian war shields, and the doors made to correspond to the primitive architecture of the original Pottawattamies.  The entire building is to be filled with the exhibits that will be made by the city and the county.  The form of the building makes its cost the lowest possible for any sort of structure, for all of the material, with the exception of the outer covering, can be used again, none of the dimension timbers being cut in the process of building.</p>
                            <p>The more the matter was discussed the more favorable the plan appeared, and the association paid but little attention to the other part of the special committee's report, which showed that 1,000 square feet of floor space in the main building could be secured for $1,000, and when the matter came to be voted upon every member present favored the erection of the big tepee.</p>
                            <p>Many of the members were in favor of making it seventy-five or even 100 feet in diameter and correspondingly higher, with the object of selling space to private exhibitors.  The idea was suggested by Mr. Wollman, who said he would give $100 for ten feet square on the ground floor.  Many other less definite proposals for space came from others present, and it became evident that the association could dispose of enough space to almost defray the cost of the ground and building.</p>
                            <p>Another suggestion was made that met <unclear/> erect the building so that it could be easily taken down, and it was thought that it could be sold to the park commissioners and moved into Fairmount park.  Its sides covered with galvanized iron would make it a permanent and valuable acquisition to the park.</p>
                            <p>A committee was appointed to confer with the architects of Council Bluffs and secure working plans, ascertain exactly what the cost of the structure would be and report at the next meeting, which will be held in the Grand hotel next Thursday night.</p>
                            <p>If the plan is carried out the building will be one of the most striking features on the exposition grounds.</p>

                            <p>Reports from California indicate that the northern portion of the state is beginning to awaken from its lethargic condition toward the Transmississippi Exposition and to realize that unless prompt action is taken the southern part of the state will have a monopoly of California exhibits and reap all the benefit to be derived from state exhibits.  The southern counties have been very active in making preparations for an extensive exhibit, while the counties in the northern part of the state have been inclined to stand back.  The tide has turned now, however, and northern people have commenced to bestir themselves.  The indications are now most favorable for representative exhibits from all portions of the state both by the counties themselves and by the state organizations.  The State Board of Trade has taken up the matter of making a display of the resources and industries of the state and the executive committee of the Miners' association is considering plans for making a general exhibit of the mineral resources which will do credit to the state.  Other state associations are taking similar action and the indications are now favorable for the whole state being on hand with exhibits which will be extensive and creditable.  The southern counties, alone, expect to occupy 60,000 square feet of space.  Elaborate plans for this exhibit have been in preparation for some time.</p>
                            <p>The Wisconsin Exposition commission has started active work in collecting subscriptions for the erection of a state building.  Circular letters have been sent out to all prominent people in the state, explaining the proposed plan by which the commonwealth of Wisconsin will be properly represented at the exposition and soliciting contributions according to the ability and inclination of the recipient.  It is stated that the erection and maintenance of the proposed state building will cost about 420,000, which it is proposed to raise by private contributions.</p>

                            <p>County Commissioner W. I. Kierstead has been appointed commissioner for the furniture section of the exposition and will leave Omaha for the east the first week in November to take up this work.  Mr. Kierstead has had extensive experience in the furniture business, having been actively engaged in that line for seventeen years with Dewey &amp; Stone of this city, one of the largest firms in the furniture line in this section.  A portion of the time Mr. Kierstead was with this firm he was the buyer and thus came into contact with all the prominent manufacturers of furniture.  His personal acquaintance with these large houses will be of great assistance to him in making arrangements with them for exhibiting at the exposition and will have a strong influence in causing them to make extensive exhibits.</p>

He was engaged all morning with the supervising architects, Walker &amp; Kimball, and said he was not prepared to make public the plan which will be followed in the work.</p>
                            <p>At a recent meeting of the Colorado Exposition commission it was decided that Colorado would require at least 12,000 feet of space for the display of its resources at the exposition.  It was reported to this meeting that the commissioners of Larimer county had appropriated money to pay for 400 feet of space for an agricultural exhibit by that county.</p>
                            <p>The report comes from Paris that Major Moses P. Handy, United States commissioner to the Paris exposition in 1900, will have an agent at the Transmississippi Exposition to select from among the best exhibits the material required by the government in making its exhibit at Paris.  Major Handy states that the quality and not quantity will be the absolute rule and that only the highest grade of exhibits will be considered.</p>
                            <p>The Chicago papers devote considerable space to accounts of the trip of the Illinois commission to Omaha this week.  The Record devotes two columns to the story of the first day, printing cuts of six of the main buildings.  The Inter Ocean has one and one-half columns and the Tribune two-thirds of a column of reading the matter descriptive of the grounds and the manner in which the party was taken care of.</p>

                            <p>James M. Greenwood, president of the association, and superintendent of the public schools of Kansas City; Albert G. Lane, chairman of the board of trustees, and also superintendent of the public schools of Chicago, and I. C. McNeill, treasurer of the association and also president of the State Normal school at West Superior, Minn., constituted the delegation which will examine into Omaha's facilities for caring for the great gathering which accompanies the meetings of the great association of school teachers and others interested in education.  The absent members of the executive committee are Secretary Shepherd, who sent

                            <p>These five men will pass upon the relative merits of the four cities which are competing most energetically for the honor of entertaining the educational association next year.  These four cities are Omaha, Washington, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles.  All of the committee except President Greenwood visited Washington recently, and some of the committee visited Salt Lake City and Los Angeles last year on a similar mission, those cities being active contestants at that time for the annual meeting.  For this reason the committee will not go any further west, but will meet at some central point, probably Chicago, within the next two or three weeks, as may be determined by the president, and will then pass <choice><sic>upen</sic><corr>upon</corr></choice> the question of location.

                            <p>The visitors were met at the railway station this morning by Superintendent Pearse and escorted to the Millard hotel.  From this point a start was made about 10 o'clock for a drive about the city.  President Dumont of the Commercial club, Manager W. N. Babcock of the Department of Transportation, representing the exposition; J. C. Hisey, superintendent of the public schools of Council Bluffs, and Commissioner J. E. Utt of the Commercial club accompanied the visitors.</p>
                            <p>The party visited the exposition grounds, where the visitors were shown the grounds and the buildings in course of erection.  From there the route led south on Twentieth street to the den of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben, where it is proposed to hold the meetings of the association.  Leaving this place the party drove about the city, visiting the city hall, The Bee building and other neighboring buildings, and the public parks.</p>
                            <p>At noon the party reached the Commercial club, where lunch was served and the facilities for providing for the entertainment of a large crowd of people, such as always attend the meetings of the association, were discussed at some length.  At 2 o'clock the members of the executive committee of the exposition met the visitors and the manner of entertaining the association was further discussed.  At 3 o'clock the local railway men, representing the lines entering Omaha, held a conference with the visiting committee and agreements regarding rates to be given at the time of the meeting of the association were made with as much definiteness as possible at this early day.</p>
                            <p>The visitors left town late this afternoon, the time until their departure being filled in pleasantly by the local committee.</p>

                            <p>The matter of the selection of a musical director for the exposition was discussed at the regular meeting of the exposition executive committee yesterday afternoon, but was laid over for future consideration on account of the difference of opinion among the members of the committee as to the advisability of making such appointment at this time.</p>
                            <p>For the first time in the history of the exposition a regular meeting of the executive committee was held in executive session, representatives of the newspapers being excluded from the meeting.  As soon as the meeting convened Mr. Reed moved that the committee go into executive session, and this was carried without discussion.  The doors were not opened for over three hours and then the members of the committee departed hurriedly for their respective places of business.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Missouri Pacific Likely to Have Trouble in Its Hands.</head>
                            <p>The serenity of local freight circles has been rudely perturbed by the question of freight rates on shipments of material from outside points into the grounds of the Transmississippi Exposition.  Railroads competitive with the Missouri Pacific from points east and south of here contend that shippers via that line are given a $4 advantage.  The Missouri Pacific refutes this statement, and in corroboration thereof points to a number of instances in which shippers who have requested the absorption of a $4 switching charge have been unceremoniously turned down.</p>
                            <p>The Missouri Pacific has the only tracks within the exposition grounds and this fact is at the bottom of the present agitation.  The Missouri Pacific maintains a switching charge of $2 for every car handled on its line up to the exposition grounds and $4 additional switching charge for handling the car within the grounds, making a total of $6 switching charges.  Of this $6 switching charge for every car handled to the exposition grounds, all the railroads, including the Missouri Pacific, today agreed to absorb $2, leaving the $4 to be paid by the consignee.</p>
                            <p>The matter came to a focus yesterday after noon when the general agent of an Omaha Chicago line wrote letters to each of the other railroads, asking what proportion of the $6 switching charge it would absorb.  Inquiry among all the lines this morning disclosed the fact that they will absorb $2, leaving $4 for the shipper to pay.  The disturbing element in the situation is the anxiety of each railroad to discover whether any of its competitors is <choice><sic>obsorbing</sic><corr>absorbing</corr></choice> any more than $2 of the switching charge.  Assistant General Freight Agent Phillippi of the Missouri Pacific this morning declared that if he found any of the other lines were absorbing more than $2 he would proceed to absorb the whole $6 switching charge.</p>
                            <p>Despite the written statements sent out this morning by each line to the effect that it would absorb only $2 there is a general feeling of suspicion that some of the lines are absorbing more of the switching charge than this amount.</p>
                            <p>An agent of a line competing with the Missouri Pacific this morning said: "This $6 switching charge is altogether too high.  It is the same amount the Missouri Pacific charges for switching a car clear out to Portal on its line.  It gives that road a great big advantage on all shipments into the grounds from the south and the east.  If any one road is to have any advantage in this matter, it certainly should be one of the railroads that has contributed something to the exposition."</p>

                            <head type="sub">BREAK IN THE EXPOSITION SEWER.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Cause of the Leak is at Last Located.</head>
                            <p>The cause of the break in the lagoon has been found and it is now settled that the twelve-ton roller used by the grading contractor to compact the bottom of the lagoon is directly chargeable with the leak.</p>
                            <p>John F. Daley, who superintended the construction of the sewer as an inspector of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, had a force of men at work this morning, uncovering the pipe inside the lagoon, the water in the big basin having all run out during yesterday and last night.  When the fifteen or eighteen inches of closely compacted clay and gumbo was removed from the <choice><sic>sewyer</sic><corr>sewer</corr></choice> trench and the pipe uncovered, it was seen that two joints had given way very slightly, but sufficiently to crack the cement in the joints and make a way for the escape of the water from the bottom of the lake into the sewer.</p>
                            <p>In looking for the cause of this condition it was found that the two disturbed joints were directly in the track of the heavy roller which had passed over the sewer at this point.  The track of the roller was plainly visible in the bottom of the basin, leaving no doubt as to the cause of the trouble, and Mr. Daley was greatly <choice><sic>releived</sic><corr>relieved</corr></choice> to find that the proof was at hand that the fault was not caused by poor workmanship.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Daley has been a resident of Omaha for the past twenty years and has built many Omaha sewers.  It is said that he is highly commended by the present city engineer as a contractor, whose work may be depended upon, and is regarded among city officials and others coming in contact with his work as thoroughly reliable and competent contractor.  He felt aggrieved that any suspicion should have rested on him in connection with this particular sewer, and said he had taken especial pains to see that the work was most carefully done.</p>
                            <p>The manhole which stood in the center of the basin has been razed to the ground, and the overflow pipe and valve for draining the lagoon will be located at the edge of the bank where it will be out of sight.  This work will be done at once, and the lagoon will be filled before freezing weather.</p>
                            <p>It has been determined that the lake shall be kept full by means of an eight-inch pipe, which will be placed in the bottom of the lagoon just east of the island at Twentieth street.  The twenty-inch main in Twentieth street is being laid under difficulty, owing to the presence of water from the artesian well, but the work is well along.  The pipe for supplying the lagoon will extend east from the middle of the island, and will form a fountain throwing out an immense quantity of water which will fill the canal and basin in short order.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DESIGN FOR THE EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Plans of the Colonnades that Will Connect the Main Buildings and Bridges that Will Span the Lagoon.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The supervising architects of the exposition are bending all their energies to the work of turning out the drawings for the embellishment of the main court, designing the viaducts across the canal, planning the colonnades which are to surround the lagoon and afford a covered passageway entirely around the main court, providing for the beautifying of the spaces between the main buildings, and in short, doing the thousand-and-one things that must be looked after before the entire plan of the main court is complete.  This work is rapidly approaching completion and within a short time the multitude of detail plans will have been finished and ready for the contractors.</p>
                            <p>The drawings are finished for the elaborate and artistic colonnade and viaduct which will grace the east end of the main court and afford a means of reaching the bluff tract by crossing Sherman avenue.  This viaduct and its accompanying structures will form a most artistic finish to the magnificent setting of the Court of Honor, being in perfect harmony with the magnificent design of the main buildings.</p>
                            <p>In the center, spanning the open space now appearing between the high embankments at the east end of the Kountze tract, will be a tower of light and airy architecture, the lower part being in the form of an arch, through which entrance may be and to the viaduct.  On either side of this central tower will be a colonnade.  Each of these will be in the form of a double curve, being on the same level as the tower and viaduct and forming a promenade from which the view of the Court of Honor will appear to the very best advantage.  On the inside of these wide circles will be circular stairways, one on each side of the center, by means of which the level of the viaduct may be reached.</p>
                            </div3>

                            These are being designed by the supervising architects and will appear as component parts of the viaduct.  Their architecture will be in keeping with the main buildings of the exposition and they will be beautiful structures.  Preliminary sketches have already been made, and these show buildings designed for convenience as well as for architectural effect.  They will be modern in all particulars, so far as the useful features are concerned, and will afford a delightful resting place.</p>
                            <p>The temporary bridges which will cross the lagoon half way between Twentieth street and the east end and at a point near the Mirror have been designed, and the drawings for the permanent iron bridge across the lagoon at Twentieth street are rapidly nearing completion.  These latter bridges will each be fifty feet in width and will extend from the bank of the canal to the island in the center.</p>
                            <p>The colonnade around the Mirror and those on either side of the Administration building have been designed and the working drawings are finished.  The drawings for the coping and railing about the lagoon and the stairways at the east end have been finished and the force in the architects' office is now engaged in planning the arrangement of the small parks and pergolas between the main buildings east of Twentieth street.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Walker, one of the supervising architects, is now engaged in laying out the color scheme for the Court of Honor and determining upon the details of the plan which is to make the Transmississippi and International Exposition different from all former expositions held in this country.  The main buildings will be decorated in colors which will make one harmonious whole and add greatly to the artistic effect of the main court.</p>

                            <p>The live stock men have a number of associations which always meet at the same place and at about the same time, arranging their sessions so as to not conflict, and Mr. Dinsmore's idea is to capture the entire lot of associations thirteen in all.  The first meeting will occur Wednesday of this week and the last of the lot will meet Thursday of next week.  The full list of these associations is as follows: Western Holstein-Freisian Cattle Breeders' association, American Shetland Pony club, Red Polled Cattle Club of America, American Clydesdale association, American Shire Horse Breeders' association, American Cotswold Sheep Breeders' association, American Shropshire Breeders' association, American Aberdeen Angus Breeders' association, American Short Horn Breeders' association, American Hereford Cattle Breeders' association, American Hampshire Sheep Breeders' association, Victoria Swine Breeders' association.</p>

                            <p>The Photo-Chrome company of Detroit has applied for 200 feet of space for an exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The Paraffine Dust Oil Works of Nashville, Tenn., has applied for 200 feet for an exhibit of floor stains, etc.</p>
                            <p>Dudley Smith, commissioner general to Great Britain, has arrived in New York, and writes from there that he will be in Omaha the first of next week.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Buildings and Grounds has removed its headquarters to the exposition grounds and will be forced in the white cottage on the bluff tract opposite Lothrop street.</p>
                            <p>The Tennessee Marble company of Knoxville has tendered to the Department of Exhibits as a gift the extensive exhibit of Tennessee marbles which this firm has on exhibition at the Nashville exposition.</p>
                            <p>A. F. Turpin of London, a wax figure artist, is in the city in consultation with A. E. Felder, concessionaire of the Moorish palace, regarding certain details of the interior arrangement of this feature of the Plaisance.</p>

                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission will hold a regular meeting at its headquarters tomorrow evening.  There is a considerable amount of routine business to be transacted, but no business of great importance to come before the commission.</p>
                            <p>Commercial Agent J. D. Montague of New Mexico has forwarded the application of Milton C. Nettleton for 100 feet of space for an exhibition of Mexican gems and of S.

                            <p>The Treasury department has granted to Wong Chin Foo, the Chinese commissioner for the Transmississippi Exposition, permission to import 250 of his countrymen into the United States by way of Seattle, the collector for the Puget Sound district <choice><sic>haveing</sic><corr>having</corr></choice> been instructed to admit 250 people from China and issue certificates entitling them to remain in this country during the exposition.  Foo is instructed to furnish the collector with a copy of his concession contract and with a list of the people he wants admitted.</p>
                            <p>Wong Chin Foo is the Chinese commissioner and has nothing to do with the concession for the Chinese village, for which Hong Sling has the contract.  Foo's purpose is to have a working exhibition of all lines of Chinese manufacturing industries.  For this purpose he will bring to Omaha artisans and artists from the north of China and will erect a Chinese pagoda on the exposition grounds, in which will be installed the busy people, who will turn out genuine articles of Chinese manufacture in the same manner as the work is done in the orient.  Several weeks ago he sent an agent to China to organize the company of mechanics and artists which will be required.  This agent was instructed to secure competent people in all the lines of manufacture and art pursued in China, and also to procure the necessary paraphernalia to properly equip the pagoda.</p>
                            <p>Foo is president of the Chinese Equal Rights league, an organization having for one of its objects the removal of the prejudice existing in this country against all natives of China.  The contention of this league is that this prejudice has arisen out of the fact that the great bulk of Chinese immigrants are coolies of the very lowest type from southern China.  Members of the league claim that the objection to Chinese would never have arisen if the coolies had been excluded and the immigration confined to people from north China.  They contend that the people of north China are entirely <choice><sic>differen</sic><corr>different</corr></choice> in many respects from the coolies and would be a desirable class of immigrants.</p>

                            <p>The sewer which is to drain the lagoon in the main court of the exposition grounds is again in working order and the water was turned into the lagoon this morning.  The valve which is to be opened when it is desired to drain the lagoon has been placed back of the line of sheet piling, but the drain pipe extends to the place where the tall manhole formerly stood, in the middle of the basin.  The outer end of this pipe has been covered with a stout netting of heavy wire to keep out debris and will only come into play when it is desired to draw out all the water.  The overflow pipe will be placed at the edge of the basin and will enter the sewer beyond the valve.  It will be almost entirely out of sight and the broad surface of the Mirror will be unbroken by any obstructions.</p>
                            <p>The artisan well and the 2-inch pipes which were used to fill the lagoon in the first place constitute the only source of water supply, and some time will necessarily elapse before the lagoon is filled to the top of the banks.</p>
                            <p>The work of laying the water mains on the grounds is progressing and the work will be completed within the next two weeks, but the date when the connections will be made with the mains of the water company is unsettled.  Until this connection is made the amount which can be <unclear/>ed into the lagoon is very small and the <unclear/>g process will be very slow.</p>

                            <p>"I believe the exposition at Omaha will present the very finest and most complete display of agricultural products ever seen in this country.  I know that is saying a good deal, for it is the first impulse of every one who hears such a statement to raise the World's fair question.  I believe it, though, and make no exceptions.</p>
                            <p>"The gentlemen who have undertaken to build that exposition are alert, wide-awake business men.  They have planned a big thing and they have already pushed the preliminary work so far that there is no doubt as to the success of the exposition.  The main buildings are already far on the road to completion.  There is no doubt the exposition will be absolutely complete on the date set for the opening&#8212;June 1, 1898.  The people of Illinois and Chicago owe it to themselves to do all in their power to promote the success of the enterprise."</p>

                            <p>At a recent meeting of the Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles it was reported that a large portion of the $7,000 required to make a country exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition had been raised and the arrangements for the exhibit were reported to be well under way.</p>

He states that the main products of the country are mother of pearl and sandal wood, and he makes inquiry regarding the conditions governing exhibits, etc.</p>
                            <p>Art Director A. H. Griffiths has notified the Department of Exhibits that has has secured the famous painting by W. C. Norton of London, entitled "Moonlight," and another by Fred B. Williams of New York entitled, "Pastoral."  Mr. Griffiths also writes that he has been promised by the Chicago Art Institute the load of four or five of the best works of art in that collection for exhibition at Omaha and that the Scribner Publishing company will send the large collection of water colors by F. Hopkinson Smith.</p>
                            <p>The passenger department of the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul road has requested to supply it with several hundred illustrated pamphlets of the exposition, which it intends to distribute among its traveling passenger agents, so that they may be thoroughly posted regarding the exposition and may be able to distribute the circulars where they will do the most good.  A large bunch of printed matter was sent to the Chicago office by department.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Assert the Contractors Are Not Living Up to Union Rules and Take This Way of Proving It.</head>
                            <p>A strike is on again at the exposition grounds.  This time it is the carpenters working for Goldie &amp; Sons.  Thirty-six of them walked out at noon today.  The trouble is due to the refusal of the contractors to conform to the rules of organized labor.  When the strike was on before these contractors promised that when other contractors adopted these rules that they would fall in.  Strehlow accepted the terms of the union and the carpenters supposed Goldie &amp; Sons would also do the same.  They have waited till the present time without securing that concession from the contractors and the walkout this noon was the result.</p>
                            <p>It is said that Goldie &amp; Sons now take the position that the union should discipline the Omaha contractors first.  That refers to Hamilton Bros. and Parish.  The former are only working a few men at present, as their material is not all here, and Parrish has not yet begun work on his contract.  The union men say that Hamilton Bros. have given it out that they will not adopt the union rules and that they will make the fight to the finish.  As Goldie &amp; Sons seem to stand behind these contractors in their position not to give in till the Omaha men set the example, the carpenters concluded that the contest might as well be resumed now as later and the strike was ordered.  Only three men went to work <unclear/></p>

Commissioners Poynter, Dutton and Boydston constituted this committee and it was almost 12 o'clock when they adjourned and laid the report before the commission.  As a majority of the commission took part in the preparation of this report it is more than probable that it will be adopted when it comes up for consideration by the commission.</p>
                            <p>This report provides for the expending of $68,660.25 of the $100,000 appropriated by the state.  The amount is itemized as follows:</p>

                            <p>The consideration of this report was not taken up at the morning session, but the commission listened to the representatives of the educational interests of the state, who made statements showing the consideration which should be given to having a representative exhibit of the schools of the state.  State Superintendent Jackson, Chancellor MacLean and Prof. Barbour of the Nebraska State university addressed the commission on these three matters.  Superintendent Jackson asked that at least 5,000 feet of floor space be secured for the display of the work of the schools of the state and he produced a large array of figures and statistics to show that this amount would be very meager for showing the work of the schools of the state.</p>
                            <p>Chancellor MacLean asked the board to secure 2,000 feet for the use of the university for making a display and supported this application by arguments showing the importance of making a good showing of the educational facilities and advancements of the state.</p>
                            <p>No action was taken on these requests, both of them being laid over for future consideration.</p>
                            <p>A committee of the commission was appointed to confer with the executive committee of the exposition regarding certain terms and conditions in the contract for space in the Nebraska building which had been presented to the commission for approval.</p>
                            <p>The commission will conclude its labors today.</p>

                            <p>Edward Fitch Bishop of Denver, a member of the Colorado commission, is in the city, consulting with the Department of Exhibits regarding the regulations governing exhibitors at the exposition and securing full information for the guidance of the Colorado commission in making arrangements for the Colorado exhibit at the exposition.  The Colorado commission will meet in Denver November 9, when final details will be agreed upon regarding the amount of space which will be required for the Colorado exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bishop is quite enthusiastic regarding the part Colorado will take in the exposition and says that the exhibit from the Centennial state will be extensive in several lines.  He brings the application of Prof. Alston Ellis, president of the State Agricultural college at Fort Collins, Colo., for 1,000 feet of space for an exhibit which Prof. Ellis promises will excel the excellent display made at the World's fair.</p>
                            <p>The Colorado commissioner also states that Mrs. M. A. Shute, secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, has invented a device whereby the fruits of the state, instead of being preserved in a liquid will be shown in their natural state, being kept in a refrigerator box of new design which preserved them perfectly.  In this way it is expected that the mammoth strawberries for which Colorado is becoming famous will be displayed in their luscious freshness.</p>
                            <p>The Colorado Horticultural society will meet in Denver, November 19 at which time arrangements will be made for the exhibit to be made by the society.</p>

Mr. Peabody also asks if arrangements could be made for the purpose of allowing the exhibition of a sponge schooner with all the appliances for sponge fishing and for an exhibit of marine curiosities.</p>
                            <p>President Fordyce of the Cotton Belt railway has written to the Department of Exhibits, stating that he has decided to make an exhibit at the exposition of the agricultural products from the lands along the line of railway with which he is connected.

                            <head type="sub">General Preston Explains How an Early Decision Will Help the Work of His Department to a Great Extent.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, Oct. 26.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;General Preston, director of the mint, is especially anxious that the Transmississippi and International Exposition association shall indicate to the department a design for the medal which is provided by congress to be presented to exhibitors.  General Preston is desirous of giving the exposition a medal typical of the country and industries represented, and is also moved to request the design for the medalette which shall be struck during the period of the exposition.  Speaking of this feature of the show in Omaha next year General Preston said: "We are still manufacturing medals for prize winners at the World's fair, due in a great part to the failure of the directory of the Chicago exposition to adopt a design for the medal until nearly the close of the exposition.  It requires considerable time for the engravers to properly prepare a medal, and in order to avoid delays I would most earnestly urge upon the people having the Omaha Exposition in charge a measure of speed of submitting their ideas as to what the medal should contain.  I believe in the typical character of medal.  Should the matter be submitted to the bureau here for design it would naturally take a national character, which to my mind is not what is wanted by the Omaha people.  I would have it so arranged that the medals during the last month of the exposition, thereby saving an endless amount of worry and heartburning at the same time."</p>

                            <p>The case of the Western Bank Note and Engraving company of Chicago against Dion Geraldine, a case to collect a judgment recovered in a Chicago court against Geraldine for $99.65, was called in Justice Foster's court yesterday, that being the date set for Joseph Hayden to appear and show the consideration which passed between himself and Geraldine for the assignments of salary given him by Geraldine March 12, or twelve days after Geraldine was employed by the exposition.  These assignments were two in number, one being for $5,000 and the other for $1,730.50, both being dated March 12, 1897, being Geraldine's salary up to and including July 14, 1898, at the rate of $500 per month.</p>
                            <p>When a garnishment process was issued against the exposition management to appear and show cause why it should not pay the Chicago judgment out of the salary due Geraldine, Secretary Wakefield produced these assignments and testified that Geraldine had been paid but one month's salary, the subsequent payments being made to Joseph Hayden in accordance with the order of Geraldine attached to the assignments.</p>
                            <p>Upon this showing an order was issued directing Joseph Hayden to appear and show what consideration passed in return for the assignments.  Before the hour set for the hearing Mr. Hayden appeared in person at the office of Justice Foster and presented a written statement in the nature of an affidavit, setting forth the circumstances under which he alleged the deal had been made.

                            <p>The total of the alleged loans and credits, including the item of $1,000 for an indemnifying bond, is $7,316.83.  The total of the two assignments is $6,730.50, so that according to the statement of Mr. Hayden, Geraldine is ahead of him just $586.33.  Mr. Hayden furnished a bind in the sum of $1,000 for Geraldine in the case commenced in the district court by Marsh &amp; Brigham, other Chicago creditors of Geraldine, to recover on a judgment obtained in the Chicago courts.  In this case Geraldine set up the defense that he was a citizen of Omaha, and that the exposition was exempt from garnishment on his account for that reason.  The bonds was given to protect the plaintiffs pending the settlement of the case.  It is stated by well posted attorneys that the bond is released, under the circumstances, and if this is true the $1,000 is not properly chargeable in the account of Mr. Hayden.</p>

                            <p>When the statement was filed by Mr. Hayden he stated that it would not be convenient for him to appear in court; he then requested that the case be continued to some future date.</p>
                            <p>Attorney DeBord consented that the case should be continued until October 29 and an entry was made on the docket to this effect.</p>
                            <p>About the same time another case in which Geraldine is defendant was on trial in the municipal court.  This was the case of the Toby Furniture company of Chicago, a suit to recover $85.25 for furniture purchased by Geraldine in February, 1895.  An order had been made for the exposition officials to appear and show cause why they should not be ordered to pay the judgment which had been entered in the municipal court against Geraldine made his affidavit about W. H. Tamm, swearing that Tamm was in Europe and that his testimony was highly important to the defendant and asking that the case be continued until Tamm could be reached in Europe or until he should return to this country.  When the case came to trial Tamm was working on the exposition grounds, but instead of putting him on the witness stand to refute the damaging affidavits filed by the plaintiff Geraldine offered no defense whatever, and judgment was rendered against him by default.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield answered the summons by producing the assignments of salary given by Geraldine to Joseph Hayden, covering all the salary which will be due Geraldine until July 14, 1898, providing he remains with the exposition until that time.  Secretary Wakefield's testimony was the same as he gave at the hearing in Justice Foster's court October 16, in the case of the Western Bank Note and Engraving company against Geraldine, showing that Geraldine had been personally paid but one month's salary, the other payments being made by check to Joseph Hayden.</p>
                            <p>Attorney W. A. Saunders, who represented the Toby Furniture company, inquired particularly how the checks were endorsed when they were returned, asking if the endorsements showed that Geraldine had drawn the money.  Mr. Wakefield could not remember about this matter and an order was made requiring him to produce these checks in court.  He was also ordered to hold $150 of the money due Geraldine and an order was issued requiring Joseph Hayden to appear and show cause why he should not allow the judgment of the Toby Furniture company to be paid by the exposition out of the money due Geraldine.  All of these orders were made returnable Saturday of this week, when a further hearing will be had.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Workmen Demand Union Wages and the Contractor Refuses to Pay the Scale&#8212;No Trouble on Other Buildings.</head>
                            <p>The strike on the Mines building at the exposition grounds was in evidence this morning, the huge skeleton being entirely deserted.  Not a man was at work on the building and a committee of six men from the Carpenters' union was on watch near the east end of the building to see that no men went to work.  Mr. Goldie said he would not make any move until Monday.  He said that at that time he would put on a full force of men and would pay the same prices and work the same hours as heretofore.</p>
                            <p>In reply to a question Mr. Goldie said he would not give in to the union, but would continue to pursue the same policy as before, being governed by the actions of Hamilton Bros., and W. H. Parrish, who had told him they would not give in to the unions.</p>
                            <p>The strike appeared to have had no effect upon the Machinery building, a full force of men being at work this morning.  Mr. Hamilton said the men had said that they had no complaint to make and did not intend to leave their jobs.  He said he would not yield to the unions, but would put on men as fast as they could be handled to advantage.  The raising of the south wall of the building was commenced this morning and Mr. Hamilton said he would be able to handle more men within the next day or two.</p>
                            <p>The Manufactures building was not affected by the strike, Contractor Strehlow having yielded to the demands of the union several days ago.</p>
                            <p>The Agriculture building, for which Goldie has the contract, is delayed by the non-arrival of piles and the strike has very little effect upon it.  Half a dozen men were at work cutting off the tops of the piles which had been driven.  Mr. Goldie said this building would be pushed as soon as the delayed piles arrived and a full force of non-union men would be employed.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Formally Recognized by the Exposition Managers.</head>
                            <p>The contest which has been waged since the inception of the Transmississippi and International Exposition to secure the recognition by the exposition management of the rules prescribed by organized labor for the regulation of the wages and hours of workingmen, terminated yesterday in a complete victory for the labor unions and a concession by the exposition management of the points which has been contended for from the beginning.  In the future eight hours will constitute a day's work on the exposition grounds, and the scale of wages fixed by the respective labor unions will form the basis on which skilled laborers will be paid.  This does not recognize the labor unions nor does the action of the exposition management preclude the employment of men not members of labor organizations, but this was not demanded by the labor representatives as they say this phase of the matter will adjust itself.</p>
                            <p>This action was taken by the executive committee of the exposition at a special meeting at the Commercial club yesterday afternoon.  Soon after the committee convened the doors were closed and the committee went into executive session.  It was three hours before the doors opened and the announcement was made that the following resolution had been introduced by Manager Rosewater and adopted without a dissenting vote:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That from and after this date all contracts for construction which shall be awarded by the exposition shall provide that the union scale of wages in force October1, 1897, shall govern in the payment for skilled labor, and that eight hours shall constitute one day;s work, providing that extra shifts may be used without overtime charge.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That for all skilled labor employed directly by the exposition the union scale of wages and eight-hour day, as provided above, shall prevail.</p>
                            <p>It was also announced that a special meeting of the board of directors of the exposition had been called for 4 o'clock this afternoon to ratify this action of the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Neville and Secretary Casper of the Nebraska Executive Commission were in consultation with the executive committee during a brief portion of the executive session regarding the contract for space for the Nebraska building.  Their objections to certain clauses in the contract as drawn were referred to Manager Kirkendall, and an agreement was reached after the meeting had adjourned.</p>
                            <p>Manager Reed was authorized to enter into a contract with A. F. Turpin for a concession for a cyclorama representing a famous battle, the affair to occupy a space of 150 feet square.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater presented a communication from Walter W. Pollack, secretary of the Wisconsin Exposition Commission, regarding a proposed trip to Omaha by the Wisconsin commission to confer with the exposition management regarding the exhibit to be made by Wisconsin and the state building to be erected by the Badger state, and also to select a site for this building.  The matter was left with Managers Rosewater and Babcock to make the necessary arrangements.</p>

                            <p>All of the 350 teachers in the Omaha schools have subscribed their names to the constitution and by-laws of the National Educational association and henceforth they will industriously labor to secure the next meeting of the organization in this city for exposition year.  The matter was brought to the attention of the teachers some time ago, and yesterday afternoon the last of the teachers signed and paid in the required fee to Superintendent Pearse.</p>
                            <p>Omaha teachers are not the only ones who are working for Omaha for the next meeting place of the National Educational association.  The teachers out in the state are talking the matter up and are rapidly enrolling their names and pledging their support.  Yesterday Superintendent Pearse received a letter from Superintendent Stevens of the public schools of Fairbury, in which that gentleman stated that the sixteen teachers there had joined the association, and that they were prepared to labor unceasingly for Omaha.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Two Fraudulent Checks Drawn on an Omaha Bank Make Their Appearance in This City.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>By the misuse of letters of introduction to prominent business and professional men of St. Louis from a number of prominent citizens of Omaha, William Elliot, commercial agent of the Transmississippi and International Exposition for the state of Missouri, has succeeded in realizing $500 on two bogus checks drawn on the National Bank of Commerce of this city and cashed in St. Louis on Tuesday.</p>
                            <p>The first of the bogus checks to be returned to this city made its appearance yesterday morning.  It was in the mail from St. Louis to the National Bank of Commerce of this city.  It was a regular check of the local bank, taken from one of its check books, and was drawn to the order of William Elliot, and bore the signature of "Edward E. Bruce."  It came from the Exchange National bank of St. Louis.  Its arrival created consternation at the National Bank of Commerce here, as it bore all the earmarks of a forgery.</p>
                            <p>When the suspicions that the exposition's representative in the state of Missouri was using his position to fleece the good people of St. Louis were confirmed there was amazement and indignation in exposition circles.  When the excitement was nearly at its height it was intensified by the appearance of a second forged check, payable to William Elliot, and fraudulently signed "Edward E. Bruce."  This was from the Boatman's National bank of St. Louis, and, like its predecessor, was for the amount of $250.  It had been taken from a check book of the National Bank of Commerce of this city.  As the two checks that have been returned to the local bank for payment are numbered "64" and "66" respectively, it is feared by John H. Evans, president of the National Bank of Commerce, and others, that more than two bogus checks have been cashed, and it would occasion no surprise if a whole batch of the fraudulent papers showed up here soon.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">NOTIFIES EXPOSITION OFFICIALS.</head>
                            <p>As soon as the first of the checks came to the notice of President Evans of the National Bank of Commerce he went before the exposition's executive committee, which was then in session, and laid the matter before Mr. Bruce and others.  At the suggestion of Secretary Wakefield the banks of St. Louis were immediately telegraphed that the checks were forgeries, that Elliot carried no deposits in any Omaha bank, and that he had no authority whatever to use the name of E. E. Bruce.  This action will effectually prevent the banks of St. Louis cashing any more of the checks, but how many they cashed up to date can only be surmised.</p>
                            <p>The game of Elliot was a smooth one, and if he succeeds in making his escape it will prove to have been well played.  He came to Omaha a few weeks ago armed with the very best credentials.  He represented that he came directly to this city from Australia, and produced letters of introduction from persons of good standing in Australia and Paris.  He made application for one of the commercial agencies of the Transmississippi Exposition, a position which calls for the securing of suitable exhibits for the exposition and the compensation of which is based on percentages.  He was given the commercial agency for the state of Missouri.  He went to St. Louis with letters of introduction to the mayor, prominent firms and newspapers.  The letters were from Mayor Frank E. Moores, Edward Rosewater, E. E. Bruce, John A. Wakefield and G. M. Hitchcock of this city.  It was believed that he was doing great work in booming the exposition in the metropolis of Missouri, as newspapers received from there showed that he had been quite successful in obtaining elaborate reading notices advertising the Omaha exposition.</p>
                            <p>The letters of introduction which he carried with him evidently enabled Elliot to work some St. Louis firms for money on checks that were not worth the paper on which they were written.  Just how he worked the game among the St. Louis people is not definitely known.  Details of his artful manipulations will probably be received today, but it is believed by Mr. Bruce, Mr. Evans and others that he succeeded in convincing a number of reliable St. Louis firms that he had authority to draw on the account of Mr. Bruce, manager of the department of the exposition in which he was employed, and use checks signed by Mr. Bruce and payable to Elliot.  A peculiar fact in his transactions is that he should have used the name "Edward E. Bruce" for the signature on the checks.  That is not the manner in which Mr. Bruce signs his name, as he always subscribes himself, "E. E. Bruce."  Mr. Bruce last night expressed himself surprised that Elliot did not forge the name of Mr. Wakefield, as he is the secretary of the exposition, but his use of Mr. Bruce's name is doubtless due to the fact that the name is shorter and the signature a plainer one.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">HE TOLD A NICE STORY.</head>
                            <p>Before going to St. Louis Elliot stopped in at the National Bank of Commerce here to say that $500 would be received by the bank within forty-eight hours from the Chemical National bank of New York.  He said he was going to St. Louis, and asked that the sum just be placed to his credit in the local bank.  Incidentally he asked for a blank check book of the bank.  His signature was requested and he placed it in the book provided for that purpose without hesitation.  He was given the desired check book and left with the assurance that the $500 from the New York bank would soon be received.  Up to date no tidings of that $500 have been heard hereabouts.</p>
                            <p>Of course should the $500 turn up from New York it will exactly cover the two checks for $2250 each that so unexpectedly made their appearance here yesterday.  But even the receipt of the $500 from the Chemical National bank of New York, and the cancellation of the indebtedness, will not explain away the fact that Elliot forged the signature of Edward E. Bruce to at least two checks.</p>
                            <p>On the margin of the two checks received yesterday was written "Expense account, Missouri,"  evidently indicating to the person who cashed them that Elliot had a very liberal expense account and could draw on the exposition at will.  As a matter of fact, he not only had no such privilege but was guaranteed no regular salary.  He was working on a commission basis, as are about eighty other representatives of the Department of Exhibits, and even were the checks made good his transactions would be unwarranted.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">HAD PLEASING ADDRESS.</head>
                            <p>Elliot is described as a man of exceedingly good appearance.  He dressed well, was an interesting talker and was altogether suave.  Though hailing from Australia according to his own statements he had much the manner and address of a southern gentleman.  He made a good impression upon the few Omaha people who met him and they all supposed that the exposition had secured a thoroughly trustworthy and highly creditable representative.  He was not in Omaha very long, starting out to work in his field within a short time after receiving his appointment.  Mr. Bruce, the head of the Department of Exhibits, says that he saw Elliot only for a few minutes one day and was impressed with him.</p>
                            <p>The greatest regret is manifested that a representative of the exposition should have proved crooked, but it is believed that in the employment of so large a number of men who merely work for commissions that the character of all cannot be fully known.  It is not believed that the interests of the exposition in St. Louis will suffer by the transactions of one criminal representative.</p>
                            <p>At noon today John H. Evans, president of the National Bank of Commerce of this city, said that no more of the bogus checks to which Elliot had forged the name of Edward E. Bruce had been received here.  Only the two checks mentioned in

                            this morning's issue of The Bee have passed through the Omaha clearing house up to date.  President Evans is not of the opinion that no more of the checks will show up.  Had Elliot succeeded in passing any more than two of the checks previous to the discovery of his crookedness here yesterday they would have undoubtedly been received before noon today by the Omaha clearing house.</p>

                            <p>The labor resolutions which the exposition executive committee has decided to recommend to the exposition directory this afternoon were endorsed last night at a special joint meeting by the Central Labor union and the Building Trades council.  The action taken was unanimous and harmonious, although considerable discussion followed the introduction of the resolutions, and a few minor changes were incorporated in them.</p>
                            <p>There was a goodly attendance of the delegates of the two bodies at the meeting.  President Schrack of the trades council was elected chairman, and J. W. Kinney secretary.  The resolutions were presented by President Bell of the Central Labor union, who was one of the committee which considered the labor matter with the members of the executive committee of the exposition company.</p>
                            <p>The matter of the exposition bond proposition coming up at the election was not considered at all.  This will be the topic of a mass meeting of organized and unorganized labor that is to be held in Labor temple tonight.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Buildings and Grounds has completed the change of quarters and the offices of the department are now established in the white cottage on the bluff tract.  The Department of Transportation will occupy the rooms just vacated by the Department of Buildings and Grounds.</p>
                            <p>Commercial Agent Hodgin, who is now in Ohio, has sent to the Department of Exhibits the application of the Cleveland Faucet company for 208 feet of space for an exhibit of carbolic acid gas apparatus and beer pumps.  Mr. Hodgin also states that the Cleveland Chamber of Commerce is preparing to make a collective exhibit occupying 3,000 feet.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Transportation has received notice from the Transmissouri Freight association to the effect that all lines in the association to the effect that all lines in the association to the effect that all lines in the association will return exhibits from the exposition free of charge after the exposition is over, provided the goods have not changed hands.  The Transmissouri association covers all lines west of the Missouri to the Pacific coast.</p>
                            <p>The list of conventions which will be held in Omaha during 1898 continues to grow.  The latest addition is the American Association of Farmers' Institute Managers which was secured by Prof. F. W. Taylor, who telegraphed the Department of Exhibits from Columbus, O., that the association had decided to meet in Omaha next year.  He is the secretary of the association, which is composed of the managers of the farmers' institutes attached to the several state universities in various parts of the country.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">NO POLITICS IN THE EXPOSITION.</hi></head>
                            <p>The following announcement, which appears on the front page of the World-Herald in double-column under glaring headlines, is an attempt to turn the exposition into a political machine:</p>
                            <p>The trouble between the management of the exposition and organized labor was put well into the way of settlement yesterday afternoon by the action of the executive committee.  The committee unanimously adopted the following resolutions, recommended by the committee, consisting of G. M. Hitchcock, Thomas Hoctor and C. S. Montgomery:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That from and after this date all contracts for construction which shall be awarded by the exposition shall provide that the union scale of wages in force October 1, 1897, shall govern in the payment of skilled labor and that eight hours shall constitute one day's work, providing that extra shifts of eight hours may be used without overtime charge.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That for all skilled labor employed directly by the exposition the union scale of wages and eight-hour day, as provided above, shall prevail.</p>
                            <p>This statement is misleading and designed for effect upon the labor vote.  The resolutions adopted by the exposition executive committee were not recommended by the Hitchcock-Hoctor committee.  That committee submitted a contract with the labor unions which had a string to it that would have made the contract void and would, if carried into effect, have thrown a cloud upon the legality of the exposition bonds.  The executive committee therefore declined to adopt the recommendations of the Hitchcock-Hoctor committee and in their place adopted the resolutions drawn and offered by Manager Rosewater.  Thomas Hoctor was not present at the session of the executive committee and has no claim upon the gratitude of organized labor for what was done.</p>
                            <p>The attempt of the popocratic organ to make political capital out of the concessions to union labor under pretext of promoting the interests of the exposition will not be tamely submitted to by republicans.  The supporters and friends of Sheriff McDonald have contributed as much toward the exposition as Tom Hoctor and his friends.  Nor will the other candidates on the republican ticket look with indifference upon the indiscreet course of the self-styled friends of the exposition who have made the popocratic paper the repository of funds raised to help carry the bond proposition which are being used to prop up the waning fortunes of the mongrel county ticket.</p>
                            <p>There was nothing improper in hiring space to boom the bonds in the World-Herald, which is notoriously for sale to all parties.  It is of very doubtful propriety, however, to make any political newspaper an exposition canvassing agency when it is apparent that the canvassers have a political mission to which the exposition business is more or less subordinated.</p>
                            <p>The managers of the exposition have from the outset endeavored to steer clear of all political entanglements.  Unless that policy is adhered to the success of the great enterprise will be seriously jeopardized.  If it was deemed necessary to organize a systematic campaign for the bonds it should have been done on a strictly non-partisan basis.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MRS. FORD RETURNS FROM NASHVILLE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Tells of Her Efforts in Securing Conventions for Omaha During the Exposition Year&#8212;Congress of Liberal Religions.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Mrs. Frances M. Ford, secretary of the Woman's Board of Managers of the exposition, has returned from Nashville, where she attended the meeting of the Congress of Liberal Religions and succeeded in having Omaha selected as the place for the meeting next year.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Ford also attended the annual meeting of the National Council of Women, a body composed of representatives of the various national organizations of women in the United States, and feels confident that this organization will be added to the list of national bodies which will meet in Omaha next year.  She did not wait until the question of location had been settled, but did considerable missionary work among the members of the body and secured promises from such women as Susan B. Anthony, Anna Garland Spencer, May Wright Sewell and Mrs. Kate B. Sherwood that they would work for Omaha.  The question of location is usually left to a committee, and Mrs. Ford says she feels hopeful that her missionary work will bear fruit.</p>
                            <p>Concerning the Congress of Liberal Religions, Mrs. Ford said she was the only attendant at the meeting from Omaha, but she bore an invitation from a committee appointed to invite the congress to Omaha next year.  This committee consisted of Rev. T. J. Mackay, John McQuoid, Rev. Newton M. Mann, Rev. Mary Girard Andrews and Thomas Kilpatrick.  Mrs. Ford says that when the invitation was read the delegates in the congress laid especial stress upon the fact that the names of two ministers of orthodox churches, Rev. Mackay and Rev. McQuoid, appeared on the invitation.  Comment was made that this indicated that the ministers of Omaha were broad-minded and liberal in their religious views.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">CLERGYMEN OF NASHVILLE.</head>
                            <p>Mrs. Ford said she realized the cause of these expressions when she learned that the ministers of Nashville had hotly opposed the coming of the congress to that city, contending that it was a scandalous and disgraceful thing and would forever disgrace the churches of the city.  Mrs. Ford says that several of the clergymen of Nashville preached against the congress while it was there and betrayed the most bigoted and narrow views regarding its purpose.</p>
                            <p>In speaking of the course of the Nashville ministers, Mrs. Ford expressed surprise that preachers who were so active in fighting against advanced views in religious matters should show such apathy and indifference regarding some of the shows in the Midway of the Nashville exposition.  Mrs. Ford said some of the Nashville women had told her about the horrible exhibitions allowed to operate on the Midway, some of which were so indecent as to be indescribable.  These women said that no objection had been raised to them by the ministers and the women who protested had been helpless.</p>
                            <p>While in Nashville Mrs. Ford also attended a convocation of women's club, consisting of a gathering of delegates from clubs in the east and south, much in the nature of the regular meetings of the Federations of Woman's Clubs.  Mrs. Ford said a similar meeting will be held in Omaha next year, in view of the failure to secure the meeting of the federation, and she had been promised that the delegates from the east and south will stop in Omaha en route to attend the federation meeting in Denver.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Ford was enthusiastic regarding the reception which had been accorded the women in Nashville by the women of that city.  She said that after keeping open house for five months, the women of Nashville retained their genial manner and accorded all visitors a characteristic southern welcome which put them at perfect ease.</p>

                            <p>The strike on the part of the carpenters employed on the Mines building on the exposition grounds remains unchanged.  Nothing was being done on the building today, and both sides expressed confidence in their ability to win a victory.</p>
                            <p>W. L. May, a member of the Nebraska Fish commission, president of the American Fisheries society and commissioner for the fisheries section of the Transmississippi Exposition, is in New York in the interest of the exposition.  Mr. May stopped in Washington on his way to New York and arranged for a carload of 10,000 rainbow trout to be distributed in the trout streams of Nebraska.  These will be supplied by the United States Fish commission.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Transportation has received notice that all of the foreign express companies will handle goods intended for exhibition at the Transmississippi Exposition for the regular rates of express charges, without making the usual charges for lighter service, acting as forwarders.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Exposition Committee Discusses Plans for the Novel Structure.</head>
                            <p>The regular meeting and luncheon of the executive committee of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi auxiliary was held last evening, and, like all of the meetings since the luncheon attachment was added, was attended by a large number of the members.  The only matter that was up for consideration was the report made by the special committee directed to ascertain the location that could be obtained on the exposition grounds for the big three-story tepee that Council Bluffs proposes to erect on the grounds.  This committee reported that there were two locations available and desirable.  One was on Twentieth street, a block north of the Department of Concessions buildings, and the other was on the southeast corner of the grounds, near the State and County building sites.  Both of these sites are favorable for the display of the imposing structure that is under consideration by the members of the committee and which has become exceedingly popular with the general public.</p>
                            <p>Some discussion was had concerning the size of the building and a majority of the members were in favor of making its diameter 100 feet instead of 50, as at first suggested.  This would give a total floor area of about 6,000 square feet, which would furnish abundant room for the exhibits of all who desired to make a display in the building.</p>
                            <p>The special committee was given until next meeting to make further inquiry concerning the sites and select the one most desirable and report at the meeting to be held in the hotel next Thursday evening.  The committee was also instructed to report in detail the plans of the building and the cost of the structure, and for this purpose they will have to have full working plans prepared.  The construction of the building is so simple that the plans will be easily prepared, and both architects and contractors can estimate the cost very quickly.  The third floor has been suggested as a good place to make an exhibit of curios and Indian relics.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition held a short session at noon yesterday and approved the plans for the parking of the bluff tract as prepared by Rudolf Ulrich, the landscape architect employed for the purpose.  This plan provides for a broad avenue, running north and south through the bluff tract from the grand plaza opposite the viaduct, leading from the main court to the southern extremity of the ground.  Side avenues branch out from the main thoroughfare to the State and other buildings located on this part of the grounds, and all of the walks are bordered with shade trees.  Manager Kirkendall was authorized to employ the men necessary for carrying out Mr. Ulrich's plan and to secure the necessary trees.</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">THE OBSTACLE REMOVED.</hi></head>
                            <p>The announcement of the retirement of Dion Geraldine from the superintendency of the exposition grounds and buildings will be hailed with satisfaction by every true friend of the exposition.  The importation of Geraldine at a salary of $500 per month has from the outset been a source of disaffection among stockholders and a cause of constant friction with contractors and workingmen.  His retention in the service of the exposition in the face of overwhelming adverse public sentiment impaired popular confidence in the management and seriously jeopardized the prospect of the exposition bond proposition.  Thousands of citizens whose loyalty to the exposition can not be questioned had determined to vote against the bonds if Geraldine was retained, while other thousands were hesitating as to whether it would be safe to vote for the bonds knowing that a man whom they distrusted was to be a potential factor in the expenditure of their money.</p>
                            <p>With the positive assurance that Dion Geraldine has permanently severed his connection with the exposition every citizen who is interested in the growth and prosperity of Omaha and Douglas county should not only vote but work for the success of the bond proposition.  While the exposition is an assured fact, bonds or no bonds, its magnitude would be curtailed and the management seriously hampered by the refusal of the people of this county to grant that material aid which by rights they should contribute toward an enterprise that means so much for them as well as for Nebraska and the whole west.  In supporting the bond proposition the resident taxpayers indirectly compel the non-residents whose property values are being enhanced and who have not responded to the call for stock subscriptions to bear a small share of the burden of the exposition project.</p>
                            <p>Incidentally The Bee desires to emphasize that public sentiment that has insisted upon the retirement of Geraldine as a condition precedent to support of the bonds does not mean simply hostility to Geraldine as a man, but to the methods which he introduced into the work under his supervision.  The true friends of the exposition will insist that Geraldinism in every form shall be stamped out.  In other works, stockholders and the public will insist that business methods be pursued in the letting of contracts, the making of estimates, the purchase of material and the hiring of men.  They will insist that no favoritism be shown to any contractor or dealer in building material, that every condition in every contract shall be enforced and that every article purchased shall be delivered the same in quantity and quality as agreed on.</p>
                            <p>The Bee also voices public sentiment when it demands that the successor of Geraldine shall be an Omaha man who is known to our people and possesses their confidence.  While it was eminently proper to import experts for work that requires the experience of trained specialists, there is no call for a superintendent of construction from Chicago or any other city.  The costly $500-a-month experiment must not be repeated and will not be tolerated by those who have contributed to the exposition funds and have the real interests of the exposition at heart.</p>

                            <p>The resignation of Dion Geraldine as superintendent of construction in the Department of Buildings and Grounds was presented to the executive committee of the exposition at its regular meeting this afternoon by Manager Kirkendall and was accepted, thus entirely severing Geraldine's connection with the exposition.  The resignation is to be effective upon its acceptance and became operative at once.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Nearly 100 representatives of the skilled labor of Omaha and South Omaha met pursuant to a call in Labor temple last night.  The purpose of the gathering was to consider the attitude which organized labor should maintain toward the proposed issue of $100,000 of county bonds in aid of the exposition.  A report was also to be submitted from the committee which has been conferring with the exposition management regarding the fixing of a wage scale.</p>
                            <p>O. P. Schrum of the Building Trades' council was nominated as chairman of the meeting by acclamation and V. B. Kinney of the Central Labor union was installed as secretary.  The report of the conference committee was heard, which recited the wage scale agreed to by the exposition directory.  This was almost the same as had been drafted by the committee and the assembly was well pleased with the result.</p>
                            <p>A resolution was introduced to extend thanks to the exposition management for its readiness to grant the scale.  A loud and immediate opposition arose to this.  A member of the Painters' union stated that they had received only what belonged to them.  He did not see that he would thank any one, least of all G. M. Hitchcock, whom he had always known as opposed to organized labor, especially during the recent painters' strike.  A number of others spoke in the same spirit and the resolution was snowed under.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WAS ONLY THEIR DUE.</head>
                            <p>A vote of thanks to the committee and especially to Fred M. Youngs, as the representative of labor on the executive board, was then placed before the house.  A persevering member again endeavored to tack on an amendment tendering thanks to the whole board, but the opposition was so vigorous that he recognized the necessity of withdrawing it.  One of the striking carpenters present freed his mind on the latter question.  He said that it was a business proposition, and repeated that labor had only received its just due.  He would feel in a more grateful mood, he stated, if the directory had not yesterday deprived them of their ground passes, thus denying them the right to impart their view of the situation to the outside men who might apply for work.  Not satisfied with this verdict, the subject was again put in the form of a motion and was again defeated.</p>
                            <p>Incidentally the matter of the Geraldine regime was brought up and vigorously treated by many workmen who have felt the insults and hardship of his rule.  It was asserted that there could be no hope of carrying a bond proposition so long as the present suspicion of the superintendent of construction lodged in the minds of the people.  Accordingly, a resolution was read by F. A. Kennedy, in which Geraldine's withdrawal was requested of the exposition directory.  Upon this a clause, thanking the directory for its recent action, was finally engrafted, and the resolution passed as follows:</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WANT GERALDINE REMOVED.</head>
                            <p>Whereas, The directory of the Transmississippi Exposition has unanimously adopted a resolution granting the request of organized labor in reference to the wage scale and hours of labor constituting a day's work; therefore be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That organized labor return a vote of thanks to the executive committee for its considerate action upon our reasonable request.</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The long delay incident to the discussion and consideration of our demands has raised a hostile feeling toward voting the bonds desired by the directory in the minds of the great mass of unorganized labor over whom we have no control, though now desiring in every way to carry said bonds, we regret to say that we still recognize the employment of Dion Geraldine by the directory as the chief obstacle to our labor and success in carrying the bonds, and we hereby respectfully ask the directory to permanently remove him at once, as their doing so would lend us the <choice><sic>neecssary</sic><corr>necessary</corr></choice> assistance to success.</p>
                            <p>A manifesto presented by W. H. Bell provoked further discussion.  It was a typewritten appeal for support for the bonds apparently carefully prepared in advance.  One member wanted to make its publication conditional on the removal of Geraldine, and his remarks were seconded in several quarters, but finally the address was agreed to as follows, without opposition:</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">ADDRESS TO CONFERENCE.</head>
                            <p>To the Laboring Classes of Douglas County, whether Organized or Unorganized, Skilled or Common&#8212;Greeting: The members and officers of the Central Labor union and the members and officers of the Omaha Building Trades council, at a meeting called for the purpose, have authorized the following statement to be made and appeal issued to all classes of labor in Douglas county:</p>
                            <p>In protesting the rights and supporting the interests of the laboring classes of this community the labor unions of this city have for some time had differences with the management of the exposition regarding a scale of wages and the hours of work.  These differences have been made public and from time to time the discussions arising out of them have tended to place organized labor in an apparent antagonism to the exposition.  The real facts, are, however, that organized labor has never been antagonistic to the exposition, but only struggling to protect its interests and at the same time the interests of unorganized labor.</p>
                            <p>The first fruits of these efforts resulted in securing from the management of the exposition a resolution that the minimum wages paid for common labor should be $1.50 per day and the last fruits of these efforts have been the passage of a resolution affording to skilled labor the eight-hour day and union scale of wages.</p>
                            <p>With these differences adjusted organized labor once more stands in harmony with the management of the exposition.  From the very inception of this great enterprise organized labor has been its advocate and its supporter.  Even in the times of seeming antagonism it has at heart been true to the exposition project, because it has been very confident that all classes of this community would reap great and lasting benefits from it.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">DEMAND FOR LABOR.</head>
                            <p>These expectations have not been disappointed.  Already we see on every hand in this community the rapidly increasing
                            
                            <pb n="96" xml:id="TMISB03-096"/>
                            
                            demand for labor.  Already we see a disposition to undertake the new public and private enterprises which must give employment to labor.  And now that the exposition management has conceded for common labor and for skilled labor, for organized labor and for unorganized labor, a scale of wages which will enable the laboring classes of Omaha to care for their families in the proper way, we feel confident that the result will be a great improvement in this city within the next few years.  The union scale and the eight-hour day upon the exposition grounds means the union scale and the eight-hour day throughout the city of Omaha and South Omaha.</p>
                            <p>There now only remains one thing lacking to make the exposition all that we have expected it to be, and that is the voting of the $100,000 in bonds by Douglas county at the election next Tuesday.  The failure to vote these bonds would mean more than the loss of $100,000 to the laboring interests of this city; it would mean a black eye to the exposition.  It would mean a cutting down of plans, not only on exposition buildings yet to be let, but it would mean the abandonment of numerous private projects dependent on the exposition and destined to give much employment to the laborer.</p>
                            <p>To defeat the bonds would be to announce to the world that we had no faith in the exposition at home and that the promised support which it was to receive from the people of Omaha and South Omaha had not materialized.  Such an announcement would greatly reduce the attendance at the exposition, and greatly reduce the quantity of money which we hope to be brought to Omaha and left in Omaha by the visiting thousands.</p>
                            <p>We therefore appeal to the laboring men of Omaha and South Omaha, whether they are engaged in the building trades or in other occupations, to vote for these bonds at the coming election for the reason that they mean a greater demand for labor and better times for all classes.</p>
                            <p>To those of the laboring class who are taxpayers and who may feel that the voting of these bonds means an increase of taxes we beg to say that it is insignificant; if you pay taxes on a tax valuation of $500 the voting of the bonds will only increase your taxes 22 cents a year, or less than 2 cents a month.</p>
                            <p>We, therefore, having fought this fight and won this victory in the interests of labor, appeal to those for whom we have fought to ratify our action, to register on Saturday and on Tuesday to give their hearty support to the bond proposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Approve of the Concessions Made to Organized Labor.</head>
                            <p>The action of the executive committee of the exposition in recognizing the rules and wage scale of organized labor as the standard to govern in the letting of all future contracts and in all work to be done on the grounds by the exposition management, was ratified by the Board of Directors of the exposition at a special meeting held yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>When the meeting was called to order there were thirty directors present and the object of the meeting was presented in a communication from the executive committee informing the directors of the action of the committee in adopting a resolution providing that in future contracts and in work done by the exposition eight hours should constitute a day's work, and the scale of wages in force by the labor unions October 1, 1897, should be recognized as the standard of wages to be paid.  The official statement of the officers of the Central Labor union as to the wage scale was attached to this communication, the detail of wages provided for the several lines of mechanics being as follows: Carpenters, 30 cents per hour; bricklayers, 50 cents per hour; plasterers, 50 cents per hour; painters and decorators, 30 cents per hour; plumbers, steam fitters and gas fitters, 45 cents per hour; sheet metal workers, 30 cents per hour; staff workers, modellers, 50 cents per hour; staff workers, lasters, 30 cents per hour.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kountze asked if the adoption of this resolution would in any way affect existing contracts, and if provision was made for pay for extra time or for work at night or Sundays.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock, chairman of the special committee to which the labor resolution had been referred, explained that the resolution covered this by providing that extra shifts of eight hours could be worked without paying extra time.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lindsey said the executive committee had been considering the labor question for several months and believed that this method was the best that could be pursued.  He said the committee had taken legal advice and was satisfied that existing contracts would not be affects by the passage of the resolution.</p>
                            <p>The question on the adoption of the resolution was put to vote and it was adopted without a dissenting voice.</p>
                            <p>Director Youngs, the representative of organized labor he wished to thank the board for what it had done in passing this resolution.  He said that the members of organized labor he wished to thank the board for what it had done in passing this resolution.  He said that the members of organized labor were heartily in favor of the exposition and wished to see it made a complete success, and he pledged the support of organized labor to assist the exposition in every way.</p>
                            <p>After appointing a committee, consisting of Directors Hitchcock, Wharton and Kountze, to prepare an address to the voters of the country urging them to support the exposition bonds, the meeting adjourned.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Omaha Men Vary Widely in Their Figures, but None Get Inside the $50,000 Appropriation.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, Oct. 29.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Supervising Architect Taylor opened bids today for the erection and complete construction of the government building at Omaha next year.  Fifteen bidders signified their desire to do the work, the bids ranging from $51,250 to $75,754.  Omaha bidders were largely in the majority, Peter Soudenberg bidding $51,250; C. W. Partridge, $58,797; E. C. Wakefield, $59,515; Henry Hamann, $60,432; A. W. Phelps &amp; Son, $63,325; Walter Peterson, $63,400; P. H. Mahaney, $64,207; Goldie Brothers, $64,000; Bassett &amp; Percival, $68,750; Counsman &amp; Givin, $74,456; Hamilton Brothers, $75,574.  Other bids came from Meridian, Miss., Nashville, Tenn., and Chicago.</p>
                            <p>Supervising Architect Taylor, in speaking of the bids said he was greatly astonished at the large amounts asked for construction of the building, in view of the fact that congress has appropriated but $50,000 for the building.  It was the hope of the officials in the supervising architect's office that the bid for construction of the building would be at a figure which would permit the construction of the life saving service building within the amount appropriated by congress.  But if the contractors cannot see their way clear to construct the building on the plans as laid down, either the life saving service must go by the board or else an additional appropriation must be asked from congress for the life saving service.  Architect Taylor intimated that there were a number of alternative propositions which would have to be applied to bids scaling them down to meet the appropriations.  One bid might come within the limit set by congress.  It will be necessary, however, to recast the bids, and this will be done at once in order that the new bids may be invited should it be found necessary.  Soudenberg agrees to complete this building in five and a half months from the time of securing the contract.  This was about the length of time all the contractors wanted in which to erect the structure.  There were five bids for plaster casts, all by Washington contractors, Fred E. Lemier, being the lowest, $2,250.  If this amount is added to Soudenberg's bid which is $1,250 over the government appropriation, it will be seen that both bids are $3,500 above the limit set by congress.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Joseph Hayden Concludes Not to Present a Showing.</head>
                            <p>The case in Justice Foster's court in which the Western Bank Note and Engraving company is seeking to collect a judgment obtained in Chicago against Dion Geraldine came up for hearing yesterday morning on the order directed to Joseph Hayden directing him to appear and show the consideration given by him to Geraldine for the assignments of Geraldine's salary as an employe of the exposition up to and including July 14, 1898.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hayden appeared with an attorney, who said he had just been called into the case and he requested a postponement until afternoon to give him an opportunity to consult with his client.  This was granted and the case was set for hearing at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon.  When that time arrived the attorney sent word that his client had concluded to make no further appearance in the case.</p>
                            <p>In view of this sudden termination of the case the attorney representing the plaintiff asked the court to declare the assignments fraudulent and void.  In support of this position the attorney called the court's attention to a section in the chapter on frauds in the statutes of Nebraska, which provides that assignments given for future consideration are illegal and void as to creditors, either existing or subsequent.  He also called the court's attention to the statement of Mr. Hayden filed in the case, which showed on its face that at the time the assignments were made, March 12, this year, Geraldine was indebted to Mr. Hayden for $1,707.50, and that the remainder of the assignment, as stated on its face, was to cover future credits and loans to be made to Geraldine.</p>
                            <p>Upon this showing Justice Foster entered an order finding that the assignments were void and of no force.  He also made an order upon the exposition management to pay into court $125 of the money due Geraldine, to be held until the trial of the case, November 11.</p>
                            <p>Immediately following this decision another case was commenced against Geraldine to collect a judgment recovered in Chicago by James H. Shunk for $160 on a promissory note.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The situation at the exposition grounds was improved this morning and the air of suspense and uncertainty which had been in evidence for several weeks had entirely disappeared.  The work was progressing fairly well and the workmen seemed to take hold with a new vigor.  With the exception of the two buildings for which Goldie &amp; Sons have the contract, the Mines and Agriculture, the work of construction was making good headway.  Three gangs of men were at work laying the water mains and a large force was at work on the bluff tract carrying out the landscape plans.  The inspection of the buildings was being done under the direction of M. S. Ralls, who has been in charge of the engineering work on the grounds since the beginning.</p>
                            <p>Geraldine was not on the grounds and had not been seen there since yesterday morning.  It was <choice><sic>curerntly</sic><corr>currently</corr></choice> reported on the grounds and about the streets that Geraldine went to Chicago last night, but his chief clerk, Templeton, claimed to know nothing about his late chief's whereabouts.  A lot of stuff belonging to Geraldine, such as wearing apparel, books and other personal property, is at the new office of the Department of Buildings and Grounds in the white cottage on the bluff tract, and it is supposed that he will return to Omaha to take this away.</p>
                            <p>The strike on the Mines building is still strongly in evidence, not a man being at work on the building.  <choice><sic>Thestrike</sic><corr>The strike</corr></choice> committee has a large delegation at each gate opening into the Kountze tract and these men say that they have turned away a large number of men who were looking for work, but who refused to proceed any further when they learned the situation.  The strikers say a gang of carpenters came in from Des Moines last night, but they were met at the depot by a delegation from the carpenters' union and declined to go to work.  The strikers express the greatest confidence in their ability to win and say they are using all honorable means to accomplish their purpose.  They say that Goldie will certainly yield within a few days and that they will then turn their attention to the other contractors.</p>

                            <p>Goldie has advertised in the newspapers for 100 carpenters, and says he will not yield to the demands of the union, but will on Monday next pt on as large a force of men as can be handled, both on the Mines and Agricultural buildings.  A small gang of about fifteen men are working on the Agricultural building.  The driving of the piles for this building is about completed and the work of laying the floor progressing slowly.</p>
                            <p>Contractor Parrish has <choice><sic>commencer</sic><corr>commenced</corr></choice> driving piles for the Liberal Arts building.  All of his piles are at hand, and he expects to have them driven by the middle of next week.  A large amount of his lumber is on the ground, and he says he will rush the work as fast as possible.  He says he will not yield to the labor unions, but will employ men regardless of whether they belong to the union or not and will work ten hours or as long as may be necessary.</p>
                            <p>Contractor Hamilton is moving along with the Machinery building with the same force of men he has had from the first.  The south wall is going up slowly.  He still maintains that he will not yield to the labor unions.</p>
                            <p>The Manufactures building is gradually assuming form.  The walls are up and the work of putting on the roof is going ahead slowly.  About forty-five men are at work on the building, but experts say that four times as many men could be handled to advantage.  The staff contractors are making good progress on this building, the main cornice being nearly all in position and the interior of the dome being well covered with the staff.  The ornate base about the flagstaff surmounting the central dome is being put in place and making a good appearance.</p>
                            <p>Three gangs of men are at work laying the water mains and the work is nearly completed.</p>
                            <p>On the bluff tract a large force of men is at work on the main avenue, grading out for the roadway and excavating large holes for the shade trees which are to grace each side of the broad street running north and south through the center of this tract.  Landscape Architect Ulrich has returned to New York while this work is being done, but when the preparatory work is completed he will come to Omaha and personally supervise the transplanting of the large trees which will be placed along each side of the avenue.</p>

                            <p>OMAHA, Oct. 26.&#8212;F. P. Kirkendall, Manager Department of Buildings and Grounds, Transmississippi and International Exposition: Dear Sir&#8212;I am informed that it is claimed by certain parties or elements that my retention as superintendent of your department threatens the success of the county bonds of $100,000 for the exposition to be voted next week.</p>
                            <p>While I feel keenly the utter injustice of such claim, I cannot consent to be in any sense or in any degree an obstacle to the success of the exposition.  I therefore tender my resignation, to take effect at your option.</p>
                            <p>I shall always be deeply grateful to you for the manly, unwavering support and confidence you have given me, and I am thankful to your executive committee for its kind indulgence and endorsement and to your special committee of the directory for its fearless vindication of my character and ability.  <choice><sic>Yery</sic><corr>Very</corr></choice> truly yours,</p>
                            <signed>DION GERALDINE.</signed>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>After the meeting had dissolved Manager Kirkendall stated that he had not decided upon any person to succeed Geraldine and that no action on this matter had been taken in the meeting.</p>
                            <p>Aside from the acting on this resignation the committee transacted a small amount of business.</p>
                            <p>R. W. Richardson was appointed commissioner for Missouri to represent the Department of Exhibits.  He will endeavor to enlist the interest of the state officers in the exposition and secure the appointment of a commission to see that Missouri is properly represented at the exposition and will also visit the manufacturers and business men and arouse an interest on their part.</p>
                            <p>In view of the formal relations which have heretofore existed between the Nebraska Exposition commission and the executive committee it was decided that the members of the commission should be invited to meet with the committee at an early date for an interchange of ideas with a view of harmonizing the different interests and securing unity of action.  President Wattles was authorized to make arrangements for such a meeting.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall presented the bids which were received early in the week for furnishing and driving the piling for the Art building.  There were two bids, A. A. Raymond, offering to furnish and drive the piles for 12½ cents per foot, and F. B. Green, offering to do the work for ll cents per foot.  The contract was awarded to Green.</p>
                            <p>The location of the Service building was changed on the recommendation of Manager Kirkendall, and it will be erected on the west side of Twentieth street, north of the Administration building, instead of on the east side, as formerly agreed upon.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Buildings and Grounds was authorized to put flush tanks on the Kountze tract and on the bluff tract for the purpose of flushing sewers on the exposition grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Geraldine's Withdrawal Gives the Most Intense Satisfaction.</head>
                            <p>The news of the withdrawal of Dion Geraldine from his position as general superintendent under the exposition directory was a cause for the most intense satisfaction throughout the ranks of organized labor.  It has aroused a general expression of renewed enthusiasm for the exposition and added confidence in its management.</p>
                            <p>J. H. Tracy, secretary of the Carpenters' union, brought out especially the effect of the action yesterday upon unorganized labor.  "The skilled workmen," he said, "have been in a measure appeased by the action of the directory in recognizing a wage scale.  This has no bearing, however, upon common workmen and they all regard the withdrawal of Geraldine in the light of an especial recognition.  I have also been brought in to contact with a large number of the employes of the street car system and I am certain that this contention regarding Geraldine will completely change the weight of their influence."</p>
                            <p>O. P. Schrum, chairman of the mass meeting of skilled workmen held Thursday night, spoke from a knowledge of the shops and smelter.  "There are 700 workmen in the railroad yards and 900 in the smelter," said Mr. Schrum, "and their delegates to our meetings have felt the Geraldine matter to be a certain obstacle to the bond issue.  With that removed their vote will be practically unanimous for the bonds."</p>
                            <p>W. H. Bell, <choice><sic>presidentof</sic><corr>president of</corr></choice> the Central Labor union, was a member of the state committee which favorable reported at the meeting Thursday night.  He said that it was only on the understanding that Geraldine would withdraw that the mass meeting of organized labor had issued the manifesto in favor of the bonds on that night.</p>
                            <p>Fred M. Youngs, the representative of organized labor on the board of directors, was also instrumental in the issuance of the bonds manifesto and believed that the assurance of Geraldine's withdrawal made it possible.</p>
                            <p>E. B. Egan, a member of the strike committee of the Carpenters' union, stated his belief that yesterday's action in the directors' meeting would pass the bonds if anything on earth could avail to do it.  "If Geraldine could have gone long ago," he said, "the trouble of the carpenters would never have arisen."</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Scott of the Labor temple said that it was easily apparent that the retirement of the general superintendent would change the verdict on the bonds from "no" to "yes."  He stated that the figures at his command justified him in saying that it would make a change of 5,000 votes in the ranks of labor alone.  Not only that, but he estimated that $20,000 would shortly come in on delinquent stock assessments from those who owned small numbers of shares.</p>
                            <p>Tucker Turner of the Building Trades' council said that the building trades had naturally been in direct contact with the exposition management and felt as none others could the injustice and favoritism of the general superintendent.  It was his opinion that the change of rule would make not only the bond issue certain, but would brighten the outlook in numberless other ways.</p>

                            <p>The work of the Lady Board of Managers of the exposition in collecting funds for the erection of the Girls' and Boys' will be pushed actively this week with the intention of completing the fund so that the building may be commenced as soon, as possible.  Various members of the executive committee have visited the public schools in this city during the past month and have visited the public schools in this city during the past month and have explained the purpose of the building proposed to be erected on the exposition grounds as a resting place for the children may have them cared for while they inspect the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Great interest has been aroused among the school children, and it has been determined to designate Friday of this week, November 5, as a "rally day," when special attention will be given to collecting the contribution of each child to the building fund.  Each child or adult subscribing $1 will receive a receipt for the amount subscribed, each share being valued at 5 cents.  The school teachers will keep accurate lists of the contributors and the amount of their subscription, and a receipt will be sent to each stockholder from the office of the secretary of the woman's board.</p>
                            <p>For the purpose of carrying out the plan to the fullest extent and canvassing the various school districts, a number of patronesses have been appointed, and these women will do all in their power to stir up interest in the matter during the coming week.  The following is the list of women who have been assigned to this duty: Mesdames David Cole, Charles Gratten, J. M. Gillan, A. H. Head, Warren Switzler, George Smalley, Rockfellow, A. C. Riddell, A. N. Ferguson, E. A. Parmelee, E. B. Cole, R. E. McKelvey, Dinning, Whinnery, C. S. Stebbins, P. Milbrodt, H. D. Neeley and H. B. Corywell, and Emma Wheeler.</p>

                            <p>The executive for the Wisconsin Exposition commission has been appointed by the chairman of the commission, ex-Mayor John C. Koch, of Milwaukee, as follows: August Uihlein, John E. Hansen, A. C. Clas, J. A. Watrous, Ferdinand Kieckhefer, all of Milwaukee; E. E. Bryant of Madison, W. T. Lewis of Racine, John Hicks of Oshkosh, Mrs. Caroline H. Bell of Milwaukee and Miss Ella Roberts of Waukesha.  Mr. Koch will be chairman of the executive committee as well as of the entire commission.</p>
                            <p>Wisconsin is making preparations to make a conspicuous display of its honey industry.  The Badger state claims to stand in the front rank as the producer of the best honey and Newell France of Plateville, state inspector of dairies, is making arrangements for a state exhibit.  He has asked that a prominent place be reserved for this exhibit and is working up an interest in the matter among the beekeepers of Wisconsin.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Plan for Hastening Construction of Government Building Discussed.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee held a short conference this morning regarding the condition of affairs with relation to the government building.  The dispatch from Washington this morning, showing that the lowest bid for the construction of this building exceeded the appropriation, caused considerable apprehension in the minds of the members of the committee, as a re-advertisement for new bids meant a long delay.</p>
                            <p>The lowest bidder on the building stipulates that he must have five months in which to complete the building, and this would carry the construction up to the first of May, so that any further delay would seriously interfere with the opening of the building on time.  The situation was discussed in all its bearings and it was finally decided to first ascertain what course the government is likely to pursue in the matter and to follow this with prompt action to prevent any further delay.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Goldie &amp; Sons Agree to Recognize Union Rules.</head>
                            <p>The strike on the Mines building on the exposition grounds came to an end last night, the striking carpenters gaining their point and winning Contractor Goldie's consent to a contract whereby union men are to be hereafter employed on the buildings for which Mr. Goldie has the contract, and they are to be paid the full union scale of 30 cents per hour, eight hours to constitute a working day.  The carpenters conceded a point insisted on by Mr. Goldie, agreeing to work on Sunday at the regular rate.</p>
                            <p>On this basis a force of thirty-eight men will go to work on the Mines building this morning and the work of construction will be pushed as rapidly as possible.</p>
                            <p>This makes three buildings now under construction which have been unionized, the Manufactures, Mines and Agriculture.  The next move on the part of the carpenters will be to induce Hamilton Brothers, contractors for the Machinery building, and W. H. Parrish, who has the Liberal Arts building, to consent to enforce the union rules on these buildings.  Both contractors insist that they will do nothing of the kind, but Contractors Goldie and Strehlow, who have yielded, both said the same thing.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Transportation is in receipt of a notice from the chairman of the Transmissouri freight bureau announcing that agricultural products intended for exhibition at the exposition will be carried both ways free of charge from all points in Nebraska.

                            <head type="sub">Exposition is Ordered to Pay the Money Into Court.</head>
                            <p>The case of the Toby Furniture company of Chicago against Dion Geraldine came up in the municipal court yesterday afternoon, being a hearing on the order issued last week directed against Joseph Hayden and citing him to appear and show cause why he should not pay the judgment of $99.35 rendered against Geraldine in the municipal court.</p>
                            <p>This was the case in which Geraldine filed his affidavit that the testimony of W. H. Tamm was absolutely necessary for his defense against the bill for furniture bought in Chicago in February, 1895, and where he asked for a continuance until Tamm returned from Europe.  When the case was called for trial Geraldine did not appear at all and a judgment was rendered in default.  The exposition was garnisheed to pay the judgment out of money due Geraldine for salary, and at the same time an order was directed against Joseph Hayden to appear and show why he should not allow the judgment to be paid.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wakefield appeared for the exposition and produced the assignments of Geraldine's salary to Mr. Hayden, covering the period up to and including July 14, 1898, at $500 per month.  Mr. Hayden did not appear and, after taking the testimony of Wakefield, which was the same as that given in the case in Justice Foster's court in a similar case, the court entered an order, finding that the assignments to Hayden were void as to the judgment in the municipal court, and ordering the exposition to pay into court the amount of the judgment with interest and costs, the total being $119.88 out of money due Geraldine for services in October.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Address to the Voters of Douglas County.</head>
                            <p>The following appeal to the voters of this county has been made by friends of the Transmississippi Exposition in behalf of the bonds:</p>
                            <p>To the Voters of Douglas County: The undersigned members of the exposition directory feel called upon at this time to lay before the voters of all classes in Douglas county this brief statement:</p>
                            <p>Less than a year ago, when this community was perhaps in the lowest depth of its prolonged depression and when the exposition was little more than a possibility of the future, we accepted from some 6,000 stockholders the responsibilities and duties of exposition directors.  Since that time the exposition project has encountered difficulties and passed through dangers that at times threatened disaster.  From one after another, however, the enterprise has emerged larger and stronger after each struggle, and we feel justified in saying that it has now passed from a formative period and assumed the shape and proportions of a great reality.</p>
                        
                            <pb n="98" xml:id="TMISB03-098"/>
                            
                            <p>Final action has been taken by congress and complete recognition by the national government has been secured.  The state appropriation and the co-operation of other states have been brought about.  Nearly $500,000 in private stock subscriptions have been pledged and a large amount of work has already been done upon the grounds.  From the depression which prevailed in this community a year ago we have passed into a period of hope, activity and prospective growth.  A large part of the credit of this change is due to the exposition.  Now, however, we have reached a point in this undertaking where it is necessary to have the united and overwhelming endorsement of the people of this county.  At all times since the beginning of the exposition it has been contemplated that Douglas county would contribute at least $100,000 to the enterprise and all the plans have been made with that expectation.</p>
                            <p>On Tuesday next will be given the opportunity and the only opportunity for the people of Douglas county to say whether they will fulfill the expectations and make good the assurances of public support.</p>
                            <p>As a business proposition we consider that the voting of $100,000 aid by the county of Douglas to this exposition is a good investment for the community.  With it the exposition will be able to carry out the plans and intentions of the projectors with a reasonable certainty of making a success of the exposition.  Without this $100,000 plans must be modified, changed and reduced to an extent that would be at least a serious detriment to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>If this were all we might say, "Let it be; there is room for reduction; the exposition can still be held."  But this is not all, because it has gone forth to all parts of this country that the people of Douglas county intended to vote $100,000 for the exposition.  If by any mischance this assurance should not be made good we fear that the world at large will take the failure as an indication that the exposition does not have the support and approval of the people of this community.  In short, we fear that the failure to vote these bonds might result in a greatly reduced demand for exhibit space and a greatly reduced attendance of visitors.</p>
                            <p>We, therefore, being in a position to know the circumstances of the exposition, and being advised of the manner in which the project is regarded by the outside world, place these facts before our fellow citizens and invoke their public spirit in the support of these bonds.  They can only be carried by a two-thirds vote of all those electors voting on the proposition.  This proposition should, in our opinion, have the support of the business men, whether large or small, for the increased business it will bring.  It should have the support of the wage earner, whether common or skilled, for the reason of the largely increased employment it will give.  In our opinion the project is one which is vital to the interests of the whole community, and we believe that the voting of these bonds will not only serve to place the amount of money where the county commissioners can expend it for the benefit of the exposition, but it will as well be a vote of confidence in the exposition itself, which will go out to all the world as the best evidence of the magnitude and importance of the exposition project.  Respectfully submitted,</p>

                            <p>The Midway of the Transmississippi Exposition promises to equal the amusement feature of any exposition ever held in this country.  It will cover considerable ground and will be arranged in a manner which will afford concessionaires all the accommodations which could possibly be desired.  There will be no remote corners, as at the World's fair, where attractions were located so far from the entrance that the visitors to the street "dropped" their money long before they reached the end, and, as a natural result, the attractions located away from the upper end of the street were financial failures.</p>
                            <p>The amusement street has not been formally named, Manager Reed having a standing offer of $10 for the best suggestion for a name, but the locality had been generally alluded to as the "Midway," and there seems to be no disposition to change this designation.  It is not altogether inappropriate, as the "street" will form two sides of a square and visitors to the exposition cannot from the main court to either the bluff tract or the north section of the grounds without passing the Midway.  The amusement street will have its lower end at the viaduct leading across Sherman avenue to the bluff tract, and in order to reach the north tract from the bluff park it will be necessary to pass through the Midway from end to end, the street extending north to the viaduct leading across Sherman avenue to the old fair grounds tract and thence west to Twentieth street, being one-half mile in length.</p>
                            <p>A pleasing feature of the Midway will be the viaduct across Sherman avenue at the north end of the street.  This viaduct will be so constructed as to avoid the impression that the visitor is passing over a viaduct.  The approach to it will be gradual and it will be lined on either side with numerous small booths, which will completely shut out all view of the street and convey the impression that the visitor is inside the grounds all the time.  These booths will be filled with dainty wares of various kinds and will form a section from the market of one of the old country rural districts.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SIX CONTRACTS LET.</head>
                            <p>Contracts are being made very slowly for attractions on the Midway, the policy of Manager Reed being to make contracts with only such attractions as are of the highest class and desirable in every way.  There are scores of applications on file in the concessions department, but only six contracts have been made up to this time.  These include the Chinese village, the Moorish village, a Street of Cairo, Shooting the Chutes, Sherman's umbrella and Cripple Creek.</p>
                            <p>The Chinese village was one of the first concessions to be let, Hong Sling, a native of the "Flowery Kingdom," being the concessionaire.  He has secured permission from the Treasury department to import 450 of his almond-eyed countrymen to populate the Chinese village and promises to have a show that will be a correct representation of a section from one of the populous cities of his native land.  Sling was concerned in the Chinese village at the World's fair and is backed by ample capital and strong influence.  The Chinese village will stand at the west end of the Midway, adjoining Twentieth street.  It will be a walled city and within the frowning stone wall will be genuine Chinese bazaars, a restaurant, joss house, theater and all the other things that go to make up a Chinese city.</p>
                            <p>Shooting the Chutes will be the old familiar slide ending in a broad basin of water.  This concession was let to Omaha parties who propose to erect a slide with all the latest improvements and safety appliances.  It will be located at the southeast corner of the old fair grounds tract just at the west end of the viaduct.</p>
                            <p>The plans for the Moorish village and Street of Cairo are not matured sufficiently to warrant an attempt to give a detailed description of these concessions.  Both will be located on the bluff tract.</p>

                            <p>Sherman's umbrella will be located on the old fair grounds tract north of Shooting the Chutes.  This mechanical novelty will be one of the most interesting engineering devices ever seen at an exposition.  It has been described in detail heretofore and further description is unnecessary.</p>
                            <p>One of the most interesting concessions on the ground will be located at the west end of the Midway, near Twentieth street and opposite the Chinese village.  This will be known as Cripple Creek, and it will be an exact fac-simile reproduction of the most famous mining town of recent times.  The town will be shown as it existed in its palmiest days "before the fire," when it was the center of attraction in the mining world during the years 1892 and 1893.  At that time the busy, bustling town consisted of a motley collection of houses, tents, "shacks" and log cabins, strung along on either side of a single street, lying in the narrow valley between towering hills, whose sides were dotted with cabins and pierced with prospectors' shafts.  The place was "wild and woolly" in the extreme and all this will be reproduced on the exposition ground in the most realistic manner.</p>
                            <p>This concession will occupy about 150,000 square feet of ground and this spot will be transformed into a mountainous region, with towering peaks on every side and the mining camp nestling rather restlessly in the valley.  The houses forming the town will be exact reproductions of the grotesque buildings which constituted the central portions of the town before the whole street was wiped out of existence by fire.  These buildings will be modeled from photographs of the originals taken before the fire, and in addition there will be a number of log cabins which were around the outskirts of the town and thus escaped destruction.  These cabins will be brought here bodily and erected on the ground.</p>

                            <head type="sub">BUSINESS HOUSES REPRODUCED.</head>
                            <p>There will be between fifty and sixty buildings in the town, among them being a dance hall, in which there will be held the wild dances which characterized these resorts during the palmy days of the cowboy, a hotel, variety theater, general merchandise stores, drug stores, newspaper office, postoffice, express office, barber shop, meat market, carpenter shop, lodging houses, etc.</p>
                            <p>About 300 people will inhabit the town, the majority of them being actual residents of the old Cripple Creek.  To add more realism to the scene genuine mountain stage coaches, "mud wagons" and freight wagons, will do business in the town all the time, the stage coaches making regular trips through town and up the mountain pass until it disappears in the distance, only to return again by way of the main entrance gate with a fresh load of passengers.  Trains of burros will pass through town at regular intervals, receiving and delivering freight and doing business on a realistic plane.</p>
                            <p>This concession is in the hands of Norris &amp; Love, experts in the show business, who have already taken steps to put their contract into active operation.  Mr. Love conceived, built and managed the '49 mining camp at the California Midwinter fair, which was the most popular attraction on the Midway of that exposition, and he gives every assurance that the Cripple Creek show will be far ahead of the California camp.  The arrangement of the ground and the erection of the buildings for this town will be pushed during the winter and everything will be in readiness when the exposition opens.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GOLDIE PUSHES WORK ON MINES BUILDING</head>
                            <head type="sub">Forty Carpenters Employed and the Number Will Be Increased as Needed&#8212;Activity on Other Buildings.</head>
                            <p>The exposition grounds have resumed their wonted aspect of activity and the erection of the main buildings is proceeding in a satisfactory manner.  The huge framework of the Mines building, which was deserted and bare during the greater part of last week on account of the strike of the carpenters, was covered with men this morning and the roof was rapidly being put on.  About forty men were at work and Contractor Goldie stated that he intended putting on more men as soon as they could be handled to advantage.</p>
                            <p>It is expected that the piles for the Agriculture building will be all driven by tomorrow night, and the contractor says the force on this building will be increased at that time.  At present the floor is being laid by a small force.</p>
                            <p>Considerable activity is being displayed on the other buildings and good headway is being made, although it is remarked by people who visit the grounds at intervals of a week or so that the progress made seems to be very slow.</p>
                            <p>The water is running into the lagoon from two small pipes connected with the city water mains and the artesian well flows a small quantity.  The bottom of the canal is covered with water from the Mirror to Twentieth street and the pipes east of Twentieth street have formed small puddles which almost cover the bottom on this part of the canal.</p>
                            <p>On the bluff tract good progress is being made with the parking.  The holes which are to receive the large trees which are to be planted along either side of the main avenue excite considerable curiosity on the part of visitors to the grounds, who ask all kind of questions about the numerous holes ten feet square and about five feet deep which are being excavated close together along the roadway which is being prepared by a large force of men and teams with plows and scrapers.</p>
                            <p>It has been found necessary to erect temporary railings along the roadways which are to be constructed on the bluff tract in order to keep people and teams from running over the grounds.  A ton of blue grass seed has been sowed on this tract and the numerous paths and roads formed by people who wish to walk about the tract threaten to destroy the seed.  In order to confine the people and teams to the places which are to be turned into roadways as soon as that part of the work is reached posts have been set along these future roadways and heavy wire stretched to form temporary fences.</p>

                            <p>The fruits of the visit of Mrs. F. M. Ford, secretary of the Woman's Board of Managers of the exposition, to Nashville, continue to multiply.

She not only accomplished this but has landed two other conventions and the returns are not all in yet.</p>
                            <p>The latest news is that the National Household Economic association will meet in Omaha some time during October, 1898.  This is regarded as one of the most important of the many national bodies which have to do with matters relating to the sphere of women.  Its meetings are usually attended by 300 or 400 delegates from all parts of the country and the women in all parts of the country who are most prominent in all matters connected with the advancement of

                            woman and the investigation of questions in which the gentler sex are mainly interested are members of it.  The scope of this organization is quite broad, everything connected with the household coming within its jurisdiction.  It discusses household sanitation, the proper preparation of food, the servant girl question, the proper care of children and the thousand and one questions pertaining to the duties of the home.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Mary Green of Charlotte, Mich., is president of the national association; Mrs. John Wilkinson of Chicago is honorary president and Mrs. Ellen M. Henrotin of Chicago is honorary vice president.  A state society exists in Nebraska of which Mrs. Mary M. Pugh of this city is president.</p>
                            <p>The meetings of the society are held semi-annually, in October and April.  The meeting to be held next spring, in Chicago, will finally fix the place for the October meeting, but a resolution was passed at the Nashville meeting endorsed Omaha as the place for the October meeting and the secretary of the association writes to Mrs. Ford to say that there is no doubt but that the spring meeting will carry out the intent of this resolution.</p>

There will be two of these bridges, extending from the bank to the island, each having a fifty-foot roadway, and constructed so that they will answer for wagon bridges in Kountze park after the exposition is closed.  The railing of these bridges will be of dainty, ornamental iron work, giving a light and airy appearance, while concealing great strength.  The center of the trusses underneath the bridges will be eight feet above the surface of the water when the lagoon is filled to the proper point.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Exhibits is in receipt of inquiries from the bee keepers of Wisconsin regarding the rules governing exhibits of bees and honey.</p>
                            <p>Governor Bloxham of Florida has appointed the following commission to see that Florida is properly represented at the Transmississippi and International Exposition: W. W. K. Decker, Tarpon Springs; M. R. Marks, Orlando; S. Boteler Thompson, Lake City, and John D. Peabody, Ozona.</p>
                            <p>The secretary of the Lumber exchange of Seattle, Wash., writes to the Department of Exhibits that the details of the lumber exhibit to be made under the direction of the exchange, showing that the lumber resources of the Pacific coast, will be arranged at the next meeting of the exchange.</p>
                            <p>The Wisconsin Exposition commission is organizing the business men of the various cities and towns in the state into an association for making displays of the state's resources at the exposition.  A meeting for this purpose was held at Racine Saturday night of last week and an organization perfected.</p>
                            <p>The Nashville, Tenn., papers are suggesting that Tennessee be represented at the Transmississippi Exposition by a state building, and it is suggested that the Hermitage, the historic home of "Old Hickory," be reproduced as typical of Tennessee.  The Nashville American urges the carrying out of this suggestion and advises the collecting of subscriptions among the people of the state for this purpose.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner E. Whitcomb, who has charge of the bee and honey section of the Department of Exhibits, will attend the meeting of the Northwestern Beekeepers' association, to be held in Chicago, November 10, and will endeavor to have the next meeting of the association held in Omaha.  This association is one of the most important organizations of bee keepers in the Unites States.</p>
                            <p>Colorado is making preparations for having a magnificent horticultural display at the exposition.  The annual meeting of the State Horticultural society will be held at Denver November 16, 17 and 18, and a part of the program includes the making of definite arrangements for this display.  As now contemplated a very large shipment of fresh fruit will be made by shipping the stock in refrigerator boxes as is needed.  By this means the display will be kept fresh and the Centennial state promises to open the eyes of the people who have not kept posted on the horticultural resources of the state.</p>

                            <p>Friday of this week will be a rally day in the public schools for the collection of subscriptions to stock in the Girls' and Boys' building, which will be erected on the exposition grounds for the convenience and comfort of the children who visit the show.  This building will be a very pretty little structure, furnished with rooms for the children, both big and little, and with a restaurant where they may have their luncheons.  At the rear of the building will be sand piles and a shallow pond, where the little tots may paddle to their hearts' content.  A model nursery and a creche will furnish the mothers with a place where they may have their little ones taken care of while they inspect the exhibits in other parts of the grounds.  The building will stand at the northeast corner of the main court, near Sherman avenue and Manderson street, being about as near the center of the exposition grounds as any spot that could be found.</p>
                            <p>It is proposed to expend about $5,000 in the erection of this building and the children of the schools all over the state of Nebraska are being asked to contribute to the building fund.  The shares of stock are fixed at 5 cents each, and a contribution of 5 cents makes the contributor a stockholder in the building and entitled to use it.  All who subscribe for twenty shares will be furnished with a handsome certificate of stock, suitable for framing.  The various members of the Woman's Board of Managers have commenced active campaigns in their respective districts and in some of them a considerable sum has been raised among the school children.  The campaign in Omaha has been under way for about three weeks, a committee of the managers having visited the schools and explained the scheme to the children.  Friday of this week has been set aside as the day when all the children will be asked to bring their contributions to their schools and turn the money over to the teachers.  The latter will make lists of the subscribers and the amount of their subscriptions and a receipt for each pupil will be sent out from the office of the secretary of the Women's board.  Those entitled to a certificate of stock will also receive the same from the secretary.</p>
                            <p>In order to have a general supervision over the matter the Woman's board appointed a committee of patronesses who will visit the schools assigned to them and give any additional explanation that may be required.  A partial list of these patronesses was published in The Sunday Bee and three more women have been added since that time.  Mrs. De Graff has been assigned to the Windsor school, Mrs. J. F. Hertzmann to the Cass and Mrs. C. F. Johannes to the Davenport school.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Strike is Now Ordered on the Machinery Building.</head>
                            <p>The carpenters working on the Machinery building at the exposition grounds struck at noon yesterday because Contractor Hamilton would not concede their demand that the eight-hour day and the union scale of 30 cents per hour should be the standard on that building.  The procedure in this case was the same as in the case of the Manufactures building, for which R. C. Strehlow has the contract, and the Mines and Agriculture buildings, for which Goldie &amp; Sons of Chicago have the contracts.  In these instances the Carpenters' union won its point and these buildings are now being erected by union carpenters.</p>
                            <p>The strike on the Machinery building was called at noon yesterday.  At that time a committee from the Carpenters' union waited on Contractor Hamilton and asked him to adopt the union rules.  He asked the committee to arbitrate the matter and to give him thirty days in which to make his answer.  As this time would carry the matter along until about the time for the completion of the building the committee declined to concede this point and the men were called off.  All the carpenters left the work and the building is at a standstill.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hamilton says he will put on non-union men and will be at work again within a few days.  The strike committee simply smiles and points to the three buildings under union rule, the contractors for which made the very same statements when the workmen on their buildings walked out.  They say that Hamilton Brothers have been working their men ten hours and paying from 20 to 25 cents per hour, and they insist that the workmen employed on the buildings must be paid what they term living wages.</p>
                            <p>Work on the building is at a standstill.  Five men only were working this morning, and the foreman, R. A. Estell, said the strike had come at a most opportune time, as he had intended laying the men off to await the arrival of a delayed car of iron needed on the building.  He said that as soon as the iron arrived he would put on a force of new men and would go ahead as though nothing had happened.  The strike committee of the carpenters, however, smiled knowingly when talking about the matter and expressed the greatest confidence that Contractor Hamilton would concede their demands in due time.</p>

                            <p>The piles and a portion of the lumber for the Auditorium are on the grounds, ready for the commencement of work on this building.  Contractor Credon says he has all his material at hand and is ready to commence work at once, but is waiting for the exposition management to excavate the space which will be underneath the stage and parquet of the building.  A contract for doing this work was authorized by the executive committee at a meeting held at noon today, Manager Kirkendall being instructed to make a construct with Van Court &amp; Winn for the work at 15 cents per yard.</p>
                            <p>There are about 1,500 yards of earth to be moved, the excavation being like a cellar, with sloping banks on three sides, being about seven feet in depth at the deepest point, beneath the end of the building to be occupied by the stage.  As soon as this work is completed the erection of the building will be commenced.  Mr. Credon will use cedar piles under this building.  He says that he prefers to pay a little more for cedar rather than wait a month or more for cottonwood piles, as other contractors have been compelled to do.  The piles are on the ground and he has made a contract with one of the piledrivers to drive them.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Sealing Down the Bids to Get Inside the Appropriation Leaves the Omaha Bidders Out of the Running.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 1.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The contract for the Government building at Omaha has been awarded to George Moore &amp; Sons of Nashville, Tenn., for $43,937.  The awarding of the contract was only accomplished by sealing down the size of the building, three bays on either side being taken off to bring the contract price within the government's appropriation.  At the supervising architect's office it was asserted that the reduction would in no wise injure the symmetry of the building, which would in all particulars be constructed as planned, with the exception of reducing the length of the wings, thereby reducing the floor space.  The reduction of these bays was an alternative proposition in the specifications, and was considered by each intending builder.  When supervising Architect Taylor came to this feature, he very readily saw that none of the Omaha contractors were to be considered, their bids being very much higher than the eastern bidders, consequently the award went to Moore &amp; Sons.  Even as it is, the bid will knock out the life saving station, unless congress comes to the relief next winter by passing a joint resolution appropriating at least $5,000 for the erection of such a station on the lagoon.  While the bid is lower by $6,000 than the sum appropriated by congress, the plaster casts must come out of this balance, also the expenses of Designer Crane, who made a special trip to Omaha to get the lay of the land, and the salary of the inspector.  This will leave about $1,500 for all incidental expenses, a very insignificant sum as viewed by treasury officers.  Bids for the plaster casts were rejected today, it being ascertained that the lowest bid was informal.  Bids will therefore be re-advertised at once.  The award for the construction of the Government building went to Assistant Secretary Spaulding of the Treasury department late this afternoon for his approval, and it is expected it will be bulletined tomorrow.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EXPOSITION MEDALS.</head>
                            <p>The seventh section of the act of June 10, 1896, to authorize and encourage the holding of a Transmississippi and International Exposition at Omaha in 1898, provides, "that medals with appropriate devices, emblems and inscriptions, commemorative of said Transmississippi and International Exposition and of the awards to be made to the exhibitors thereat shall be prepared at some mint of the United States for the Board of Directors thereof, subject to the provisions of the fifty-second section of the coinage act of 1873."</p>
                            <p>It will be remembered that there was a great delay in the delivery of the medals awarded to exhibitors to the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, because of the fact that the design for the medals was not selected until after the close of the exposition, and then again the design approved by the Board of Awards did not meet with the approval of the secretary of the treasury of congress and a new reverse had to be prepared.  Then the number of medals was so great that owing to the limited facilities of the Philadelphia mint a contract had to be made with outside parties for striking the medals and it was not until January, 1896, that the medals were delivered to the Treasury department.</p>
                            <p>In view of these facts, the directors of the Omaha exposition should furnish the design of the medals they desire without delay, otherwise there is danger that they will not be ready for delivery until after the close of the exposition.  The director of the mint is ready to take hold of the matter and push it to active completion as soon as he is furnished with the design adopted.  He is of the opinion that the design of the medal should be something typical of the transmississippi country and at the same time somewhat national in character.  He feels that it should be prepared under the direction of the Board of Managers and approved by it before being forwarded to the department, as after it is once adopted there can be no more changes, as it will take some two or three months to engrave the dies.</p>
                            <p>In all foreign countries when expositions are held the preparation of the medals is commenced long before the opening of the exposition and the medals are ready for delivery before the close of the same.  Medals for the exposition to be held at Paris in 1900 are already in the course of preparation.</p>

                            <p>CHICAGO, Nov. 1.&#8212;Dion Geraldine, formerly a superintendent in the construction department of the World's fair, was married today to Miss Ellen L. Cochran of Chicago.  They will leave this evening for Omaha where they will reside.</p>
                            <p>(Miss Cochran is the young woman who was employed in Geraldine's office from about a month after his connection with the exposition commenced until about two months before that connection ceased.  Previous to her employment Geraldine had no less than eight stenographers in his office, one at a time, and both men and women.  He claimed that none of them could do the work in the manner he wanted it done and finally announced that he would be compelled to send to Chicago to get an expert stenographer who could do the work properly.  She was paid the monthly salary fixed for all typewriter operators by the exposition management, $40 per month, but Geraldine turned in bills for $20 per month for "overtime."  The first one only was allowed.)</p>

                            <p>The water mains on the Kountze tract have been completed with the exception of the connections with the main buildings, and the mains will be tested tomorrow or Friday, so that the trenches may be filled in, as the openings interfere with the workmen employed on the buildings.  The contract requires that the pipes shall be subjected to a pressure of 200 pounds per square inch before being accepted, and this test will be made tomorrow if the apparatus can be secured at that time.  The pipes will be filled with a hose attached to one of the city hydrants and an effort will be made to secure the loan of one of the city fire engines to apply the pressure.</p>
                            <p>The digging of the trenches for the water pipes to supply the bluff tract was commenced this morning.</p>

                            <p>The strike situation on the Machinery building at the exposition grounds has undergone little change during the last twenty-four hours.  Contractor Hamilton put a few more non-union men at work this morning but little work is being done on the building.  The strikers' committee is watching the building and the gates opening into the grounds, and every man who goes to work is talked with in the endeavor to induce him to stay out until the strike is settled.  A conference was held between the strike committee and Contractor Hamilton yesterday, but no conclusion was reached.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Dion Geraldine is again in Omaha acting as if he had never resigned his position as superintendent of the Department of Buildings and Grounds of the Transmississippi Exposition.  Since his return Tuesday he has been almost constantly at the exposition grounds, giving orders to employes and contractors just as if he was still autocrat of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday afternoon Superintendent A. B. Hunt of the Omaha Water company was on the exposition grounds to see how the work of laying the mains was progressing.  Preparations have been making for the last day or two to make a test of the main pipes that the trenches may be filled.  While the Omaha Water company has no connection with the laying of the main it has been the intention of the company to furnish the water that will be needed and lend its assistance in seeing that the exposition interests are protected and a good job secured.  Mr. Hunt was present for this purpose and Geraldine asked him, in a manner which Mr. Hunt describes as very domineering, "When are you going to make this test?"</p>
                            <p>"I expect the test will be made whenever Mr. Kirkendall, Engineer Ralls and myself agree upon it," replied Mr. Hunt in some surprise.</p>
                            <p>"I want it made tomorrow," said Geraldine with a look that was intended to paralyze the party addressed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hunt is not easily paralyzed and he retorted with some warmth that he would like to know how Geraldine was concerned in the matter.</p>
                            <p>"I'll show you what I have got to do with it," replied the late superintendent.  "I serve notice on you right now that this test must be made tomorrow," and with this he walked away to give instructions to Edward Brennan, the man who is in charge of the work for Contractor William Fitch.  He told Brennan how he wanted certain pipes arranged and gave other orders which left no doubt in the minds of the bystanders that he considered that he was reinvested with all the powers and functions of superintendent of the entire exposition.</p>

                            <p>Geraldine returned from Chicago Tuesday morning and before noon was at his old desk in the white cottage on the bluff tract, which is used by the department as headquarters.  He seemed to be performing his old duties.  Manager Kirkendall was in the building at the time and when asked point blank what Geraldine was doing there, replied:</p>
                            <p>"Oh, he is just staying around here.  If he wants to make this his headquarters I am not going to object.  I am not going to throw the man out."</p>
                            <p>"Is he now connected with the exposition in any way, or is he going to resume his old position?" was asked.</p>
                            <p>"O!  Lord, no!" exclaimed Manager Kirkendall, in his most emphatic tones.  "He is not connected with the exposition and is not likely to be.  You see it may take him a few days, don't you know, to get his things together and all that sort of thing, and I am not crowding him.  There is plenty of room here and I don't see any objection to letting him stay around if he wants to."</p>
                            <p>Geraldine's unconditional resignation as superintendent of exposition buildings and grounds was accepted last week, and all his official relation to the exposition ceased forthwith.  To allay suspicion that his resignation was only a makeshift to tide over the election and that he would be reinstated in a short time members of the executive committee each gave their word that nothing of the kind was contemplated or would be attempted.  It is apparent that Geraldine is laboring under a different impression, and it will not be surprising if he makes an effort to break into the exposition again.</p>

                            <p>Manager Kirkendall stated this morning that Geraldine had not been reinstated as Superintendent of the Department of Buildings and would not be put back in any capacity.</p>
                            <p>"I have had several conferences with him since he returned to the city," said Mr. Kirkendall, "and shall probably have several more within the next few days.  I am getting from him a lot of details about the work which he had in his charge and which he knows more about just now than any one else.  I have no idea or intention of putting him on the pay roll in any capacity, but simply want to post up on the detail work of my department, which has heretofore been in his charge.  I asked him to go out on the grounds yesterday and look after the test of the water mains because the contractor proposed to make the test in a different manner from that we had decided upon some time ago.  I knew Geraldine knew more about the matter than any one else because he had made the arrangements and <unclear/> why I had him look after it.  He consented to do it and I think I am really under obligation to him for doing this kind of thing without any pay.  He has been at the office on the grounds getting his papers in shape so I can tell about the detail of the work and he has been at my private office down town a number of times talking over the different matters which belong in my department.  I am simply taking advantage of the fact that he is in town and am getting in close tough with the work of the department.</p>
                            <p>"I have not formed any definite plans regarding the manner in which I shall conduct my department in the future," continued Mr. Kirkendall, "and for the present I shall continue Mr. Ralls in charge of the engineering work and other general work on the grounds and Mr. Tamm will look after the construction of the buildings.  I may change this plan at any time, but have not decided definitely as to just what will be done.  In any event," he reiterated in conclusion, "Geraldine will not be appointed to any position."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Strikers Say They Cannot Honorably Grant the Demands.</head>
                            <p>The striking carpenters on the exposition grounds are still holding out against Hamilton Brothers, but the members of the strike committee are confident of winning the contest.  State Labor Commissioner Sidney J. Kent is on the ground to lend his official assistance in straightening out the trouble, and he called a conference between the strikers and Robert Hamilton on Tuesday.  The situation was gone over carefully, but the strikers say that he demanded concessions that they could not make without doing great injustice to the contractors who are on friendly terms with the carpenters.  For this reason the conference failed to establish any basis for an agreement.</p>
                            <p>The carpenters say that in their settlement with Goldie &amp; Sons they made concessions which they did not previously make with Strehlow, but after the agreement had been signed they notified Strehlow and gave him the same terms they made with Goldie.  They say that they offered everything which would be considered fair and reasonable to secure a settlement with Hamilton Brothers, but that this firm insists on some special favors which cannot be given.</p>
                            <p>E. B. Egan, a member of the strike committee, said last night that the Hamiltons promised that they would abide by the decision reached in the Goldie case.  He said they employed men on the understanding that the wages would be fixed after the settlement of the other strike, but that his has not been done.  Mr. Egan said he could produce witnesses to prove this statement.</p>
                            <p>Contractors on four of the buildings on the grounds have accepted the rules of organized labor, and the strikers anticipate they will have no trouble with W. H. Parish, who has not yet begun active work upon his contract.  They say Parish has always been fair with union men and they will be disappointed if this record shall be broken in his present contract.  Another contractor who expects to begin work next week has notified the carpenter's union to furnish the men he needs and the men point to these facts to prove that their demands are not unreasonable or these contractors would not accede to them.  They say further that Hamilton Brothers signed the agreement made between the contractors and union carpenters several months ago, and that this should be sufficient reason why they should recognize the demands the men are now making.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kent, in talking of the situation last night, said, "The carpenters have asked for nothing which is unfair or unreasonable.  They have made generous concessions to the contractors, and have no desire to abuse any power which their organization may give them.  Mr. Hamilton on the contrary seems to think that he should be given special consideration.  He takes the ground that he had received special concessions in the making of his contract for the building, and that he should be equally favored in his dealings with the workingmen.  But his demands cannot be honorably granted."</p>
                            <p>State Labor Commissioner Kent stated this morning that there had been no change in the situation.  He said Hamilton had given no indication of making any concessions other than had been indicated at the conference with him.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kent will remain in town for several days until the strike has been settled.  He is in consultation with the other contractors on the grounds and expects to secure an agreement with them within a few days.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;There is still hope for the life-saving service to be shown at the Omaha Exposition.

By his calculation there will be $2,500 remaining of

                            the government appropriations, which he hopes to utilize for the purpose of constructing the station that will reflect the life of the service along the Atlantic coast.  Bids for plaster casts will not exceed $2,500 and it is asserted by the Treasury department that the expenses will be entirely within the appropriation of $50,000.</p>
                            <p>A cablegram from the ambassador to Germany says that the country declines to take part officially in the Transmississippi Exposition, but that the minister for agriculture has referred the invitation of the Transmississippi and International Exposition to the several boards of trade of the empire, inviting them to make exhibits, if in their judgment they cared to do so.</p>
                            <p>Hon.

                            <p>The exposition executive committee held a special meeting yesterday afternoon to clear away a lot of routine business before Managers Lindsey, Rosewater and Babcock started for Chicago and other eastern points on exposition business.  Messrs. Lindsey and Rosewater left last evening, and Mr. Babcock will follow a little later.</p>
                            <p>Manager Babcock introduced to the committee H. D. Fisher of Florence, Wis., a member of the Wisconsin exposition commission, who is visiting friends in the city.  Mr. Fisher said he had been out to the grounds and taken a fancy to a spot on the bluff tract just south of the viaduct and near Sherman avenue.  He said that he would recommend to the commission that this spot be chosen as the site for the Wisconsin building.  Mr. Fisher expressed personal interest in the exposition and said the people of his state would unquestionably make a fine showing.  He is a resident of the northern part of the state and is interested in the mining industry.</p>
                            <p>One of the first matters considered by the committee was the recommendation of Manager Rosewater that F. T. Bickford be appointed as an agent of the Promotion, Ways and Means and Exhibits departments.  It was stated that Mr. Bickford is a newspaper man of long experience, having been connected for a number of years with some of the largest eastern journals as managing editor and also as special representative at Washington.  He was a military telegraph operator during the war, was the American commissioner to the Paris exposition, and was connected with the World's fair.  At present Mr. Bickford is connected with the Agricultural department of the government, and it was stated that he would be of great assistance to the exposition in promoting interest in the east as well as in the west, and would also have strong influence in matters to be brought before congress.  The committee endorsed the recommendation of Mr. Rosewater and Mr. Bickford was appointed.</p>

The committee which will go east will investigate this question and make a report upon its return.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater announced to the other members of the committee that at the election Tuesday the people of the Black Hills, S. D., had carried a proposition to issue $3,000 in bonds for making an exhibit at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bruce laid before the committee a letter from the Exchange bank of St. Louis, asking that the bank be reimbursed for $250 paid to William Elliott, the commercial agent for the exposition who forged the name of E. E. Bruce to a check which had been cashed by the St. Louis bank.  The letter was referred to the attorney for the exposition for advice as to the liability of the exposition in the matter.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bruce was authorized to ask for bids and award a contract for the printing of 50,000 diagrams of exhibit spaces in the several exposition buildings.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Reed reported the application of J. H. Griffiths for the concession for a scenic railway to occupy a space 110 by 800 feet, and asked authority to enter into a contract for the concession.  This was granted.</p>

                            <p>Tomorrow will be "Rally day" in the public schools of Omaha for the collection of contributions of subscriptions to the stock in the Girls' and Boys' building to be erected in the main court of the exposition.  All of the children have been asked to subscribe to the stock of this building and the teachers in the schools will collect these subscriptions tomorrow and sent them to Secretary Frances M. <choice><sic>Fordof</sic><corr>Ford of</corr></choice> the Woman's Board of Managers of the exposition, who will send each subscriber a receipt of the money paid.  Those who subscribe $1 or more will, in due time, receive a handsome certificate of stock, containing a sketch of the building, making a handsome ornament suitable for framing.</p>
                            <p>The Woman's board holds out special inducements to the schools subscribing most liberally in proportion to their enrollment and a friendly rivalry has been established between the schools to win in this contest.  Individuals or schools subscribing for 200 shares at 5 cents each will be given a place on the roll of honor, which is to be placed in the building, and it is also proposed, in case the amount realized will warrant it, to decorate the building with handsome pictures which will be distributed, after the exposition, to the schools subscribing the largest amount in proportion to the number of pupils enrolled.</p>
                            <p>These details have been explained in nearly all of the schools of this city by members of the executive committee of the Woman's board who have been visiting the schools for that purpose during the last two weeks, and the result has been that the parents of the children have been approached in all manner of ways to induce the family purse to open wide enough to give out $1 for a stock certificate.  The school teachers have been flooded with these subscriptions, the amounts running all the way from 1 cent to $5.  A large number of $1 subscriptions have been made and the prospect for a good sized collection appears to be promising.  Many of the children could not wait until the day fixed as a "rally day," but turned in their subscriptions at once and Secretary Ford has been busy making out receipts and sending them to subscribers.</p>

                            <p>Owing to the fact that some of the members of the executive committee were assigned to visit more schools than they could conveniently reach in time, the date for making collections in some of the schools has been extended to November 12, one week from tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>The stock certificates have not yet been printed and will not be issued for some time.  The committee wishes to receive designs for these certificates before finally deciding upon the exact form the certificate shall take.  One design has been submitted and two others are promised within a few days.  Others are asked for and competitors will be given until December 1 to make their drawings.  Full particulars as to what is wanted in the way of a design will be furnished by Mrs. Ford upon application at he office in the Paxton block.</p>
                            <p>The schools in the various congressional districts have already commenced to subscribe to stock in the building, the members of the Woman's Board of Managers from the several congressional districts having been laying this matter before the schools since the fall term opened.  Mrs. Giffert, the member of the board from West Point, who was in Omaha yesterday attending the meeting of the executive committee, brought with her a subscription list from the business men and citizens of West Point amounting to $152, the list being headed by Mrs. Giffert with a subscription of $25.  She said the school list is now being made up and would be sent in shortly.</p>
                            <p>Reports are coming in from other points which indicate that a very flattering interest is being taken in this matter all over the state, due to the energetic manner in which the members of the board have brought the project to the attention of the public.  Miss Helen Chase, the member of the board from Papillion, in this congressional district, has sent in a subscription list of pupils in the public schools amounting to $4.60.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Rehlander of Lincoln reports that with the assistance of twelve other women of the capital city she has laid the building scheme before the twenty-six public schools of that city.  She says that if enough money is not raised by subscriptions a public entertainment will be given to enlarge the fund.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the patronesses of Omaha public schools to promote the subscription of stock heretofore made the following appointments are announced: For the Central school, Mrs. F. M. Richardson and Mrs. C. C. Belden; for the Comenius school, Mrs. Fred Brunning; Park schools, Mrs. C. A. Claflin and Mrs. M. O. Maul; Saratoga school, Mrs. George Forbes and Mrs. Fred B.

                            <head type="sub">Commissioners Figure on Expending Proceeds of the Bonds.</head>
                            <p>The county commissioners have entire charge of the expenditure of the proceeds of the $100,000 of exposition bonds which carried at the recent election and will soon hold a meeting for the purpose of arranging plans for the outlay of the money.  The date for this meeting, which will be in committee of the whole, will be fixed at the regular weekly meeting of the board next Saturday morning.  Members of the board have already informally considered the expenditure of the money, but no definite plan of any character has yet been laid.  The general sentiment, however, appears to be opposed to the idea of spending any money in the erection of a county building.  On the other hand it seems to be considered that the best results can be secured by using as much as possible of the money in making agricultural and other exhibits, renting the required space in the buildings to be erected by the exposition association.  If this plan should be adopted, the greater portion of the money will be used in making an agricultural and horticultural display.  A share will be given to the Douglas County Agricultural society to be expended under its direction.  It is believed that a most magnificent agricultural display can be thus secured, one that will eclipse anything else of the kind to be seen at the exposition.  Commissioner Kierstead is the member who is particularly pushing this plan, and he will advocate it in the committee of the whole meeting, which will arrange the plan of expenditure.  He is emphatically opposed to the erection of a county building.  In speaking about the matter today he said:</p>
                            <p>"I believe that the best thing to be done is to rent a space in the Horticulture and Agriculture building and to spend most of the money in making a display.  It would cost too much to build a separate building and the greatest amount that could be set aside for that purpose would be sufficient only for a structure that would be insignificant beside the other buildings on the ground.  If on the other hand the whole amount were to be used in getting up an agricultural and horticultural display, the county would have an exhibition in that line that would surpass any other display."</p>
                            <p>A portion of the money that will be obtained from the sale of the bonds will be devoted to making displays in other lines, but this matter will remain for the meeting of the commissioners to plan.  That meeting will apportion the amount that will be used in getting up the different exhibits.  The agricultural exhibit, however, will be the largest and will use up the greater portion of the money.  It is settled that but a small amount of the money will be spent in the payment of employes.  The republican members of the board are determined that there shall be no waste in the expenditure, but that the people of the county shall receive the fullest benefits from the bonds.</p>

All the principals and teachers of the Omaha schools have already signed the required agreement and this morning the superintendent received word that the entire school forces of Blair and South Omaha had also signed.

Miss Gamble is a teacher in the Dodge school, is a graduate of the Omaha High school and of the training school.

                            <head type="sub">BUILDING OF MACHINERY HALL RESUMED</head>
                            <head type="sub">Strike Situation at the Exposition Grounds Remains Unchanged&#8212;Conference Between Commissioner Kent and Contractors.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>All evidences of a strike on the Machinery building at the exposition grounds have disappeared.  Twenty-five carpenters were at work this morning and the building presented an animated appearance.  Contractor Hamilton stated that a carload of iron which had been delaying the work had arrived and would be unloaded at once.  The large posts which will support the roof trusses were being framed by a force of men, and the bolts in the car in question will be used in these posts.  The delay in receiving the iron has interfered with the erection of the central dome which will form the main entrance of this building and this work will be pushed at the same time that the roof is being put on.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the strike, Mr. Hamilton said that the strike committee had misrepresented somewhat in saying that he was the only contractor on the ground who was standing out against the demands of the carpenters.  He produced a card on which appeared the signature of W. H. Parrish, contractor of the Liberal Arts building, under a statement to the effect that he had no intention of paying carpenters a flat rate of 30 cents per hour or of working eight hours per day on the Liberal Arts building.  Mr. Hamilton said this was a direct contradiction of the statement reported to have been made by the strike committee that Mr. Parrish would agree to the demands.  He also stated that P. J. Creedon, contractor for the Auditorium, had told him that he would not employ a union man if he knew him to be such.</p>
                            <p>"There are some men employed by me who are being paid 30 cents per hour and others who are not getting that much.  Some of the work is of such a character that almost anyone can do it, and there is no money in paying high prices for work that a cheap man can do just as well.  I have an entire new force with the exception of two men, who have been taken back and two or three who did not strike.  I have a better force than before, and will not consider any proposition which would compel me to discharge these men.</p>
                            <p>"I am satisfied," continued Mr. Hamilton, "that if this matter is settled by giving in to the carpenters, that they would soon find something else to strike for.  They think that if they can force the eight-hour rule the surplus labor would be absorbed.  The next thing they would do would be to strike for 40 cents per hour.  I have learned from good authority that some of the leading men among the carpenters have boasted that they would get 60 cents an hour out of the exposition before the work is finished.  I believe that this thing must be met, and I am in favor of bringing it to an issue at once and having it settled."</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">CONFER ON LABOR MATTERS.</head>
                            <p>State Labor Commissioner Kent had an interview yesterday afternoon with Robert Hamilton of the firm of Hamilton Brothers, the contractors who have the carpenter work on the Machinery building at the exposition grounds, and whose men struck early in the week because Hamilton would not follow the example of the other contractors on the grounds and pay carpenters 30 cents per hour and work eight hours per day.</p>
                            <p>The interview between the labor commissioner and the contractor was devoid of result.  After it was over Mr. Kent stated that he had endeavored to have Mr. Hamilton concede what is asked by the men and the latter had advanced several conditions on which he might be induced to give in.  Mr. Kent said that Mr. Hamilton would sign the agreement to pay the union scale of wages and work eight hours, provided the agreement should not take effect until December 1.  Mr. Kent said this was out of the question and Mr. Hamilton stated he might consent to enter an agreement provided he was allowed to pay the men wages running from 20 to 30 cents per hour as he might see fit.</p>
                            <p>This was declared to be out of the question, and Mr. Hamilton remarked that he would lose $200 by the first of next month if he was compelled to pay the full union scale from this time, and he suggested to Mr. Kent that if the labor union would agree to pay him $200 to make good this loss he would sign the agreement.  He suggested that this amount might be obtained from the exposition authorities, but the proposition was rejected with scorn.</p>
                            <p>The labor commissioner next suggested that the whole matter be submitted to arbitration.  To this Hamilton said that if the labor union would prepare the questions to be submitted to arbitration he would then decide whether he would consider the proposition to arbitrate.</p>
                            <p>This ended the interview and there the matter stands.  The strike committee insists that it is right and that all that is asked is that competent men shall be paid living wages.  They say they have not asked any contractor to employ only union men, but have only asked that carpenters be paid 30 cents per hour and that eight hours shall constitute a day's work.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Button Scheme is Discussed and Considered a Good Thing.</head>
                            <p>The Council Bluffs Transmississippi Exposition committee held its regular Thursday evening meeting and luncheon last evening.  A good part of the meeting was devoted to the discussion the meeting was devoted to the discussion of to decide upon the sort of exposition button to be selected.  The committee reported that is had been in conference with Secretary Judson and had been corresponding with the manufacturers of such goods.  They asked that the report not be considered as formal and desired to have more time given them.  They were allowed until November 11 to reach a positive conclusion and make a final report.  Secretary Judson stated that the styles of buttons submitted had not been altogether satisfactory, and that the committee had not been able to secure any figures from the makers of such a button as they wanted.  The design that was most favorably regarded was a bronze medallion showing an Indian head.  The members generally regarded the button scheme as a good one, and Dr. Cleaver was especially enthusiastic in its favor.  Mr. Keys also thought it was a good plan to push the button, and believed that it would result in bringing in several thousand dollars.  A resolution was submitted by Dr. Cleaver and approved declaring it to be the sense of the general committee that the button scheme should be adopted before the committee made its report at the next meeting, and that the buttons should be placed on sale and sold to raise money to build the big wigwam on exposition grounds.  It is very likely that the bronze Indian head will be the design finally adopted.  It is the opinion of the members that enough money can be raised by the sale of the totem of the Pottawattamies to defray the cost of the tepee and pay a large portion of the expense of the proposed exhibit.  On this line General Test presented this resolution, which was laid over until the next meeting:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, Douglas county, Nebraska, has voted to appropriate $100,000 for a county exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition, we believe that Council Bluffs, as the largest city in western Iowa, and Pottawattamie county, the largest county in the state of Iowa, should be fittingly represented with an exhibit in keeping with their respectable standing in this state.</p>
                            <p>Whereas, There are nonresident property holders in this city and county who will derive an equal benefit from the labors of resident property holders, we feel that they should bear an equal portion of the expense.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, In order to have the city and county appropriately represented by a creditable exhibit, that the city council and the county supervisors be requested to grant or arrange for an appropriation of $5,000 each for the city and county for such exhibit, the same to be expended under the charge of this association with proper safeguards, or otherwise as the council and supervisors may determine.  The president, secretary and finance committee of this association, through its chairman, are instructed to bring this matter before the council and board of supervisors without delay.</p>

There were about 125 people in the party, and they traveled in a special car, decorated with banners with flaming letters announcing to the world that the car contained, "Concessions Bound for Omaha," and the determination of the party was shown by a banner with the legend, "Omaha or Bust!"  These people have been in consultation with Manager Reed and Superintendent Burns of the Department of Concessions and have filed their applications for the privileges they desire.  No action has been taken on any of them, but all have been taken under consideration.  Several of the parties represent features which attracted considerable attention at the Nashville exposition.</p>

The day has been designated, at the request of the Woman's Board of Managers of the exposition, as the occasion in which the contributions of the children toward the erection of the Boys' and Girls' building shall be handed in.  A number of handsome prizes have been provided which will be awarded to the schools that make the best showing in the competition.  Any contributions that are not handed in today will not be considered in the competition.  No reports have yet been received in regard to the success of the plan in the schools, but from the interest that has been manifested by the children and their parents it is expected that the aggregate result of the day's contributions will reach a very respectable sum.</p>

                            <p>The walls of the Nebraska building are all up and the workmen have commenced putting on the sheeting.  This work is being done in a more expensive manner than the same work is done on the buildings being erected by the exposition management.  In the latter case eight-inch lumber is used and the boards are placed eight inches apart, leaving open spaces between, and the lath for the plaster forming the coverings of the building are nailed on these strips.  In the Nebraska building the sheeting is placed close together without any intervening space, taking twice the quantity of lumber required by the other method.  It is also stated that strips will be placed over this sheeting and the lath fastened to these strips, necessitating the use of more extra lumber.</p>

Work has been commenced on both ends of the building by the staff workers and a showing has been made.  The time is fast approaching when it will be impossible for the plasterers to work on the plain surfaces on the outside of the building on account of frost and the part of this work remaining unfinished will have to be postponed until spring.  The carpenter work is progressing, the roof being put on the outer portions of the building.  The trusses which will support the central part of the roof have not yet been put up.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Publicity continues to receive letters from United States consuls in European countries, replying to letters from the department asking assistance in promoting the exposition.  A letter from Hugo Donzelmann, consul at Prague, says: "I shall cheerfully do my utmost to induce Bohemian manufacturers to be represented at the exposition in Omaha, and to that end I will see the governor in person, being acquainted with him, and will also urge the manufacturers living in my district, which is the largest one, to organize and send exhibits."  Similar letters have also been received from Albion W. Tourgee, consul at Bordeaux, France; John C. Covert, consul at Lyons, and others.</p>

                            <p>The excavating of the pit for the Auditorium building was commenced this morning.  There are about 15,000 yards of earth to be moved.  A grading machine is being used on the work.</p>
                            <p>The water mains on the Kountze tract were tested yesterday with the pressure from the city mains and found to show but few leaks.  Another test will be made today or tomorrow with additional pressure.</p>
                            <p>The piles for the Liberal Arts building are nearly all driven and the workmen laying the floor are following the pile driver closely.  A good part of the lumber for this building

                            is on the ground and Contractor Parrish says he intends to push the work as soon as the pile drivers get out of the way.</p>
                            <p>The Administration building is being given the finishing touches.  The casings on the doors and windows are being put on and the doors and windows being at hand to be put in position within a short time.  The staffwork is almost completed, only a few minor details remaining to be attended to.</p>
                            <p>The driving of the piles for the Agriculture building is about finished, the pile driver being at work on the small piles along the south front of the building, which will support the colonnade extending along the front.  The floor is almost completed and the work of rearing the superstructure will be commenced early next week.</p>
                            <p>The water in the lagoon is slowly rising.  It has now reached a point about six inches below the level it had reached when the break in the sewer made it necessary to let all the water out.  The bottom is almost entirely covered and within a few days the water will be at the old level.  It is the intention to fill the lagoon as much as possible before freezing weather makes it necessary to stop the flow of water.</p>
                            <p>The sides of the Mines building are being sheeted.  The diagonal sheeting, which serves the double purpose of braces and background on which to hang the staff, is practically completed on the north and south sides and the roof is being put on the galleries.  The main entrance pavilion is being framed and the building is beginning to show its size.  A large quantity of staff has been stored in the building, but none has yet been placed on the outer walls.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Rosewater continues to harp on the Geraldine matter and insists upon impugning the motives of the exposition management.  In his paper on Monday last Mr. Rosewater said:</p>
                            <!--Find proper encoding for this--><p>The rumor set afloat by parties who are opposed to the exposition bonds that Dion Geraldine is to resume his position as superintendent of buildings and grounds is unfounded.  The managers of the exposition are pledged upon honor to entertain no proposition looking to the reinstatement of Geraldine on the exposition pay roll, and our citizens can rest assured that the pledge will not be broken.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday Mr. Rosewater caused to be printed in his paper a story alleging that Mr. Geraldine was out on the exposition grounds and acting as superintendent.  The manager of the department of construction&#8212;Mr. Kirkendall&#8212;stated to a Bee reporter that Mr. Geraldine had gone to the exposition grounds at his (Kirkendall's) request to complete certain details of the work.  Mr. Kirkendall then positively stated that he had no idea of putting Mr. Geraldine on the pay roll in any capacity.  Yet after printing this emphatic statement from Mr. Kirkendall Mr. Rosewater said editorially in last night's Bee:</p>
                            <!--Find proper encoding for this--><p>The people of Omaha will not submit to any jugglery in the Geraldine case.  They accepted the retirement of the exposition autocrat in good faith and they expect to see him permanently divorced from all official relations to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>It would seem that after Mr. Rosewater had obtained from the management a "pledge upon honor" not to reinstate Mr. Geraldine that Mr. Rosewater would not find it necessary to impugn the honor of the managers as he does in last evening's Bee.</p>
                            <p>The exposition is billed to open in June, 1898, and it would seem that the managers of the exposition should put in all their available time in pushing the great project.  This cannot be done successfully if one member of the executive committee is constantly nagging his fellow workers.  If Mr. Rosewater was as great a man as he thinks himself to be he would not consent to work beside men of whose motives he appears to be so suspicious.  The time for child's play has passed.  Every friend of his exposition ought to realize this.  Mr. Rosewater is at the head of a bureau called the department of "publicity and promotion," and yet under his management it might better be labeled the "department of privacy and hindrance."  The exposition ought to be advertised in the east, and yet Mr. Rosewater is devoting so much attention to other departments that he does not appear to be doing any effective work in his own department.</p>
                            <p>The World-Herald believes that the interests of the exposition would be greatly advanced if Rosewater would step down and out and yield his place to a man who would do more work for the exposition and heap less slander upon the exposition management.</p>
                            <p>The patience of the exposition managers is great, and if they are willing to submit to a continuation of Rosewater's insults it would be the business of no one other than themselves were it not for the fact that these constant assaults upon the management by a member of the executive board tend to seriously injure the exposition abroad.</p>
                            <p>There is only one man on earth who, while serving with five other men in the management of a great public project, would persist in insulting his co-workers at every opportunity&#8212;and that man is Rosewater.</p>
                            <p>There are only five men in the world who, while giving their best effort and their valuable time without money and price to a great public project, would submit to a continuation of abuse and insult such as Rosewater has heaped upon his co-workers&#8212;and these are the five members of the exposition executive board.</p>
                            <p>These gentlemen have shown patience until patience has ceased to be a virtue.  They are entitled to relief from Rosewater's insults, and if they do not possess the spirit with which to resent these insults then it would seem to be time for some one to resent the insults for them.</p>

                            <head type="sub">THE GREAT EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <p>A short time ago the World-Herald published an interview had with Colonel William F. Cody concerning the Trans-Mississippi and International exposition.  "I do not believe," asserted the redoubtable Buffalo Bill, "that the people of Omaha and Nebraska realize the immensity of the exposition.  I hear more about it in eastern cities than I do in Omaha.  It is time for the people of Omaha and Nebraska to wake up to the immensity of the undertaking."</p>
                            <p>Colonel Cody has undoubtedly sized the matter up correctly, and to admit the fact and seek to remedy it is the better way.  The Trans-Mississippi exposition is a great project&#8212;greater even now than its projectors imagined that it could be.  It will take but a single visit to the grounds to convince the most skeptical that the scope of the exposition is greater than its most enthusiastic supporters thought a year ago could be.  The fact of the matter is, the exposition has outgrown all expectations, and today the managers are wrestling with the problem of what to do.  If they succeed in doing what should be done they must have the hearty cooperation of a wide-awake and enthusiastic people.  If they must cut the garment according to the cloth now measured out for them they cannot hope to make the exposition the great and lasting benefit that it should be to Nebraska and the west.  The future of Omaha is bound up in the Trans-Mississippi exposition.  Omaha's reputation for enterprise depends upon the manner in which it carries out the project submitted to its keeping by the states of the Trans-Mississippi territory.</p>
                            <p>It is time to wake up to the importance of making the Trans-Mississippi exposition what it can be made by tireless work and unanimous support.  If the exposition shall rise to the full possibilities it means that Omaha's future is assured and that the Trans-Mississippi country will stand forth recognized as the wealth-producing section of this mighty nation.  If the exposition does not rise to its possibilities the future of Omaha, Nebraska and the west will be curtailed in proportion as the exposition falls short.  This is the logic of the situation.  The situation demands the earnest and cordial support of all the people for the exposition.  The time has come when personal considerations and personal prejudices should be laid aside; when conflicting interests must come to a mutual understanding, and when everything should be subordinated to the desire to make the Trans-Mississippi exposition the greatest event in the industrial history of the continent.  It can be made the greatest, but it can only be so made by united effort and tireless, sleepless energy.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Cody's words should burn themselves into the brain of every man who hopes for the best and is willing to work for the best.  A long pull and a strong pull, forward and not backward, will make the exposition a success.  Shall the forward pull be made?  The time has come when this question must be answered.  What is your answer?</p>

                            <head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">PUSH THE EXPOSITION WORK.</hi></head>
                            <p>The Transmississippi Exposition is advertised to open its gates on the first day of June, 1898.  In order that the opening of the gates may find the exposition ready for business the principal buildings should be completed by April 1.  It will take fully two months for the installation of exhibits in their proper places and the adjustment of mechanical appliances required for power and illumination.  It goes without saying that the rigor of the ordinary work, especially with the covering of the buildings with staff.  Manifestly it is essential for the prompt opening of the exposition that the contracts for all buildings not already under way be awarded without further delay and the construction of buildings now under contract be pushed with vigor.</p>
                            <p>The first structure contracted for, the Administration Arch, is, under the conditions of the contract, to be completed on November 12.  This condition will doubtless be fulfilled.  The Manufactures building was to have been completed November 1, but the contractor for the carpenter work, who was to have turned it over to the staff men on October 19, has not yet done his part of the work.  The contractors for the Mines and Mining building are required by the terms of their contract to have the building ready for the staff workers on Wednesday next, but it is doubtful whether they will be able to do so.  The same contractors were to complete the Agriculture building by November 25, but it is problematic whether their agreement will be carried out.</p>
                            <p>While there are penalties provided to indemnify the exposition for loss by failure to complete the work in time, it is not indemnity that the exposition wants, but the buildings.  The enforcement of contracts to the letter as regards time, as well as material and workmanship, is a matter of absolute necessity.  The season so far has been most favorable to the construction work and contractors have no excuse for delay on the score of bad weather.  Neither do the controversies with workingmen furnish any valid excuse, because every contractor has assumed the responsibility of finding a sufficient number of workingmen and keeping on good terms with them until his obligations have been fulfilled.</p>

                            <p>If the exposition makes concessions to any one set of contractors, either in changing plans, substituting inferior material or extending time, all contractors will ask the same privileges and June 1 will come with buildings uncompleted and exhibits shut out for lack of accommodations.</p>

                            <head type="sub">County Clerk Instructed to Invite Proposals for the Purchase of the Exposition Bonds Voted Last Tuesday.</head>
                            <p>The county commissioners this morning took the first steps toward selling the funding and exposition bonds, voted at the late election.  Commissioner Kierstead introduced the following resolution, which was unanimously adopted:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the county clerk be and is hereby instructed to receive bids up to December 1, 1897, for the $180,000 funding bonds and the $100,000 exposition bonds, as authorized by the vote of the people at the election held November 2, 1897.</p>
                            <p>It is believed that by bringing the bonds to the attention of the public at once, plenty of the bids will be received by the date mentioned.  The bonds will thus be disposed of early and the money will be available.  The board did not order the bonds printed since the official canvass of the vote had not yet been reported.</p>
                            <p>The board also failed to set any time for a committee of the whole meeting to lay plans for the expenditure of the exposition appropriation.  This was also delayed on account of the fact that the result of the canvass was not yet made known.  From the figures now available, the official count will show that both propositions carried with a fair sized majority.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Returns Received from the Public Schools of the City Furnish the Woman's Board of Exposition an Agreeable Surprise.</head>
                            <p>A vigorous but friendly rivalry has sprung up among the public schools of the city to see which shall head the list of subscriptions to the stock in the Girls' and Boys' building at the exposition.  This was strongly in evidence this morning in the office of the secretary of the Woman's Board of Managers, when the returns commenced to come in from the schools where "Rally day" was observed yesterday.  Nearly every school in the city requested more time to collect subscriptions and some of them served notice that they were not yet ready to turn in what had been collected and wanted to take further time in order to increase the amount.</p>
                            <p>Some of the schools had not been reached by the women appointed to visit them and explain the plans of the Woman's board regarding a children's building, and these schools did not have a rally yesterday.  The patronesses appointed for these schools will visit them during the coming week and they will have a rally on Friday of next week.</p>
                            <p>An error was made in The Bee yesterday in announcing that no subscriptions for stock in this building would be received after yesterday.  Subscriptions will be gladly received by the Woman's board at any time before the exposition opens, but it is desired that all stock subscriptions be paid in before December 1, in order that plans for the construction of the building may be formulated.</p>
                            <p>The amount raised by some of the larger schools is a surprise to the most sanguine supporters of the scheme.  The principal of one school in a residence district sent word that the pupils in her building had raised a fund of over $200, but wished another week in which to collect more money.  This school did not make any return to Secretary Ford, but will make the report when the school has been thoroughly canvassed.  From another of the large buildings came the report that the patroness appointed for that building had not yet made an appearance and consequently no rally was held.  It was stated that subscriptions had been collected amounting to nearly $200.</p>
                            <p>The manner in which the children are taking hold of this matter is most gratifying to the members of the Woman's board, and they are quite enthusiastic over the proof that the children's building is now assured.</p>
                            <p>Returns are coming in slowly to the secretary and these will be made public as fast as received.  The list of the rooms in each building will be given with the amount each has contributed.  Informal reports from some of the buildings show that the Central school has contributed $160, the Lothrop $120, the Webster $111, the Mason $40, the Cass $36, the Comenius $36.  It is expected that the total from all the schools will reach about $1,500, and this amount will probably be swelled next week by additional subscriptions.  The collection of these subscriptions will be continued until December 1 in the Omaha schools.</p>

                            <p>The St. Louis Southwestern railway, better known as "the Cotton Belt Route," has secured 2,000 feet of space in the Agricultural buildings and will make a comprehensive display of the resources of the country along its lines.  General Passenger and Ticket Agent E. W. Le Baume and International Agent J. St. Koslowsky, have been in the city for several days in consultation with Manager Bruce and Superintendent Hardt of the Department of exhibits regarding the details for this display.  The negotiations were concluded this morning and arrangements made for the space referred to.  Mr. LaBaume says his road will make an exhibit which will remove the erroneous impression that seems to prevail that in the territory traversed by the road little, but cotton can be raised.</p>
                            <p>The St. Louis road passes through the southeastern part of Missouri, through Arkansas in a diagonal direction from northeast to southwest, passing through the center of <choice><sic>thes tate</sic><corr>the state</corr></choice>, and cuts across the northwest corner of Louisiana, having a terminus at Shreveport, and extends into eastern Texas.  Mr. La Baume says the exhibit will contain a complete collection of the various kinds of lumber found in this region, showing the material "in the rough" and also in a finished condition, and will also include every variety of fruit, grain and other agricultural and horticultural products, in proof of the claim that this section of the country is one of the most fertile spots on the continent.</p>
                            <p>In addition to making arrangements for space for an exhibit, Mr. La Baume suggested that the exposition prepare an advertising car, covered with banners announcing the exposition and accompanied by men to distribute literature and talk exposition.  He said his road would gladly haul such a car over all parts of the line without expense to the exposition for transportation.  He also made other generous <choice><sic>concesions</sic><corr>concessions</corr></choice> to the exposition along the same liberal lines.</p>

                            <head type="sub">About One-Fourth of the Schools Report and the Result is Very Gratifying to the Managers.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The first reports of the work accomplished by "Rally Day" at the public schools has been made out and it shows a very gratifying result.  But little more than one-quarter of the schools have reported while the amount of stock subscribed has been $621.36.  This amount from these schools may yet be increased to some extent, while the publication of the subscriptions already made is expected to influence the other schools to try and make a better showing.  Some of the larger schools are among those not yet reported.</p>
                            <p> A vigorous but friendly rivalry has sprung up among the schools of the city to see which shall head the list of subscriptions to the stock in the Girls' and Boys' building at the exposition.  This was strongly in evidence yesterday in the office of the secretary of the Woman's Board of Managers, when the returns commenced to come in from the schools where "Rally day" was observed Friday.  Nearly every school in the city requested more time to collect subscriptions and some of them served notice that they were not yet ready to turn in what had been collected and wanted to take further time in order to increase the amount.</p>
                            <p>Some of the schools had not been reached by the women appointed to visit them and explain the plans of the Woman's board regarding a children's building, and these schools did not have a rally Friday.  The patronesses appointed for these schools will visit them during the coming week and they will have a rally on Friday of this week.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SUBSCRIPTIONS RECEIVED ANY TIME.</head>
                            <p>An error was made in The Bee Friday in announcing that no subscriptions for stock in this building would be received after that day.  Subscriptions will be gladly received by the Woman's board at any time before the exposition opens, but it is desired that all stock subscriptions be paid before December 1, in order that plans for the construction of the building may be formulated.</p>
                            <p>The amount raised by some of the larger schools is a surprise to the most sanguine supporters of the scheme.  The principal of one school in a residence district sent word that the pupils in her building had raised a fund of over $200, but wished another week in which to collect more money.  This school did not make any return to Secretary Ford, but will make the report when the school has been thoroughly canvassed.  From another of the large buildings came the report that the patroness appointed for that building had not yet made an appearance and consequently no rally was held.  It was stated that subscriptions had been collected amounting to nearly $200.</p>
                            <p>The manner in which the children are taking hold of this matter is most gratifying to the members of the Woman's board, and they are quite enthusiastic over the proof that the children's building is now assured.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SCHEMES TO RAISE MONEY.</head>
                            <p>All kinds of schemes have been practiced by the school children to accumulate funds to be placed to the credit of their respective rooms.  The most elaborate of any yet made public was that evolved in the minds of some of the pupils of the Central school, being a phonograph entertainment.  One of the boys in the Eighth grade was the possessor of a phonograph and an entertainment was arranged in which this instrument was the principal performer.  Tickets were secured and these were sold for 10 cents each.  A number of active canvassers were soon at work and every person having occasion to pass in the neighborhood was asked to pay tribute to the subscription fund by buying a ticket.  A room in another school held a Band of Mercy entertainment and various devices were practiced to add to the funds.</p>
                            <p>Numerous instances were related by the teachers of the different schools of methods adopted by the little tots to earn money with which to buy stock in the children's building.  All sorts of "odd jobs" were undertaken and many a penny was turned by doing chores about the house.</p>
                            <p>A number of the schools turned in their subscriptions to Secretary Ford yesterday and others retained the entire collection in order to make as good a showing as possible all at one time.  The following is a list of those schools which made their returns yesterday:</p>

                            <p>The traveling men of Omaha have formed an organization designed to secure representation for the profession at the Transmississippi Exposition and to insure a place where members from all sections may rendezvous for matters of business or pleasure while attending the exposition.</p>
                            <p>A permanent organization was effected by the traveling men last night at the Commercial club and officers were elected as follows: Julius Peycke, president; E. S. Streeter, vice president; W. H. Butts, secretary and treasurer; W. A. Stone, M. Meyer, J. L. Houston, M. W. Rayley and J. F. Hommel, executive board.  It was decided that a traveling men's building should be erected on the exposition grounds, the building to cost about $4,000 and to be used as headquarters for all traveling men visiting the exposition.</p>
                            <p>A meeting to perfect further details of the organization and to agree upon methods of carrying the objects of the organization into effect will be held in room No. 413 Bee building, next Saturday evening.</p>

                            <p>The St. Louis Southwestern railway, better known as "the Cotton Belt Route," has secured 2,000 feet of space in the Agriculture building and will make a comprehensive display of the resources of the country along its lines.  General Passenger and Ticket Agent E. W. La Baume and Industrial Agent J. St. Koslowsky, have been in the city for several days in consultation with Manager Bruce and Superintendent Hardt of the Department of Exhibits regarding the details for this display.  The negotiations were concluded yesterday, and arrangements made for the space referred to.  Mr. La Baume says his road will make an exhibit which will remove the erroneous impression that seems to prevail that in the territory traversed by the road but little cotton can be raised.</p>
                            <p>The St. Louis road passes through the southeastern part of Missouri, through Arkansas in a diagonal direction from northeast to southwest, passing through the center of the state, and cuts across the north-</p>

                            <p>J. H. McConnell, superintendent of machinery and motive power, and L. H. Korty, superintendent of telegraph, Union Pacific, left for a trip of inspection over the line Friday afternoon.</p>

                            <p>General Passenger Agent Lomax of the Union Pacific says the outlook for California travel during the coming winter is very good.  He does not believe, however, that the yellow fever plague in the south will divert any great amount of transcontinental travel to the northern lines.</p>
                            <p>An unknown man, severely injured, was picked up on the Union Pacific near Kearney yesterday morning.  One foot had been cut off and he had sustained injuries about his head.  Just when or how he was struck by a train is not known, and an investigation is being made.  He was carried to Kearney and given medical attention.</p>

                            <p>The promoters of the Transmississippi Exposition, and more particularly the people who have contributed to its funds, have a right to demand that its affairs shall be managed honestly and efficiently.  As one of its managers, my acts and the conduct of the department of which I am in control are matters of public concern and should at all times be open to the most searching scrutiny.  For this reason I am not adverse to a free and full discussion and impartial review of the work devolving on the Department of Publicity.</p>
                            <p>Under the caption, "The First Creditable Showing," the World-Herald of last Sunday contained the following editorial:</p>
                            <p>The bird's eye view of the exposition grounds appearing in the latest issue of Harper's Weekly is by far the handsomest and most creditable showing of the great enterprise that has yet been attempted.  The cut covers two pages of that publication, and is of a high degree of artistic merit.  It is a reproduction of the work of Mr. C. Howard Walker of the firm of Walker &amp; Kimball, architects-in-chief of the exposition, and shows all of the buildings and landscaping, with details carefully and elaborately wrought out.  Accompanying the illustration is a three-column article from the pen of Mr. Sylvester Baxter, whose clever word-painting most fittingly accompanies the artist's view.  It is not at all strange that the news stands are already handling their third supply of the issue, as the demand for the picture is general and seems to be increasing.  The thanks of the people of this community are due Messrs. Walker &amp; Kimball for taking up work outside their department and securing such valuable advertising for the exposition in a high-class publication.  It is the first really creditable showing of the exposition, either of an illustrative or descriptive character, that has been made to the outside world, and serves to emphasize what has always been a weak spot in our exposition work.</p>
                            <p>This malicious reflection upon the department of the exposition of which I am manager has been followed up in
                            
                            <pb n="107" xml:id="TMISB03-107"/>
                            
                            my absence from Omaha by other editorials written in the same strain, manifestly not without objects or inspiration.  One of these poisoned arrow missiles fired at the Department of Publicity reiterated the assertion that the exposition management is weak in the lack of proper advertisement and patronizingly ventures the assertion that the great newspapers and magazines would cheerfully devote considerable space to the exposition if they were supplied with matter prepared in an interesting style.  And then a twist is given to the arrow by reiterating that "the birdseye view in Harper's Weekly, inserted through Walker &amp; Kimball, architects-in-chief, attracted attention all over the country and evoked more friendly comment concerning the exposition than all the boiler-plate matter that has been sent out heretofore."</p>
                            <p>It has been my policy never to provoke a fight unless it be in a cause deemed by me to be momentous for the public interest and never to run away from a fight when it is forced upon me.  If in repelling this assault the parties in whose interest it is made and those who have inspired it get the worst of it they must lay the blame to the temerity of their fool friends.</p>
                            <p>First and foremost, there is no such position as architect-in-chief known to or recognized by the exposition and the use of that title is a piece of imposture.  When the exposition was organized for business there was intense feeling among Omaha architects against what was believed to be foreordained by the powers, namely, the selection of Thomas R. Kimball as supervising architect.  To whip the devil around the stump Mr. Kimball was discretely pushed into the background and C. H. Walker of Boston, whose relations to Mr. Kimball were not known to members of the executive board, was, upon recommendation of Mr. Kimball, appointed supervising architect.  Soon thereafter Mr. Kimball assumed the active duties devolving upon his Boston associate, Mr. Walker, but Mr. Kimball was not officially recognized until one week ago last Friday, when a resolution was adopted linking Mr. Kimball's name with that of Mr. Walker.  It was expressly ordered that their title should be that of supervising architects, and not architects-in-chief, as they have advertised themselves on their letterheads and in Harper's Weekly.  As a former member of the executive board, which made this contract with Mr. Walker, G. M. Hitchcock knows that no such title as architect-in-chief was conferred upon anybody.  Nor do I know the object of assuming such title unless it be the shifting upon other shoulders of the responsibility for the supervision of the construction of exposition buildings in strict compliance with plans and specifications.</p>
                            <p>As to the birds-eye view palmed off on Harper's Weekly by Mr. Walker, the less said the better.  Mr. Walker is a clever artist, but the birds-eye sketch made by him in a great hurry last summer was at sight pronounced by me wrong in conception, faulty in execution and therefore unusable for illustrating the exposition.  The foreground, covering nearly one-third of the picture, was taken up with a placard in which the names of the so-called architects-in-chief were more than conspicuous.  In spite of the rejection of this sketch, Mr. Walker requested that it be forwarded to Boston, whence it was placed at the disposal of Harper's without my knowledge or permission.  Instead of being a great advertisement of the exposition, the sketch belittles the enterprise and magnifies the architects.  This is strikingly exemplified by the accompanying write-up, which is devoted not to the exposition as an object lesson to impress upon the world the magnitude of the resources and marvelous progress of the transmississippi region, but to the glorification of the alleged architects-in-chief and all they have done, besides much that they have not done.</p>
                            <p>Compared with the official birds-eye view expressly prepared under my direction by an artist of the first rank, the sketch that appeared in Harper's does injustice to the greatest of American illustrated periodicals and seriously reflects upon the exposition.  Instead of discrediting the Department of Publicity the intermeddling of outsiders with its legitimate function shows the impropriety of letting blacksmiths make watches and shoemakers make horseshoes.</p>
                            <p>The strictures about boiler-plate matter sent out and the insufficiency of advertising in the great newspapers and magazines seem to me an impertinence coming as they do from a man who has squandered a fortune in wrecking a newspaper which in competent hands would have earned for its owner a handsome income.  It is true that up to date no magazine articles about the exposition have appeared, but that fact is chiefly, if not wholly, due to the interference of the same parties that caused the insertion of a second grade sketch in Harpers.  Early last spring, when we were about to negotiate for magazine articles, Mr. Walker made an urgent request that precedence to be given to an article on the exposition which he was preparing for the Century magazine.  This article was to appear in the August Century and it was agreed between myself and Mr. Walker that no other magazine should be supplied with artist's sketches or descriptive articles. August came and then September, October and November and we are still holding back for Mr. Walker's Century sketch.  But we shall delay no longer.</p>
                            <p>In this connection it may not be out of place to note what is well known to G. M. Hitchcock and his blackwash artist, that the Department of Publicity had to wait for months for the architects' perspective drawings and is yet waiting for several.  The pyramid builders 3,000 years ago made bricks without straw, but in these days such a task cannot be imposed.</p>
                            <p>Incidentally I am impelled to recall the rather flattering compliment paid to the efficiency of my department in the following extract from a resolution adopted in October by vote of the Board of Directors, including G. M. Hitchcock:</p>
                            <p>The Department of Publicity and Promotion has accomplished like marvelous results.  Our exposition is the best advertised enterprise of its kind, in the judgment of your committee, since the World's Columbian exposition, even if its widespread notoriety does not exceed that of that exposition in the same period of time.</p>
                            <p>The bombardment of the Department of Publicity is, however, only a prelude to the carefully planned scheme to provoke a bitter controversy which would terminate in my retirement from the board.  The men who are afraid of publicity, for whom the World-Herald is the mouthpiece, may as well understand now as later that they will fail in their attempt.  Notice is also served on them and all whom it may concern that I have not abdicated my right to turn the searchlight of publicity upon every crook and upon every crooked deal.  When my personal and political enemies show such mortal anxiety to have me retire from the inside of the board I feel sure there must be a steal on the outside or a plot on the inside that bodes no good to the exposition.  The man who walks the straight road can never be lost.  The management of the exposition is public property.  The courtesies that are due to my associates will be observed, but the odium of dishonest practices and wastefulness in any department attaches to every member of the executive board and should be the concern of every member.  As one of the managers upon whom devolve the responsibility for making the exposition a success, I know I have a strict duty to perform, from which I shall not shirk.</p>

                            <p>The county commissioner yesterday took the first steps toward selling the funding and exposition bonds, voted at the late election.  Commissioner Kierstead introduced the following resolution, which was unanimously adopted:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the county clerk be and is hereby instructed to receive bids up to December 1, 1897, for the $180,000 funding bonds and the $100,000 exposition bonds, as authorized by the vote of the people at the election held November 2, 1897.</p>
                            <p>It is believed that by bringing the bonds to the attention of the public at once, plenty of bids will be received by the date mentioned.  The bonds will thus be disposed of early and the money will be available.  The board did not order the bonds printed since the official canvass of the vote had not yet been reported.</p>
                            <p>The board also failed to set any time for a committee of the whole meeting to lay plans for the expenditure of the exposition appropriation.  This was also delayed on account of the fact that the result of the canvass was not yet made known.  From the figures now available, the official count will show that both propositions carried with a fair sized majority.</p>

                            <p>The exposition management is weak in one particular and that is in the advertisement&#8212;or rather the lack of advertisement&#8212;of the exposition.  The great newspapers and magazines would cheerfully devote considerable space to the exposition if they were supplied with matter prepared in an interesting style.  They cannot, however, be expected to devote much space to stereotyped descriptions which will neither entertain nor inform their readers.</p>
                            <p>The bird's eye view of the exposition grounds that recently appeared in Harper's Weekly attracted attention all over the country and evoked more friendly comment concerning the exposition than all the boiler plate matter that has been sent out heretofore.  This was the work of Messrs. Walker &amp; Kimball, architects-in-chief of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Less than seven months remain in which to advertise the exposition and no time should be lost in pushing that important branch of the work.  The exposition has a department of transportation, a department of concessions and privileges, a department of exhibits, a department of buildings and grounds and a department of ways and means, all of which are doing effective work.  It ought also to have a department of publicity and promotion.  There can be no more important branch of effort than the proper advertisement of the great project to the people of the world.  Such a department ought to be immediately organized and set in motion.  It is simply ridiculous that so much excellent effort shall be given to the construction of the exposition while no proper effort is being made to present entertaining matter concerning the exposition before the reading in public of the universe.</p>
                            <p>Now that all dissensions in the exposition management appear to have been buried some plan should be adopted whereby the great project of

                            1898 shall be advertised in a manner in keeping with the extensiveness of the enterprise.</p>

                            <p>The resolution offered in the Council Bluffs Exposition association on Thursday night looking to an appropriation of $10,000 to properly represent Council Bluffs and Pottawattamie county in the Trans-Mississippi exposition, is a long step in the right direction.  It will be an investment yielding an immense return.  The largest county in Iowa, and the leading city of Southwestern Iowa, as well as the commercial capital of the fertile "blue grass region" of that state, cannot afford to have an indifferent display of its gardens, vineyards, farms and factories.  Douglas county will be represented by at least $100,000, and Pottawattamie county, as its adjoining neighbor, cannot afford to sink into the shade and permit other Iowa and Nebraska counties to surpass it.</p>
                            <p>From present indications the exposition will excel the World's fair in some of its features. It is the one chance in a lifetime.  The west will be on dress parade.  Millions of visitors will come to view the display, the wealth, the civilization of the Trans-Mississippi states and territories.  The citizens of Council Bluffs and Pottawattamie county are too intelligent and too enterprising not to take advantage of this opportunity by making an exhibit in keeping with their high standing as a progressive community.</p>
                            <p>The amount to be asked for is reasonable.  It is hoped by all the friends of our neighboring city and county that the city council and the county board of supervisors will respond handsomely in granting the appropriation.  If there are any legal difficulties in the way they can be easily removed in the coming sessions of the legislature of Iowa.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater's reply to the World-Herald's criticism of his continued insults to his co-workers on the exposition board is a plain, although awkward, apology for his course in the past.  To be sure, Mr. Rosewater says several mean things concerning the World-Herald, but the World-Herald would be pained to know that it had incurred the good will of the little kicker on the hill top.  It is enough for the World-Herald to know that Mr. Rosewater shows signs of remorse for his malignant assaults upon the exposition managers, which assaults, while being creditable to the assaulted, tend to injure the exposition abroad.</p>
                            <p>This is not the first time that the World-Herald has found it necessary to whip the would-be dictator into his hole, and it is to be hoped that the lessons thus imparted in all kindness, yet with all vigor, will suffice to the close of the exposition of 1898.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The transportation exhibit of the Transmississippi Exposition promises to be one of the most comprehensive illustrations of the progress made in methods of transportation which has been seen in any exposition will be located in a huge building to be erected on the north tract of the exposition grounds.  In this building will be housed the exhibits, showing the various modes of transportation which have been in use in this country since the earliest times.  The various railway lines, especially those in western and southern territory, are making preparations for exhibits of their transportation departments and the indications are flattering for a collection of ancient and modern examples of railway equipment which will make an exhibit of more than passing interest.</p>
                            <p>The Pullman Palace Car company has already signified its intention of exhibiting a full train of its vestibuled cars, showing the latest thing in traveling palaces, and it is conceded that the Wagner company can do no less than follow suit and make a similar showing.  Several of the western roads have indicated a purpose to make displays of passenger and freight cars, and there will be engines galore from the western roads, as well as from the large locomotive works in the east.  In addition to these modern inventions along transportation lines, there will also be displayed the old style methods by which the men and women of the early generations traveled about the country.  In addition to the first locomotive and passenger train there will be the rumbling stage coach which was a common sight in the west within the memory of those now living.  The collection will follow the transportation problem back through the various periods of evolution, back through the era of the wagon and cart back to the most primitive methods in use during the years when the inventive genius of the American had not asserted itself.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SMALLEST RAILWAY TRAIN.</head>
                            <p>In addition to the displays of railway equipment there will be a transportation display of a novel nature. which will be fully as complete, but which will be on a scale suited for the transportation of Lilliputians.  This will be a miniature railway, complete in every detail, with passenger and freight trains, terminals, stations, and all the other requisites which go to make up the complete equipment of a modern railway system.</p>
                            <p>This novelty will be the smallest railway system ever built for the actual carrying of passengers and freight.  The passenger trains will consist of an engine and tender, six observation cars and a box car, the whole train being exactly thirty feet in length.</p>
                            <p>The engines in use on this system will be the smallest locomotive ever built for actual use.  The passenger engines will weigh 300 pounds.  The passenger engines in use on many of the western railways weigh sixty tons.  The cylinder on the diminutive engines will be one and one-half inches in diameter and two and one-half inches in length.  They will have four drive wheels, each eight inches in diameter.  The length of the engine and tender will be six feet, seven and one-half inches.  The engine will carry six gallons of water in the tender and five in the boiler, which will furnish steam for two hours.  The coal for the engine is carried in the tender and the entire equipment is complete in every detail.</p>
                            <p>The engine being so small it is, of course, out of the question for the engineer to ride in the cab, so a flat car is coupled behind the little iron horse and the engineer, who is an old hand at the business, rides on the "gondola" and manages his iron steed by reaching over the tender.  He is engineer and fireman all in one.</p>
                            <p>The observation cars are constructed after the style of those cars in use on eastern roads, being flat cars with canopy tops and having seats for passengers.  Each car will carry four children or two adults.</p>

                            <p>This railway will be operated as a concession on the exposition grounds.  A depot will be erected at some point and diminutive station agents, ticket sellers, baggage smashers, flagmen, switchmen and all the other accessories of a well managed railroad will be on hand to protect the interests of the travelers and the owners of the road.  The train will leave the main terminus at regular intervals, according to the time card, and will haul the passengers along a line which will be an exact fac-simile of one of the most celebrated "scenic routes" in the west.  This feature of the railway will be obtained by means of paintings after the manner of a cyclorama and the grades will be duplicated on a small scale in keeping with the size of the railway.  Bridges, culverts, tunnels and all the other things which go with a mountain railway will be provided in detail, and nothing will be left undone to create the impression of a trip through the mountains.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the other novel features, this railway will have a female superintendent&#8212;the only railway in the world whose operating department is under the control of a woman.  The superintendent will be a woman well known in this vicinity, having been for several years a resident of Council Bluffs.  Mrs. P. J. Fallon will be remembered by residents of Council Bluffs and by many Omaha people.  She has recently resided in Australia and only a short time ago returned from that distant country, with her husband, to take up their residence in Omaha.  She will be in charge of this smallest railway in the world and will have an able corps of assistants.</p>
                            <p>The concessionaires of this railway are Messrs. Norris &amp; Love, the men who are in charge of the ice carnival and who will also have the concession to be known as Cripple Creek.  The construction of this railway will be commenced this winter and will be pushed actively during the early months of spring.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Wong Chin Foo, Chinese commissioner of the Transmississippi Exposition, is in the city making the final arrangements for the exhibit which he proposes to install in a pagoda to be erected on the bluff tract.  He spent the morning in consultation with Superintendent Hardt of the Department of Exhibits and C. F. Beindorff, the architect who has designed the pagoda was agreed upon and it was decided that it should be a two-story building, 62x80 feet in size, with the gracefully sloping roof characteristic of the architecture of the Flowery kingdom.  The tall pavilion which will adorn the building will be filled with a chime of Chinese bells.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Foo is a naturalized citizen of the United States, having come to this country from northern China twenty-four years ago.  He is thoroughly Americanized and imbued with a love for American institutions that is rather unusual in natives of China.  He promises that the Chinese exhibit shall be an instructive lesson to Americans, showing the wonderful resources of the northern districts of China and introducing to the American public a source of supply which has, heretofore, been altogether neglected.  He is most enthusiastic over the outlook for an exhibit and has organized a company, known as the North China Trading and Manufacturing company, and agents are already in the field in China, selecting the people and paraphernalia which will make up the exhibit showing the resources of this part of the world.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <p>"The principal industries of northern China," says Commissioner Foo, "are the making of silk and the growing of tea.  The agricultural resources of the country will be surprising to many Americans and our methods in use in this country.  I shall have a section of the Chinese exhibit showing the manufacture of silk in all its stages, and I shall also illustrate the tea industry by having a huge tank in which will be brewed a kind of tea which has never been imported into this country.  It is superior to anything here in the usual course of trade and possesses properties which are entirely new to tea drinkers in America.  This tea will be given away.  It is quite high in price and the entire crop is usually consumed in China.</p>
                            <p>"In the agricultural section I shall have implements for tilling the soil which will be a revelation to farmers and manufacturers of agricultural implements in this country.  The people of America are very proud of the cereal they call 'Indian corn,' but in my country we cultivated this same corn 2,000 before England was discovered.  We make a great many dishes of corn in various forms which people in this country have never heard of.  We also have methods for preparing other food which are conceded by gourmets to be far superior to the methods practiced by any other nation.  In the various manufacturing lines, the Chinese exhibit will be comprehensive.  We have methods of manufacturing which produces results which have never been reached in this country.  It is true we have no labor-saving machinery, nor do we want any, as our immense population must be kept employed, but the methods of manufacture, which would be utterly impracticable in this country, result in the production of articles of all kinds which are very desirable in America and here, again, the commercial aspect of the matter is presented.</p>
                            <p>"I can assure the people interested in the exposition," said Foo, in conclusion, "that the Chinese exhibit will be one of the most satisfactory of any on the grounds.</p>

No responsibility <choice><sic>wil</sic><corr>will</corr></choice> be assumed by management for exhibits other than watchful care.</p>
                            <p>Invitations have been extended by the national government to all the civilized governments of the world and a reply has been received from Japan indicating a purpose to be present.  It is proposed to organize an International Fishery association at the close of the congress, to hold a session at Paris during the exposition and probably at Omaha during the exposition next year.</p>

This congress is composed of delegates from all the national bodies of women, and is usually attended by 1,000 or 1,500 delegates.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Majorities Overwhelmingly in Favor of the Issues.</head>
                            <p>The county commissioners figure that both the bond propositions submitted at the recent election carried by good majorities.  The men appointed to canvass the returns completed their labors, so far as the bond propositions are concerned, and submitted their figures this afternoon.  With the Sixth precinct of the Ninth ward missing, the result it as follows: For the exposition bonds, 12,081; against, 3,686.  For the refunding bonds, 11,879; against, 3,728.</p>
                            <p>The total vote cast at the recent election aggregated 18,762, of which the commissioners figure 10,512 would be the necessary two-thirds to carry the bond propositions.</p>
                            <p>The books of the Sixth precinct of the Ninth ward have been returned, but they do not show that there were any votes cast for or against the bond proposition.  The judges and clerks of election of this precinct have been sent for that the canvassers may ascertain just what the facts are in the premises.</p>
                            <p>This afternoon the canvassers will complete the work of canvassing the returns on the vote cast for state, county and township officers, but it is certain that there will be little change in the figures as heretofore published in The Bee.</p>

                            <p>There may be no material difference between the title of architect-in-chief and supervising architect so far as printing either title on letterheads or in newspaper illustrations goes.  It may be a harmless habit to wear a brigadier general's star in place of a colonel's eagle, but in the army such habits are not encouraged.  For the exposition, however, the assumption of the title of architects-in-chief in place of supervising architects does constitute a very material difference, as will presently transpire.  A supervising architect is presumed to supervise the construction of the buildings that have been planned under his direction and he is expected to see to it that every structure is built in accordance with the plans and specifications.  This does not necessarily imply that he is to superintend the construction, but it does imply that he is from time to time to inspect the buildings under his supervision and require inspectors of building materials and superintendent of construction to enforce the strict execution of plans and specifications.  The change of title from supervising architect to architect-in-chief would shift the responsibility that attaches to supervision.  Its practical effect would be to open the door for changes in the plans and specifications by building superintendents without the architects' concurrence and without the knowledge of the exposition managers.  It would enable inefficient or dishonest inspectors or superintendents to work into the hands of contractors by accepting inferior materials and permitting defective construction.  This is why the exposition cannot afford to allow a change in the title of supervising architect.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WILL TAKE PART IN THE EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Commission Named by Governor Griggs Enters Actively on the Work of Inducing People to Make Exhibits.</head>
                            <p>New Jersey is the latest state to fall into line in the matter of state representation at the Transmississippi and International Exposition, but the energy with which the commissioners appointed by Governor Griggs are taking up their work promises to atone for any tardiness in getting into the field.</p>
                            <p>The New Jersey commission was appointed October 19, and the first meeting was held in Jersey City November 4, when the commission was organized and an address issued to the people of the state.  The commission as it now stands is as follows: Robert Mitchell Floyd of Jersey City, president; E. C. Hazard of the firm of E. C. Hazard &amp; Co. of Shrewsbury, secretary; Elisha B. Gaddis of the firm of Wilkinson, Gaddis &amp; Co., Newark, treasurer; Eva Henry Williams of the Jersey City Evening Journal; Walter H. Blackwell of the firm of William Dolton &amp; Co., Trenton; Walter Lenox of the Ceramic Art company, Trenton; J. Edwards Barbour of the firm of Barbous Bros. company, Paterson, commissioners.</p>
                            <p>At the first meeting of the commission an address was issued to the manufacturers, producers and merchants of the state asking them to join in a united effort to have the state and its great industrial interests adequately and properly represented "at the greatest exposition ever held in the Mississippi valley exclusive of the World's fair."  The commission says that New Jersey should keep pace with the thirty sister states which have already taken active steps to be represented and hearty co-operation is asked of every representative manufacturer, leading producer and prominent merchant to secure a creditable exhibit of the textile fabrics, leather goods, brass and metal furnishings, cotton, silk and linen threads, wines and distillations, food and agricultural products, tobacco glass, rubber, pianos and other musical instruments, potteries, tiles, vitrified ware, stoves, furnaces, locomotives, etc.</p>
                            <p>This address has been sent all over the state and the report comes from the commission that a strong feeling of interest in the exposition has been manifested on every side and that the state will be represented in a manner which will be a credit to the people of New Jersey and a desirable addition to the exposition.</p>

                            <p>The regular meeting of the Nebraska Exposition will probably not be held until tomorrow as all of the commissioners did not come to Omaha to attend the meeting of the Commercial club Monday night.  The dinner with the executive committee of the exposition at the Millard hotel tonight will prevent the commission holding its business at the time provided by the rules and the business of the board will go over until tomorrow.  Aside from directing the secretary to advertise for bids for the staff work and the roofing of <choice><sic>thes tate</sic><corr>the state</corr></choice> building, there will be little except routine business transacted.  The members of the commission express gratification at the treatment of the Swift Packing company, which has offered to store a large quantity of apples and other fruit which will be collected this fall and kept in cold storage until the close of the exposition.  The liberality of the railroads and express companies in granting free transportation for material for exhibits from all points in the state is also a source of satisfaction to the members of the commission.</p>

                            <p>The Glenwood Apple carnival committee will meet in Glenwood Thursday of this week and Prof. Taylor of the Department of Exhibits of the exposition has been invited to attend the meeting, at which the matter of merging the annual carnival at Glenwood into a grand interstate apple carnival to be held at Omaha during the exposition will be discussed.  This matter was considered at a meeting held in Omaha which was attended by representatives of the horticulturists of a number of the transmississippi states and at which an interstate society was organized for the purpose of carrying out the project.  The people around Glenwood entered heartily into the scheme, and it was suggested by them at that time that they might abandon their usual carnival in order to throw more energy into the Omaha celebration.</p>

                            <p>The interest of the exhibit which will be made by the state of Nebraska to illustrate in a forcible manner the productiveness of this state in sugar will be increased by exhibits from the sunny land of France, where the best sugar beet seeds in the world are propagated.  An application for space for such an exhibit has been received by Prof. F. W. Taylor, superintendent of the bureau of agriculture, horticulture, forestry and irrigation.  The application comes from A. F. Caron of Compiegne, France, one of the largest producers of sugar beet seeds in that country.  The letter of application is rather brief, but enough is said to convert the idea that the exhibit will be a comprehensive one, illustrating the process of propagating the best grade of seed.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Follows the Grecian in General Style, with Many Attractive Features of Interior and Exterior Detail&#8212;Illinois' Home.</head>
                            <p>Plans for the Wisconsin building on the exposition grounds have been approved by the Wisconsin commission and sketches of the building show that the Badger state building will be an ornament to the exposition and a fit companion of the ornate buildings thus far designed for housing the exhibits of the great show.  The design was made by A. C. Clas, one of Milwaukee's most prominent architects and a member of the Wisconsin commission.  It has been approved by the commission and by the governor of Wisconsin and it is announced that President John C. Koch, Secretary W. W. Pollock and Commissioner Clas will visit Omaha soon for the purpose of deciding on a location for the building.</p>
                            <p>This building will fulfill a double purpose&#8212;it will serve as a headquarters for the Wisconsin visitors to the exposition and also as a monument to mark Wisconsin's fiftieth milestone as a member of the union of states.  It is designed along classic lines and instead of following the free lines of the renaissance adopted for the buildings in the main court of the exposition, it adheres in design closely to the more severe but beautiful style of the pure Grecian.  The building is nearly square, and few windows pierce the outer walls, the lighting of the interior being obtained by means of a low dome which is almost concealed from view by a parapet extending entirely around the structure.  The main entrance is marked by four massive Corinthian columns supporting a pediment in which is shown a group of statuary illustrating the progress of Wisconsin.  In the architrave of this pediment is cut the name of the state in Roman letters.  The angles of the building are flanked on both sides by pilasters of the Corinthian order.  A broad terrace extends entirely around the building, and at the rear is located the small circular portion of the structure in which will be housed the exhibit to be made by the Wisconsin Fish commission.  The interior of the building is arranged after the style of the more pretentious Pompeiian buildings.  Spacious rooms are arranged at the front on either side of the entrance and a central vestibule gives entrance to the inner court.  A gallery extends entirely around this court, overlooking a square aquarium with a fountain in the center.  The gallery is supported by massive columns, whose bases rest on the curbing of the aquarium.  Broad promenades are provided beneath the gallery and every convenience is provided for visitors.  Committee and toilet rooms are provided on the second <choice><sic>koor</sic><corr>floor</corr></choice>.  This building is intended solely for headquarters for visitors and officials, and the only exhibit will be that installed by the fish commission.</p>
                            <p>The building designed for Illinois has also been decided on <choice><sic>an</sic><corr>and</corr></choice> plans <choice><sic>apporved</sic><corr>approved</corr></choice>.  The Illinois commission called for competitive drawings and sixteen architects submitted plans.  The drawings of Wilson &amp; Marshall of Chicago were accepted and have been sent to the supervising architects of the exposition for approval.  These drawings show a building in the classic style, 70x136 feet, having a dome, the top of which will be sixty feet from the ground.  A portico supported by <choice><sic>Corinthia ncolumns</sic><corr>Corinthian columns</corr></choice> will form the main entrance.  The feature of the interior will be a rotunda 30x65 feet and an assembly hall and library, with a wide balcony overlooking the first floor.</p>

                            <p>The directory of the Transmississippi Exposition company and the Nebraska commission which has in charge the expenditure of the 100,000 appropriation passed by the last legislature for the assistance of the exposition met together last night at a dinner given by the former at the Millard hotel.  In addition to all the members of the two bodies, there were present two members of the Wisconsin state commission, C. H. Baxter of Lancaster, Wis., and H. D. Fisher of Florence, Wis.  In all seventeen plates were laid.</p>
                            <p>The principal object of the joint meeting was to determine the manner in which the state appropriation was to be used in the assistance of the exposition.  The exposition directory desired particularly to learn at this time just what space the state commission desired to secure for state exhibits in order that it might know what money would thus be available.</p>
                            <p>The conference was a very harmonious one, the commission and the directory being both of the opinion that the exact condition of affairs in this regard should be disclosed as soon as possible.  The special point was to bring out the exact amount that the state commission was willing to expend for space, light and power in order that the directory might figure upon the amount in the management of the exposition.  The Nebraska commission will today hold a meeting for the purpose of settling the figures.  No exact amount was specified in the conference, but the two bodies were apparently in very good accord on the matter.</p>
                            <p>During the course of the conference the members of the Wisconsin commission took occasion to state that they and their companions would be ready to do all in their power to assist the directory in the building of the big show.</p>

The distribution of space to be allotted the several schools was referred to Superintendent Jackson for report.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Boydston reported that he had secured insurance on the state building as instructed at the last meeting and had placed policies with two companies, aggregating $5,000.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Neville and Commissioner Poynter were appointed a special committee to select new quarters for the commission.  They selected rooms at the Millard hotel and their selection was endorsed.</p>

The large trees which are to flank either side of the broad main avenue extending from the grand plaza opposite the main viaduct to the Horticulture building are being transplanted.  These trees are about thirty-five feet in height and have spreading branches, which will make the promenade a shady retreat next summer.  They are being planted in a double row on either side of the avenue and close enough together to form an arch over the walk.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Flowery Kingdom Will Be Represented at Omaha in 1898.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, Nov. 9.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;China will be officially represented at the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held in Omaha next year.  That much has been accomplished through the friendly interest in the exposition by our minister to China, Hon. Charles Denby.  Under date of September 21 Minister Denby transmits to the State department from Peking a communication received the day before from the Tsung Li Yamen, a translation of which says:</p>
                            <p>We would beg to observe that on the 31st day of July last the Yamen received your excellency's note extending an invitation to China to participate in said exposition.  Your excellency also transmitted to the Yamen a copy of a circular relating to this exposition.  The Yamen, at the time, addressed the ministers superintendent of southern and northern trade to take action as in the cases of previous expositions.  We addressed your excellency that the Chinese merchants would be informed that they could send exhibits to Omaha on the same conditions as articles were sent to previous expositions and that there was no need to depute officers to represent China on the occasion referred to.  Now, having received your excellency's further invitation, we beg to say that we will instruct the Chinese minister at Washington, Mr. Wu, to depute officers to represent China at said exposition.</p>
                            <p>Minister Wu said this afternoon that he had received official instructions from his government to appoint a representative to the exposition and that if occasion presented he would in all probability be present in person a part of the time, in view of the fact that he understood the Chinese expected to make large exhibits at Omaha.  He inquired especially as to whether the exposition was of a local or international character and was greatly surprised to learn of the vast extent of territory the exposition contemplated covering.</p>
                            <p>Minister Wu speaks English fluently, is a profound scholar and interested especially in the welfare of his people in this country.  Instead of being interviewed, he became interviewer, asking many questions relative to Omaha, its natural advantages and the country from which it derives its main support.  Minister Wu stated that in view of the exposition not opening until June he had not given a serious thought as to who would be appointed to represent the Flowery Kingdom at Omaha.  It is presumed, however, that the first secretary of the legation, Mr. Shen Tung, will be sent.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Michael, chief clerk of the Department of State and representing that department on the government board at the Omaha exposition, held a meeting of the committee, of which he is chairman, on space and apportionment of funds this afternoon.  The whole subject was gone over, but the division of space was left until a subsequent meeting, the exact floor space not being at hand, owing to the reduction in the size of the Government building.  An apportionment of funds will follow the settlement of space.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Decide to Hold Out for Demands They Have Made.</head>
                            <p>A meeting of the striking carpenters who are holding out for the union schedule of wages which they claim is not being paid them by the exposition contractors was held in Labor temple last night.  Nearly 200 members of local union No. 427 of the Carpenters' and Joiners' Union of America were present.  The meeting passed off quietly and those who were present denied that any general strike had been called, although they hinted that such action might be taken unless the matter was shortly settled.  The meeting was presided over by Robert McKennon with J. H. Tracy as secretary.  A large quantity of routine matters was disposed of, among which was the admittance of twenty-five new members to the union.  The question of the eight-hour schedule at 30 cents per hour was discussed for over an hour.  The arbitration committee reported that it had held several conferences with Hamilton Brothers and also Parish and Creedon, but that no promises had been received from the contractors that the union schedule would be adhered to.  In view of this fact the union decided to fight the issue to the end and in order to do so the committee was strengthened by three members.  It was the opinion, however, of several of the men present last night that the matter would be shortly arbitrated and that the contractors would eventually concede the fight to their men.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WORK ON THE EXPOSITION BUILDING HUMS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Plenty of Material and Men on Hand and Contractors Straining to Take Advantage of the Fine Weather.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Greater activity in construction has been displayed on the exposition grounds this week than at any time since the work of preparation for the great show was started.  Work on all the buildings is apparent on every side.  The vexation delays heretofore cause by failure to get material on the ground seem to have been entirely overcome and the several contractors are taking advantage of the fine weather to push their buildings as fast as possible.  As many men as can be handled are employed on every building and every man is called on to do a full day's work.  If no delays are caused by threatened labor troubles the next thirty days will see the greater portion of the construction completed in the main court.</p>
                            <p>The Manufactures building is booming.  After a long series of delays caused by failure to get material from the lumber men Contractor Strehlow is making fine progress and the roof of the building is now going on.  The huge trusses which span the wide space between the tall posts forming the inside support of the galleries are being placed in position.  The trusses are framed and ready to be raised to their resting places, which work will occupy several days.  The carpenter work then remaining to be done before the building will be entirely under roof will be completed within a short time.</p>
                            <p>The staff work on this building is crowding the carpenters.  The interior of the main dome has been completed and the scaffolding which has prevented a view of the handsome ornamentation, is being removed.  The plasterers are working on the walls of the galleries, and the east wall and a portion of the south wall are covered with one coat of plaster.  Several gangs of lathers and plasterers are work in these galleries, and the entire interior will be covered within a few days.  The staff on the outside of the building is being put on rapidly, and several men are at work "pointing up" the work, filling the joints with plaster so that the walls and columns present an unbroken surface.  Several gangs of plasterers are covering the plain surfaces on the outside of the building, and the indications are that the staff work will be completed by the time the roof is on the building.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">WORK ON OTHER BUILDINGS.</head>
                            <p>On the other buildings good progress is being made and every advantage is being taken of the pleasant weather.  The Mines building will be ready for the staff workers within a short time, but none of the other buildings are far enough advanced to this part of the construction.</p>
                            <p>The piles for the Art building are being driven and those for the east section of this building are nearly all in the ground.</p>
                            <p>The Government building will be commenced very shortly.  The carpenter and staff contractors are in the city making arrangements for commencing work, and they will start on the building just as soon as the material can be obtained.  The contract for this building went to George Moore &amp; Sons of Nashville, Tenn., and the staff contract was sublet by them to a man named Alexander of Memphis, Tenn.  These parties had the contract for the government building at the Nashville exposition and it is said that they completed it in a very satisfactory manner.  George Moore, one of the firm, and Mr. Alexander, the staff contractor, are in the city and are making their arrangements to start work as soon as possible.  They say they will take every possible advantage of the fine weather and will have the building under roof by the latter part of January unless presented by severe weather.</p>
                            <p>The government officials are anxious to have the building under cover as soon as possible so that the exhibits now at Nashville can be shipped here as soon as possible and for this reason the contractor is being pushed to complete the building as soon as circumstances will allow.</p>

The room on the main floor formerly occupied by the Republican State league is to be the new office, and the belongings of the commission have been placed in the new quarters and the attaches are at home to callers.  The change was made because the old quarters could not be heated without considerable expense, and heat is supplied in the new location without any more expense than was paid for rent in the old place.</p>
                            <p>The statement of the bookkeeper of the state commission shows that on November 1 the state fund of $100,000 had been reduced by $10,834.59, leaving a balance of $89,165.41.  The expenditures were composed of the following items: Salaries of officers and employes, $1,696.98; furniture and fixtures, $159.54; office supplies, $265.65; construction, $4,398.55; agricultural exhibit, $593.38; <choice><sic>apairy</sic><corr>apiary</corr></choice> exhibit, $56.77; poultry exhibit, $21.15; live stock exhibit, $32.32; postage, $50; space account, $3,560.25.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska building has been covered with "sheeting" to the cornice line and lathers are engaged in lathing the interior preparatory to plastering.  The trusses for the roof and dome are being framed and the "upper works" of the structure will soon be in evidence.</p>

                            <p>The Illinois Exposition commission has had cuts made of the building which will be erected by Illinois on the bluff tract at the exposition grounds overlooking the river and the bluffs on the Iowa side.  These cuts show that the building will be colonial in style and a very handsome structure, two stories in height, with broad balconies on every side and with a massive central portico extending out from the main front of the building, the roof being supported by tall columns.  The dimensions of the main portion of the building will be 44x166 feet.  Including the porticos and balconies, the building will cover a space 66x136 feet, and the top of the flat dome which rises from the center of the structure will be 115 feet from the ground.  On the main floor will be an assembly hall, 25x36 feet, two stories in height, surrounded by a balcony.  Large official rooms will also be provided on the main floor and also a banquet room, 18x36 feet.  The rotunda will have a mosaic floor with the Illinois coat of arms in the center.  From the rotunda will spring the grand staircase, leading to the second floor, where it is proposed to utilize ornamental and color effects to the best advantage.</p>

                            <p>The controversy precipitated by the attack of the World-Herald upon the Department of Publicity and Promotion has brought to light some matters that were not known up to Wednesday either to the editor of The Bee or to the executive board.</p>
                            <p>While the records of the exposition and the journals of the executive committee disclose no reference whatever to the appointment of an architect or architects-in-chief, but on the contrary made Mr. Walker supervising architect, the firm of Walker &amp; Kimball has in its possession a letter dated last March and signed by the manager of the Department of Buildings and Grounds in which they are styled architects-in-chief.  It is claimed by Mr. Kimball that this title was assumed from the outset by his firm and that they would not have accepted the position of supervising architects for the compensation which was agreed upon with the Board of Managers.  Viewed in this light, Messrs. Kimball &amp; Walker think they have been justified in advertising themselves as architects-in-chief of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The action of Mr. Walker in securing the insertion of his birds-eye view in Harper's Weekly is claiming to have been authorized by the Department of Publicity because in requesting the return of the sketch he had written: "I think I can get Harper's Weekly to publish an article and give some illustrations and if thought proper get them to publish a birds-eye view of the grounds."  He had also asked for sketches for the American Architect of Boston and says he construed the return of the drawing in question to constitute approval of his proposal with reference to Harper's.</p>
                            <p>Neither The Bee nor its editor has any disposition to misrepresent anybody or to do anybody any injustice.  For this reason it cheerfully accords Messrs. Walker &amp; Kimball full publicity of the version presented by them in justification of the course they have pursued both as regards the title under which they are acting in connection with the exposition and the publication in Harper's Weekly of a sketch rejected by the Department of Publicity.</p>

                            <p>DENVER, Colo., Nov. 11.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The local directors of the Transmississippi Exposition held a largely attended meeting last night in the governor's office at which the following resolution was adopted:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That as our secretary is about to visit Omaha in the interest of the Colorado section to secure such space as may be necessary for the different departments, we hereby give him authority to ask the Department of Exhibits in Omaha to reserve for the present the following spaces in the different buildings, to-wit: Horticulture, about 2,000 square feet; Agriculture, about 4,000 square feet; Mines and Mining, about 4,000 square feet; Department of Educational and Liberal Arts, about 3,000 square feet, this to include wall space of 1,000 square feet.  However, as there are no available funds as yet, we hereby instruct our secretary not to make any binding arrangement with the exposition authorities, but, if possible, ask of them to reserve choice locations in the various buildings; also of space to be as the above given figures.</p>
                            <p>The committee depends upon the generosity of the community boards of the fifty-six counties to make appropriations to cover the expense.  An address was issued to the various county boards, impressing upon them the necessity of liberal appropriations in order that Colorado will be as well represented as other western states.</p>
                            <p>A letter from prominent men of Leadville was read stating that Lake county would make a good sized appropriation and would make its mining exhibit the leading feature.  Mrs. Marble's illustrated exhibit of Colorado's resources was indorsed as a good thing to be taken to Omaha by such men as the governor, Senator Teller and Chief Justice Hayt.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Special Committee Appointed to Examine the Conditions and Report What is Necessary to Remedy the Situation.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The board of directors of the Transmississippi Exposition has taken action looking to the appointment of a director general of the exposition.  A special committee consisting of Directors Herman Kountze, I. W. Carpenter, C. F. Manderson, George F. Bidwell and John L. Webster was appointed to consider the advisability of changing the plan of organization of the Exposition association, consulting with the executive committee to learn the views of the managers as to the desirability of creating the office of director general and the duties which should be attached to it and to make a report of findings to a special meeting of the board of directors on Monday afternoon at 4 o'clock.  In case the special committee finds that the creation of the office of director general is advisable it is instructed to also report the changes that should be made in the by-laws and rules to carry the new plan into effect.</p>
                            <p>This was practically the only business transacted by the directors.  When the roll was called there were twenty-six of the fifty directors present.</p>
                            <p>At the request of Manager Lindsey the rules were changed slightly to allow the temporary chairman of the executive committee to sign vouchers in the absence of the chairman.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hitchcock suggested that, in the future, the manager of each department submit to the board at is regular meetings a brief and pointed summary of what had been done in his department and what is proposed to be done, in order that the directors may keep in touch with the work that each department is doing.  This suggestion was put in the form of a motion and was adopted.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles said he would bring up a matter which had been uppermost in his mind for some time and had been discussed informally by a number of the directors&#8212;the question of creating the position of director general.  He said the exposition had reached a critical stage and it appeared that something should be done at once.  He asked that the matter be discussed by the directors.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Kountze was the first to speak on the question.  He said the time before the exposition must open was short and an enormous amount of work remained to be done before the exposition would be ready to allow exhibitors to enter with their goods.  He did not doubt that every head of a department was doing all that was possible for him to do, but all were busy men and had their own affairs to attend to.  A way must be found to get more general push into the thing and see that the contractors do not lose valuable time.  If one force of men cannot push the buildings fast enough a double force should be put on and the work crowded, or the time to open the gates would come and the exposition would be in a terrible fix.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kilpatrick said he had hoped a suggestion in this matter would come from the executive committee; if that committee considered such an office should be created it should recommend such action and should prescribe what powers the members of the committee were willing to turn over to such officer.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kirkendall, manager of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, was called for by Mr. Wharton, who said this department would be affected by the proposed change more than any other.  Mr. Kirkendall said that he was delegating his powers to experts in the several branches of work as fast as this could be arranged.  He expected to go ahead along this line and organize the several departments of work and thus save the expense of a director general, but if it was decided that one should be appointed he would be perfectly willing to turn over all the work of his department to him.  In this connection Mr. Kirkendall suggested that the powers of the president might be enlarged so as to give him authority to consult with the managers of the departments and advise as to what should be done.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kirkendall moved that a committee of three directors be appointed by the chair to consult with the managers of departments and formulate a plan for future work.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kountze asked whether the work is progressing in such a way that there is reasonable assurance that the buildings will be ready in time.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">CONTRACTORS ARE CONFIDENT.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Kirkendall stated that there was no doubt that the buildings would be completed within the time specified in the several contracts, but he said he had consulted with the contractors and they had assured him that they would have the buildings completed in plenty of time.  He said, further, that if he, or some man in his department, had the authority to go ahead and do things that are necessary and that require the expenditure of moderate amounts of money, without running to the executive committee all the time, much time would be saved.</p>
                            <p>Director Youngs said there is a great feeling of unrest among the people of Omaha that the buildings will not be completed on time.  Since Geraldine's connection with the exposition had ceased he said the people felt that some competent man who has the confidence of the people should be placed in full charge of the work on the grounds and given authority to push the work of construction.  He said if this was done the feeling of distrust and unrest would disappear.</p>
                            <p>In reply to questions from Dr. Lee President Wattles explained that the duties of the director general in former expositions had been to carry out the decisions of the executive committee.  The latter decided what was to be done and the director general let the contracts and saw that the work was properly completed.  He also had authority to go into any department and direct the work.  The president remarked that the Transmississippi Exposition was organized on a plan entirely different from that of any former exposition.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater moved to amend Mr. Kirkendall's motion by increasing the committee to five and providing that a report should be made at a special meeting to be held for the purpose at 4 p. m., Monday of next week.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">DEPARTMENTS ALL OVERCROWDED.</head>
                            <p>Regarding the question of a director general Mr. Rosewater said there are now six heads of departments, but none of them devote all of their time to their department.  He said the exposition had reached a critical stage and work must be pushed.  The cold weather is at hand when little work can be done outside and every effort should be made to have the buildings under one roof as soon as possible.  Double shifts of workmen should be employed and the grounds lighted by electric lights in order that the buildings may be advanced as far as possible before cold weather sets in.  Mr. Rosewater reviewed the work of the directors general of former expositions, who were compelled to be on the work at all times.  He said the work of the Department of Buildings and Grounds was enough for any three men and it was a physical impossibility for one man to perform the duties of that department alone.  The same would be true of the Department of Exhibits later on and a man would have to be secured who could give all his time to the position.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lindsey opposed the idea of a director general unless a man could be secured who would do the work without any pay.</p>
                            <p>This suggestion found no supporters and the motion was amended and carried without a dissenting voice.</p>
                            <p>The president appointed as this committee Directors Kountze, Murphy, Manderson, Bidwell and Webster.  It was stated that Mr. Murphy was out of town and would not return for several days.  Mr. Carpenter was then substituted in his stead.  Mr. Kountze and Mr. Bidwell each sought to evade the duties of the committee work by saying that they were very busy and would leave the city on Tuesday, but no excuses were accepted and the meeting adjourned forthwith.</p>

                            <head type="sub">AVAILABLE MATERIAL.</head>
                            <p>The special committee held a meeting last night with the executive committee to take up the question for immediate consideration and advise with the different managers as to their opinion in the matter.  Other meetings will be held today and the committee will present its report to the Board of Directors Monday afternoon.</p>
                            <p>The appointment of a director general for the exposition has been quite generally discussed among the exposition directors and among citizens generally for several weeks.  The general opinion has been that such a change was imperative and this sentiment was voiced at the last meeting of the Board of Directors by General Manderson and Mr. Rosewater.</p>
                            <p>Numerous instances have occurred, especially since the exposition has reached a more advanced stage, where the different departments have clashed somewhat in their work and one has been compelled to trench more or less on the territory of another.  Just where the lines should be drawn which should define the exact territory of each department has been a serious question and it has been evident for some time that this overlapping would become more frequent as the work progressed.</p>
                            <p>In this condition of affairs it was natural that suggestions should be made as to who should be chosen for the position that is generally conceded to be the most important office in connection with the preparatory portion of the exposition.  But one application is on file for this position, that of Major T. S. Clarkson.  Ex-Governor Furnas made application for the position during the earliest stages of the exposition, but when the bill to allow Douglas county to vote bonds was pending in the legislature, and the ex-governor was working hard for the bill, he had it flung in his teeth that he was there from interested motives.  He at once notified the exposition management that his application was withdrawn and it has not been renewed.</p>
                            <p>The names of two men who have not made application for the position have been discussed in connection with the office of director general.  These are W. N. Babcock, manager of the Department of Transportation, and G. W. Wattles, president of the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Bonds Approved and Other Matters of Detail Adjusted.</head>
                            <p>The regular weekly meeting of the executive committee of the exposition was held at the Commercial club rooms yesterday afternoon.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Lindsey announced that he would start for the east early next week to be gone about two weeks, and Manager Bruce was elected to serve as a temporary chairman during Mr. Lindsey's absence.</p>
                            <p>The bond of P. J. Creedon for the carpenter work on the Auditorium building in the sum of $3,500, with the American Surety company as surety, was approved.  The same action was taken on the bond of the Westlake Construction company of St. Louis, contractor for the Art building, with the American Bonding and Trust company of Baltimore as surety.</p>
                            <p>Manager Lindsey reported that he had employed D. G. Rhoads as collector.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall was granted authority to build a sewer on the bluff tract at an estimated cost of $475, the work to be done by day's labor.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kirkendall was also authorized to have sentry boxes made for the watchmen at the gates into the exposition grounds in order to protect the men from the weather.</p>
                            <p>The grading of Twentieth street between the main court and the north tract was authorized and this work will be done by the Department of Buildings and Grounds.</p>
                            <p>At the request of Manager Kirkendall, the salary of John A. Templeton, chief clerk of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, was increased from $75 to $90 per month.</p>
                            <p>Manager Bruce submitted a suggestion made by J. B. Dinsmore, superintendent of the Live Stock bureau, providing that the live stock should be limited to a particular time during the exposition and no attempt made to keep the live stock portion of the exposition running during the entire time the exposition will be open.  Mr. Bruce endorsed this suggestion and also recommended the dates suggested by Superintendent Dinsmore, providing that the poultry section should be kept open from September 19 to October 1, and that the live stock sections, other than the poultry, should be kept open during the month of October, providing that these  dates should be made flexible so as not to interfere with exhibitions of live stock or poultry held at other points, where exhibitors might want to attend both.  The committee approved the recommendations of Mr. Bruce and the dates named were decided upon.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bruce reported that Art Director Griffith would start for Europe in the near future, and would spend eight weeks in visiting the art centers of England, Germany and France, securing desirable works of art for exhibition in the Art building at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Governor Reinhold Sadler of New Mexico recommended the appointment of Colonel H. B. Maxson of Reno to be vice president of the exposition for New Mexico, and the appointment was confirmed.</p>
                            <p>Just before the committee adjourned Manager Rosewater introduced the following resolution, which was adopted:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the following rules be added to the rules of the executive committee: First, no change shall be made in the plans or specifications for any structure for which a contract shall have been awarded unless the same is made with the approval of the executive committee.  Second, no employe of this exposition shall be directly or indirectly interested in any contract or concession made by the exposition, or in any contract for work or material made with contractors or concessionaires with whom the exposition shall have contracts.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Plans for the Great Wigwam Have Been Completed.</head>
                            <p>J. C. &amp; W. Woodward, architects, who were commissioned to make the plans for the erection of the big wigwam Council Bluffs and Pottawattamie county have decided on building on the exposition grounds, completed the plans yesterday and submitted a draft to the members of the executive committee of the Council Bluffs association.  The wash drawing showing the elevation of the great temple of the Pottawattamies has not been completed, but has progressed far enough to show common mortals the size and character and general appearance of what will certainly be one of the most striking objects on the grounds.  The committee has accepted the plans and the preparation of the working plans will be commenced at once.</p>
                            <p>The diameter of the wigwam will be seventy-five feet and the tree top that will adorn its apex will be 100 feet above the surface.  Instead of the three floors as originally decided upon the big tepee will have five floors and will be fully five stories high.  The tree top or boughs that will protrude from the apex will come out through a central orifice that will be used for ventilation purposes.  Immediately beneath the point where these boughs cross will be hung a huge iron pot that will be conspicuous from all points of view.  It will be suggestive of the methods used by the

                            original redmen to prepare the daily meal.  The pot will be filled daily with a compound that will send forth steady volumes of smoke throughout the day that will suggest that the meal is in the process of preparation and that visitors are always expected and welcome.  The outer covering of vulcanized cloth will be given a finishing coat of aluminum bronze paint, which will remain throughout the season a brilliant silvery color.  The letters of the name "Pottawattamie Wigwam" will be of gold and against the silvery background will show brilliantly.  The windows of the unique building will all be in the form of Indian war shields and from the distance will look like huge rawhide targets elaborately fringed with pale-face scalps.  There will be a large number of these windows and the crude Indian ornamentation will run from one to another.  There will be two doorways, and on entering either a visitor will find a modern building, well lighted, ventilated, provided with parlors, reception rooms, closets, cafes and everything deemed necessary, for the convenience of the public.  In the center of the great circle will spring the grand stairway approached from either side, terminating in a large landing or court just beneath the floor of the second story.  This platform will be very large and will form a vantage ground from which the observer can overlook the entire ground floor and see all of the people and the exhibits at a glance.</p>

Rosewater, Esq.&#8212;Dear Sir: We desire to avail ourselves of your office to make public through The Omaha Bee the facts regarding our employment, title, etc., called in question by you in an editorial last Sunday.  Your article read as follows: "First and foremost, there is no such position as architects-in-chief known to or recognized by the exposition, and the use of that title is a piece of imposture."  Our letter of appointment reads as follows:</p>

                                <p>That you knew of the existence of this contract is proved by our letter upon the subject, written you some weeks ago and by your reply to that letter.  Your article further read as follows: "Nor do I know the object of assuming such title unless it be the shifting upon other shoulders of the responsibility for the supervision of the construction, etc."</p>
                                <p>That we "assumed" any title has been disproved.  The only title we have used was conferred upon us in our letter of appointment.  Three weeks before we were appointed architects-in-chief of the exposition Mr. Geraldine was engaged at a salary of $6,000 per year for the express purpose of performing the duties you now state we are trying to shift upon other shoulders.  Mr. Geraldine continued to fill this position and perform these same duties up to within about two weeks of the present time&#8212;a period of nearly eight months.</p>
                                <p>Referring to the bird's-eye drawing your article reads: "It was placed at the disposal of Harper's without my knowledge or permission."  That this is not true is shown by the following letter:</p>

He states that he thinks he can get Harper's Weekly to publish an article and give some illustrations, and, if thought proper, he will get them to publish a bird's-eye view of the grounds.

This is strikingly exemplified by the accompanying writeup, which is devoted not to the exposition as an object lesson to impress upon the world the magnitude of the resources and marvelous progress of the transmississippi region, but to the glorification of the alleged architects-in-chief and all they have done, besides much they have not done."  In the Harper article there is one short paragraph, one-half of which is devoted to our firm.  Whether your remarks are justified can best be ascertained by seeing the Harper drawing and reading the Harper article, which we earnestly hope many of your readers will be sufficiently interested to do.

                                <p>OMAHA, Neb., Nov. 13, 1897.&#8212;Messrs. Walker &amp; Kimball, Omaha.&#8212;Gentlemen: Your letter of November 11 was not handed to me until 3 p. m. yesterday.  Should have responded promptly but for the tremendous pressure of business.  Inasmuch as the points which you raise have been covered by the editorial which appeared on the 11th inst., I do not know whether you desire further ventilation of the controversy by publication of your letter.</p>
                                <p>You assert that I knew of the existence of a contract between yourselves and the exposition as embodied in Mr. Kirkendall's letter of March 22, 1897.  I most emphatically deny any knowledge of such contract.  As a matter of fact you had no legal <choice><sic>ontracts</sic><corr>contracts</corr></choice> as architect-in-chief before November 11, 1897.  The authority granted to Mr. Kirkendall in March, 1897, was embodied in a resolution adopted by the executive committee designating Mr. Walker as supervising architect.  Nobody in the executive committee excepting Mr. Kirkendall had any knowledge of any letter or contract signed by him changing the title.  Months ago, when my attention was first called to the assumption of the title of the architects-in-chief, I made personal inspection of the records and found no change or authority for them.  At various times since then the matter was under discussion before the executive committee and each time Mr. Kirkendall positively assured us that the title was supervising architect.  This fact is fully confirmed by his action two weeks ago, when he introduced a resolution to add the name of Thomas R. Kimball to that of Walker as supervising architects.  At that time his attention was directed to the title and he reaffirmed that it was "supervising architects."  Evidently Mr. Kirkendall had forgotten that he had ever signed the letter in your possession and was not aware of the difference between architect-in-chief and supervising architects when he did sign it.  Otherwise he must have known that he exceeded his authority and that the contract was absolutely void so far as the title was concerned.</p>
                                <p>What I stated as to the shifting of responsibilities is now also confirmed by the position you have taken that your contract did not include such supervision of the construction on the buildings as is usual with architects where a superintendent of construction is employed, either by them or by the owner of the building for which they furnish the plans.  This, in my judgment, is a very essential matter.  It was my belief and understanding that as supervising architects you were exercising the usual supervision in conjunction with the superintendent, whether his name was Geraldine, Tamm or any other.  Now that we know that you do not consider yourselves bound to do so, we want to have it done and are willing to pay for the service.  We must have assurance that the buildings will be constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications accepted by the exposition.  The employment of Mr. Geraldine, or anybody else, could not and should not relieve the architects from the responsibility that attaches.</p>
                                <p>I still insist that the publication of the birdseye in Harper's was without my knowledge or permission.  The letter from Mr. Wattles intimating that such a publication could be secured, may be construed as giving consent, because we forwarded the bird's-eye sketch to Mr. Walker.  As a matter of fact, I did not so regard it.  I directed the return of the sketch because it had never been adopted by this department.  I certainly should not have had it forwarded to Boston had I known that is was to go to Harper's for publication at the very time when another sketch was being prepared by a special artist.  That the Harper sketch does belittle the enterprise is manifest by a comparison between it and the official bird's eye view, which Mr. Walker himself pronounced superb.  Very respectfully,</p>

                            <head type="sub">MR. GRIFFITHS GOES AFTER EXHIBITORS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Will Visit Art Centers and Labor with the Divinely Inspired in Behalf of the Omaha Exposition.</head>
                            <p>In accordance with the action of the executive committee of the exposition at its last meeting Art Director Griffiths will make an extended trip, starting this month, in the interest of the exposition and for the purpose of increasing the already fine exhibit of pictures which has been thus far secured.</p>
                            <p>The art director will go first to Chicago to visit the art exhibit, which will then be open, and will select from this collection the best and most suitable works of art, after which he will go east, visiting Philadelphia, New York and Boston, all of which will have art exhibits in operation, and here the collection for the exposition will be further increased.</p>
                            <p>Following this Mr. Griffiths will go to Europe, visiting the art centers of England, France and Germany, and endeavoring to induce the most prominent artists at those places to send their best work to Omaha for exposition.  In this mission Mr. Griffiths expects to be very materially aided by the movement to create a fund with which to purchase a number of the pictures which will be sent here for exhibition.  A number of prominent men have signified their willingness to pledge themselves to spend a certain amount of money for pictures or other works of art after the exposition is over, and this is expected to exert a powerful influence on artists to send their best work here.  The amounts thus offered vary from $250 to $1,000 and it is expected that a fund of $10,000 will thus be created.  It is said by experts that artists would rather sell a picture than receive any award that might be offered.  The purchase plan has been tried in other expositions and has proved a strong inducement in securing good pictures.</p>

                            <p>At the meeting of the members of the Board of County Commissioners, held this morning the stamp of official approval was placed upon the bond proposition voted upon at the recent election.  This was done by Special Attorney Becket preparing the following resolution, which was introduced by Commissioner Kierstead and unanimously adopted.</p>
                            <p>Whereas, At the general election, held in Douglas county on November 2, 1897, there was submitted to the electors of said county a proposition as to whether the Board of County Commissioners of said county should be authorized to issue and sell the bonds of said county in the sum of $100,000, for the purpose of aiding in the Transmississippi and International Exposition, to be held in Omaha in the year 1898, and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, Said proposition received more than two-thirds of all of the votes cast on said proposition, as shown by the official returns and canvass thereof, and said proposition was duly adopted and the Board of County Commissioners of said county were thereby duly authorized to issue said bonds and sell the same, and apply the proceeds for the purpose aforesaid; now, therefore, be it</p>

                            <p>Resolved, That the proposition authorizing the Board of County Commissioners to issue and sell bonds was duly adopted at said election and said proposition is hereby declared to have been adopted; and be it further,</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the county clerk receive bids for said bonds upon notice, given in the usual manner, until the first day of December, 1897, and that he report said bids to this board, this board reserving the right to reject any and all bids.</p>
                            <p>On the funding bond proposition, submitted at the recent election, the following was introduced by Commissioner Kierstead and adopted by a unanimous vote:</p>

                            <head type="sub">ATTRACTIVE FEATURE OF EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Arrangement for the Affair Placed in Hands of Prof. Taylor&#8212;General Plan for the Great Exhibit.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>A fruit festival, where all varieties of fruits will be distributed with lavish hands and where all comers will be invited to eat their fill of delicious and dainty horticultural products, will form the attraction at the Transmississippi Exposition during an entire week about the latter part of September.  This has been decided upon by the exposition management, and the details of this arrangement are in the hands of Prof. F. W. Taylor, superintendent of the bureau of agriculture, horticulture, forestry and irrigation.</p>
                            <p>Early this summer a meeting was held at the exposition headquarters in this city, which was attended by representatives of the state horticultural societies of a number of the transmississippi states and an organization was perfected for making a prominent feature of the fruit display at the exposition.  Those present entered heartily into the spirit of the scheme and plans have since been maturing.  These plans have been perfected along lines which will result in a number of "carnivals" being rolled into one huge celebration at which fruit will be the great attraction, and each locality where fruit raising is made a specialty will be given an opportunity to the many sections where fruit growing if the chief industry to make a showing, under the most favorable circumstances, of the capabilities of each section.  Apples, peaches, plums, grapes, pears and all the other varieties of fruit will be on every side and visitors from the east, where the impression prevails that no fruit can be grown in the west, will be given an opportunity of sampling the many varieties grown in the transmississippi region.</p>
                            <p>It is virtually decided that this fruit festival shall be held on the bluff tract and the several sections of the country taking part in the event will be assigned locations on the event will be assigned locations on the lower end of the tract.  The decorations will be entirely of fruit, and a gorgeous effect will be produced by the glowing colors of the many varieties of all kinds of fruits.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">LACKS A NAME AT PRESENT.</head>
                            <p>Those having the festival in charge are in some doubt as to the name by which it shall be called.  Three names have been suggested, but none are entirely satisfactory.  These names are: Fruit Festival, Pomological Pow-Wow and Horticultural Holocaust.  Prof. Taylor asks that suggestions in the way of a name for the event be sent to him.  The name proposed when the idea was first discussed was Apple Carnival, but the scope has broadened to include all kinds of fruit and, moreover, the people of Glenwood, Ia., object to the name chosen for their fall festival being thus appropriated.</p>
                            <p>A meeting of the Apple Carnival association of Glenwood, Ia., was held this week and Prof. Taylor was invited to be present and advise with the association regarding its participation in the exposition.  He did so and has returned to Omaha greatly enthused with the possibilities of the affair.  The people of Glenwood announced their intention of making a fine showing during the fruit carnival and asked that 90,000 square feet of open ground be set apart for them on the bluff tract, which they propose to decorate with arches, festoons, booths, columns, statuary, etc., all to be made of apples.  They expect to use several carloads of apples in these decorations, and in addition they say they will have 1,000 bushels of fruit for distribution to visitors.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the display to be made by the Glenwood people and the apple carnival which they will conduct, the fruit growers of Grand Junction, Colo., will hold a peach carnival, at which peaches grown in that section will be lavishly used for decorative purposes and will be distributed without stint to the hungry.  The people in the vicinity of Leavenworth, Kan., will hold their apple carnival on the exposition grounds instead of at home, and many other fruit districts will do likewise.  The Nebraska Horticultural society will not be missing in this event, and the Nebraska fruit growers will make a showing that will open the eyes of all comers to the possibilities of Nebraska soil in the growing of all kinds of fruit.</p>

                            <head type="sub">TALK OF EXPOSITION MATTERS.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Council Bluffs Association Hold Its Regular Weekly Meeting.</head>
                            <p>The regular weekly meeting of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi Exposition association last night was attended by the largest number of the members who have been present at any of the recent gatherings of the association.</p>
                            <p>The question of asking the city and county to make appropriations for the city and county exhibit was talked over at length.  I. M. Treynor brought up the question of the power of the city council and the Board of Supervisors to make such an appropriation.  He doubted if such power existed.  City Attorney Hazelton was present and stated positively that no such power was vested in the city council by the charter of the city.  He believed that the city or county could do so by a special act of the legislature.</p>
                            <p>Senator N. M. Pusey said there was no doubt about the matter, and that neither the city nor the county had such power, but he believed that the legislature could be induced to pass such an act.  He doubted, however, if it could be made to apply to Pottawattamie county only, for such an act would be special legislation.  He believed that it would be much easier to pass such a bill than it would be to get one large appropriation from the state, and he also thought that many of the counties besides this one would be anxious to make individual exhibits.  He promised to use his influence toward getting such an act passed.</p>
                            <p>The discussion of the subject of an appropriation brought up another matter which the association took up.  It was called up by the introduction of this resolution by W. H. Lynchard:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That it is the sense of this committee that the management of the Transmississippi Exposition is pursuing a policy that is antagonistic to the success of the enterprise by insisting upon charging the Iowa commissioners $5,000, or any sum whatever, for a site for the state building proposed to be erected by the Iowa people.  Insistence upon such a charge will, we believe, seriously interfere with the prospect of securing the large appropriation for a state building desired by all.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That we request the exposition management to consider this matter with a view of preventing the exaction of this unpopular charge.</p>
                            <p>It was the first intimation that Senator Pusey had received that the exposition management had decided to make Iowa pay for the ground upon which it was proposed to erect a $35,000 building for the purpose of maintaining a costly exhibit, and he was heartily in favor of the passage of the resolution.  In discussing the matter he made the significant remark that if the management had determined upon such a course he would say without hesitation that it would relieve the Pottawattamie delegation of all future labor in the effort to procure any sort of an appropriation from the legislature.  There were several seconds to the motion to adopt the resolution and it carried without dissent.  At the suggestion of one of the members a committee was appointed to present the resolution to the management and secure a reconsideration of the determination to exact the charge for a building site.  The committee selected consists of Senator Pusey, I. M. Treynor and William Moore.  They were instructed to present the matter to the management at the earliest possible moment and get the favorable reply that is anticipated.  Mr. Treynor stated that Secretary Chase of the Iowa commission had informed him that he had looked up the matter and had discovered that no charge had been made at any of the other expositions for sites for state buildings.  At the Columbian fair Iowa was not only given a free building site, but was given the use of the fine park building without charge.</p>
                            <p>The committee appointed at a previous meeting to decide upon the style of exposition button to be adopted for the purpose of securing money for the erection of the big tepee presented several hundred designs and specimens and introduced a representative of one of the largest emblem button factories in the world.  The task of selecting the most desirable of the lot was too much for the entire executive committee and a special committee, consisting of I. M. Treynor, Dr. Hanchett, William Moore and Secretary Judson, was appointed to conclude the business and to have full power to act in the matter.</p>
                            <p>The committee appointed to look after the work of securing the meeting of the National Educational association at Omaha next year reported through its chairman, Prof. Sawyer, that a large amount of printed matter had been sent out all over the state, and an effort was being made to secure a membership of several thousand among the Iowa teacher, whose influence would all be directed toward bringing the next national meeting to Omaha.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Style of the Official Title of the Architects is Changed.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition held an adjourned meeting yesterday afternoon for the transaction of regular business.  Under the rule adopted Wednesday the meeting was behind closed doors.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater presented a bird's-eye view of the main court of the exposition grounds made by E. J. Austen, the artist who made the official bird's-eye view of the entire grounds.  The drawing shows the main court as seen from an elevated point just east of the Machinery building.  The main buildings and their connecting <choice><sic>colonades</sic><corr>colonnades</corr></choice> are shown on a large scale and the lagoon with its handsome bridges is shown in the middle foreground and distance.  The members of the committee were very favorably impressed with the drawing and Mr. Rosewater was authorized to have the largest size half-tone engravings made from it.  He was also authorized to have pen and ink drawings made of both bird's-eye views for publication in newspapers.</p>
                            <p>At the request of Manager Kirkendall the official title of the firm of Walker &amp; Kimball, the architects who have had charge of the designing of the main buildings, was changed from supervising architects, the capacity in which Mr. Kirkendall was authorized to employ them, to that of architects-in-chief and this will be their official designation hereafter.  Mr. Kirkendall was also authorized, at his request, to open negotiations with Walter &amp; Kimball for their services as supervising architects.  A call for the records of the committee developed that Mr. Kirkendall asked and was granted authority to employ C. H. Walker as supervising architect and that he subsequently reported that he had employed him in such capacity, the record being afterward amended to show that the firm of Walker &amp; Kimball had been so employed.  In support of his request that the official designation of these architects be changed to architects-in-chief, Mr. Kirkendall said he had made a contract with them to act as architects-in-chief and that it had been understood between the architects and himself that they were to have nothing to do with supervising the construction of the buildings.  After discussing the matter the request of Mr. Kirkendall was granted, but the vote was not unanimous.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kirkendall was granted authority to organize a board to have charge of the placing of the insurance on the exposition buildings and to have control of the fire department on the grounds.  He said that this was a matter of great importance which should be placed in the hands of experts.  Fire Chief Redell and Christian Hartman, an insurance expert, had volunteered to serve as members of such board without expense, and he believed that Building Inspector Butler would also serve in the same way.  He was authorized to organize these men into such a board if they would serve.</p>
                            <p>Prof. C. R. Richards of the University of Nebraska will visit makers of stationary engines as the representative of the Department of Buildings and Grounds.</p>
                            <p>Manager Reed was authorized to enter into a contract with George F. Stith of Chicago for a concession to be known as the Afro-American village.  According to the explanation made by Manager Reed this concession will be a reproduction of a typical southern plantation 'before de wah." with all the accessories in the way of genuine plantation negroes in their cabins, with cotton fields, tobacco lands and other characteristic agricultural features, and illustrating the many amusements peculiar to these people by entertainments furnished by the descendants of the most care free and pleasure loving people this country has ever seen.</p>

                            <p>Resolved, That from and after this date all contracts for construction which shall be awarded by the exposition shall provide that the union scale of wages in force on October 1, 1897, shall govern in the payment of skilled labor and that eight hours shall constitute one day's work, providing that extra shifts of eight hours may be used without overtime charge.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That for all skilled labor employed directly by the exposition the union scale of wages and eight-hour day, as provided above, shall prevail.</p>
                            <p>A meeting of the board of directors has been called for 4 o'clock today to ratify this action.</p>
                            <p>These resolutions apply, of course, to future contracts only.  With respect the contracts at present being executed, the situation is not so favorable, though they have passed out of the hands of the exposition.  Recently the job on the manufactures building was made by Contractor Strehlow, a union job, and there is no trouble there, but the other contractors on the grounds are still refusing to grant the demands of the carpenters' union, and the strike method is being used against them.  Yesterday at noon thirty-six out of the thirty-eight men employed on the mines and mining building, Goldie &amp; Sons being the contractors, walked off at the order of the union.  Every carpenter on this building has lately been made, if he did not belong before, a member of the union.</p>
                            <p>Goldie has said that he will be governed by the action of the other contractors largely, and it is thought that Hamilton Bros., who have the contract for the machinery and electricity building, and Parrish, who has the contract for the liberal arts building, will be compliant.  If so, this will settle the whole controversy.</p>
                            <p>Goldie has also said that in order to complete his buildings in the time specified in the contracts he must work more than eight hours per day, but the opinion has been expressed that if he consents to make a union job of his work the exposition management will extend his time.</p>
                            <p>At last night's meeting of Central Labor union and the Building Trades Council the resolutions passed were concurred in.</p>
                            <p>At the meeting of the executive committee a letter was read from Commercial Agent W. W. Pollock of Wisconsin, who desires to run an excursion from Milwaukee to Omaha bearing the members of the Wisconsin commission, the governor of the state, the mayor of Milwaukee and many prominent manufacturers and business men.  The scheme met with much favor, and the matter was referred to the department of transportation for an early approval.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Chief Obstacle to Success Removed, Now Vote for the Bonds.</head>
                            <p>The resignation of Dion Geraldine as superintendent of construction in the Department of Buildings and Grounds was presented to the executive committee of the exposition at its regular meeting yesterday afternoon by Manager Kirkendall and was accepted, thus entirely severing Geraldine's connection with the exposition.  The resignation is to be effective upon its acceptance and became operative at once.</p>
                            <p>With the resignation of Geraldine and the amicable settlement of the wages and hours question, every obstacle to the success of the Transmississippi Exposition has been removed.  A strong pull now together on election day for the bonds is required at the hands of every citizen who takes pride in Omaha and who wishes to see the city roll forward on the highway of progress.  Boys, let us now be as generous as we have been combative, when we were sure we were right.  Let us bury the hatchet.  Omaha is our city&#8212;yours and mine.  Let us unite to make her great.  We can do this by voting for the bonds to assist the exposition.  Shall we do it?  Of course we will.  You and I and all our neighbors shall vote for the bonds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Organized Labor Wins Unconditionally&#8212;Details of This Week's Work on Labor Resolution.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>At the meeting of the exposition directory where Fred M. Youngs moved to dispense with the services of Dion Geraldine, Thomas Hoctor made a motion that all skilled labor employed under future contracts, work only 8 hours per day and be paid the union scale of wages.  The hour being late the resolution was referred to a committee consisting of G. M. Hitchcock, Tom Hoctor and C. S. Montgomery, with instructions to look up possible legal complications.</p>
                            <p>During the week Mr. Hitchcock held a conference in his office.  Hitchcock, Montgomery, Hoctor and Wattles representing the exposition and Messrs. Bell, Youngs, Shrum, Thatcher, Turner, Sturgess, Schlack, Clausen representing organized labor.</p>
                            <p>The proposition made by Mr. Hitchcock, on the advice of Mr. Montgomery, was that the exposition directory would grant the demands of organized labor if it would work and assist in carrying the bonds.  These concessions to be made IF the bonds were carried.</p>
                            <p>This proposal was not satisfactory to the labor representatives, but before the organized bodies had a chance to act upon it, the executive committee of the exposition had cut the strings attached by the wisdom of Mr. Montgomery.</p>
                            <p>When the matter came before the executive committee Mr. Rosewater declared that the IF, inserted, would nullify the bonds, and the resolution, as presented, had better not be passed at all.</p>
                            <p>Montgomery and Hitchcock, both lawyers, disagreed with Rosewater, so John L. Webster and W. J. Connell were called into consultation, and they both confirmed Rosewater's contention, and said the bonds would be worthless with the strings attached.  That settled it.  Then the only thing left for them to do was to cut the string and make an unconditional surrender.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater then wrote and presented the following resolution:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That from and after this date all contracts for construction which shall be awarded by the exposition shall provide that the union scale of wages, herewith attached, in force on October 1, 1897, shall govern in the payment of skilled labor, and that 8 hours shall constitute a days' work; provided, that extra shifts of eight hours may be used without overtime charge.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That for all skilled labor employed directly by the exposition the union scale of wages and eight hour day as provided above shall prevail.</p>
                            <p>These resolutions as presented by Mr. Rosewater were unanimously adopted, with the recommendation that the big directory adopt the same.</p>
                            <p>After this business had been finished Mr. Hitchcock came out o<unclear/> and kindly informed the la<unclear/> waiting that the resolution <unclear/> unanimously, "even Mr. <unclear/> voting for it."  Of course <unclear/>ingmen didn't see anything <unclear/> in a man voting for the a<unclear/> his own resolution.</p>
                            <p>The resolution as passed <unclear/> before the mass labor meeti<unclear/> day night at Labor Te<unclear/> was accepted as a settleme<unclear/> difficulty.  A proclamatio<unclear/>dered printed, which appe<unclear/>other column.</p>

                            <p>To the Laboring Classes of <unclear/> County, Whether Organized <unclear/>organized, Skilled or C<unclear/> Greeting:</p>
                            <p>The members and officers <unclear/> Central Labor union, and the<unclear/>bers and officers of the Omaha <unclear/>ing Trades council at a meetin<unclear/> for the purpose, have authori<unclear/> following statement to be m<unclear/> appeal issued to all classes of <unclear/> Douglas county:</p>
                            <p>In protecting the rights a <unclear/>porting the interests of the <unclear/> classes of this community, th<unclear/>
                            
                            <pb n="117" xml:id="TMISB03-117"/>
                            
                            unions of this city have for some time had differences with the management of the exposition regarding a scale of wages and the hours of work.  These differences have been made public, and from time to time the discussions arising out of them have tended to place organized labor in apparent antagonism to the exposition.  The real facts are, however, that the organized labor has never been antagonistic to the exposition, but only struggling to protect its interests and at the same time the interests of unorganized labor.</p>
                            <p>The first fruits of these efforts resulted in securing from the management of the exposition a resolution that the minimum wages paid for common labor should be $1.50 per day, and the last fruits of these efforts have been the passage of a resolution affording to skilled labor the eight-hour day and union scale of wages.</p>
                            <p>With these differences adjusted, organized labor once more stands in harmony with the management of the management of the exposition.  From the very inception of this greater enterprise organized labor has been its advocate and its supporter.  Even in the times of seeming antagonism it has at heart been true to the exposition project because it has been confident that all classes of this community would reap great and lasting benefits from it.</p>
                            <p>Those expectations have not been disappointed.  Already we see on every hand in this community a rapidly increasing demand for labor.  Already we see a disposition to undertake the new public and private enterprises which must give employment to labor.  And now that the exposition management has conceded for common labor and for skilled labor, for organized labor and for unorganized labor a scale of wages which will enable the laboring classes of Omaha to care for their families in a proper way, we feel confident that the result will be a great improvement in the condition of the laboring classes of this city during the next few years.  The union scale and the eight-hour day upon the exposition grounds mean the union scale and the eight-hour day throughout the city of Omaha and South Omaha.</p>
                            <p>There now only remains one thing lacking to make the exposition all that we have expected it to be and that is the voting of the $100,000 in bonds by Douglas county at the election next Tuesday.  The failure to vote these bonds would mean more than the loss of $100,000 to the laboring interests of this city.  It would mean a black eye to the exposition.  It would mean a cutting down of plans, not only on exposition buildings yet to <choice><sic>bo</sic><corr>be</corr></choice> let, but it would mean the abandonment of numerous private projects dependent upon the exposition and destined to give much employment to the laborer.</p>
                            <p>To defeat the bonds would be to announce to the world that we had no faith in the exposition at home, and that the promised support which it was to receive from the people of Omaha and South Omaha had not materialized.  Such an announcement would greatly reduce the attendance at the exposition and greatly reduce the quantity of money which we hope to be brought to Omaha and left in Omaha by the visiting thousands.</p>
                            <p>We, therefore, appeal to the laboring men of Omaha and South Omaha, organized and unorganized; whether they are engaged in building trades or in other occupations to vote for these bonds at the coming election for the reason that they mean a greater demand for labor and better times for all classes.</p>
                            <p>To those of the laboring class who are taxpayers and who may feel that the voting of these bonds means an increase of taxes we beg to say that it is insignificant; if you pay taxes on a tax valuation of $500, the voting of these bonds will only increase your taxes 22c a year or less than 2c a month.</p>
                            <p>We, therefore, having fought this fight and won this victory in the interests of labor, appeal to those for whom we have fought to ratify our action, to register on Saturday and on Tuesday to give their hearty support to the bond proposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Man for this Most Important Position.</head>
                            <p>If the directors of the Trans-Mississippi will appoint W. N. Babcock as director general, they will take a step which is sure to make the exposition a success, and which will extricate the enterprise from a tangle which may considerably ruin it.  As it is now no concerted action is being taken in the work.  Rosewater wants things done one way, Kirkendall another, Kountze another, and so on through the whole executive committee.  All are able men in their own lines of business but they have no <choice><sic>generel</sic><corr>general</corr></choice> managerial qualifications, and if anyone of them had jealousies would keep them under cover.  Sound judgment would suggest placing the whole work in the hands of one competent manager, giving him full power and unanimous cooperation in his labors.  If a man like Babcock is elected everyone will feel that the exposition will be a success.  Mr. Babcock's brilliant, though sometimes limited management of the yards proves him to be <unclear/> of the best executive officers in the county.  He is a man of varied knowledge of the soundest character, and a power of analysing details and grouping them together in successful way which is felicitously surprising.  His integrity and splendid character can be attacked by no one, and in themselves in such a position would inure to the benefit of the stockholders and the pride of the state.  If the members of the executive committee will drown their individual ambitions to make a success as department managers and adopt a policy which they themselves know should do the exposition the most good they will elect W. N. Babcock director general.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>A relief map of the United States, constructed on a gigantic scale and covering an area of about fifty acres, is the basis suggested by James Mooney of the Ethnological Bureau of the Interior department, on which to show in tangible form the aboriginal condition of the American Indian, as a part of the Indian exhibit of the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mooney has made a close study of the Indian during the last twenty years and is one of the most voluminous writers and thorough investigators of the many scholarly attaches of the Ethnological bureau.  He is the author of the report on the far-famed "ghost dance," which occupies one complete volume of the fourteenth annual report of the bureau and which is a most exhaustive analysis of the sacred religious ceremony which led to the battle of Wounded Knee.  Mr. Mooney passed through Omaha several weeks ago enroute to the southwestern part of the United States to resume his studies among the Indians of that section.  He stopped in the city a few days and manifested great interest in the projected Indian exhibit which has been extensively talked of as one of the prominent features of the exposition of the great states which have been carved out of the hunting grounds of the Indians within the last half-century.</p>
                            <p>During his stay in Omaha Mr. Mooney made several suggestions as to interesting features which would add to the attractiveness and scientific value of the Indian tribes at the time when the first settlers from the Old World landed on the shores of North America and also to show the aboriginal house types of the United States or the peculiar style of dwelling characteristic of each Indian tribe, together with suitable delegations of Indians representing each of the distinctive types.</p>

                            <head type="sub">TRIBES WERE NUMEROUS.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Mooney says that there are about 150 officially recognized Indian tribes gathered on about fifty reservations in the United States and these, with the incorporated remnants of otherwise extinct tribes, make a total of perhaps three times that number, representing the aboriginal occupants of the country from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from the lakes to the gulf.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="118" xml:id="TMISB03-118"/>
                            
                            <p>"Each tribe was a political unit," says Mr. Mooney; "not necessarily different from its immediate neighbors in habit and home lift, although the languages might be dissimilar and the tribes themselves be mutually hostile.  Tribes dependent upon the same geographical conditions differed only in minor particulars.  Those living in the timber region of the east, with abundant rains and fertile soil, built there dwellings of poles and bark as the most convenient material and subsisted as much by agriculture as by the chase.</p>
                            <p>"The Pueblo tribes of the southwest, dwelling in a region almost devoid of timber, water or game, built their houses of stone and kept close to the few springs which enabled them to raise the corn and beans which formed their main subsistence.  Wood being scarce, they made their vessels of clay and developed the art of pottery to a high stage.  Compelled to stay in one place, their architecture assumed a permanent character and, being unwarlike, they took refuge on the mesas to escape their enemies.</p>
                            <p>"The tribes of the plains, depending, with few exceptions, almost entirely upon the buffalo, were compelled to follow it in its migration and were thus debarred from agriculture or the manufacture of such fragile material as pottery.  Forced to move frequently and in light marching order, they developed the skin tepee as the most convenient and portable style of dwelling.  Environment determined arts, customs and models of life.</p>
                            <p>"All the Indians of the United States may be classified into about twenty-five architectural and industrial types, taking the dwelling structure as the tangible base, around which are grouped the household utensils, agricultural belongings and the burial and ceremonial structures."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mooney described briefly and concisely the peculiar type of dwelling characteristic of each of the great types of the American Indian.  These include the "long house" of the famous "Six Nations," or Iroquois of New York and western Pennsylvania, the most powerful federation of Indian tribes within the knowledge of the white man.  The dwelling type of these tribes was thus described: "It was fifty or 100 feet long and consisted of a strong frame of upright poles set in the ground, which were strengthened with horizontal poles attached with withes and surmounted with a triangular, and in some cases with a round roof, covered with bark, tied with strings or splints; interior divided into rooms at intervals of six or eight feet, with bed platforms around inside and open passageway running the whole length of the building."</p>
                            <p>The house type of the Mandans of the upper Missouri is described as a round log structure covered with earth, forty feet in diameter, five feet high at circumference, twelve to fifteen feet high in center, with long covered passageway and interior compartments.</p>
                            <p>The type of dwelling peculiar to each of the grand divisions of the tribes is described, together with the accessories in the way of household utensils, canoes, ceremonial structures, burial customs, etc.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DETAILS OF HIS PLAN.</head>
                            <p>"The very best method of exhibiting in tangible form the several types," said Mr. Mooney, "is by means of a large relief map of the United States, built up by competent engineers and landscape gardeners, on a ground space of perhaps forty or fifty acres, upon which suitable delegations of Indians representing each type, with their appropriate houses, utensils and industrial appliances, burial structures, etc., can be set down in the various portions of the map corresponding to the section of country actually occupied by the tribes themselves.  Each such camp need not occupy more than half an acre on an average, but the relief map would have to be large enough to allow for the proportionate vacant spaces.  The map could be made upon a raised terrace of earth as a basis, with broad, sweeping curves&#8212;ignoring minor indentations&#8212;for the coast lines; with the principal streams, or those particularly necessary, indicated by means of actual streams of water flowing between raised banks also outlined in broad curves.  The general surface should be sown in grass to hold the soil and give a natural appearance, and the mountains can be fashioned in some form of papier mache, or&#8212;as in previous exhibitions for rock work&#8212;of a skeleton of laths covered with sackcloth or canvas and painted with 'mud paint.'  All the elevations, taking only the backbone ranges, should be in due proportion, so that, aside from the use to which it is put, the whole work would be a correct and unique map of our country on a gigantic scale.  The pathways across the mountains and along the streams, to enable the visitors to go about the various camps, should be, as far as possible, along the lines of actual noted trails, such as the Santa Fe trail, the California trail along the North Platte, etc.</p>
                            <p>"In some unoccupied space on the relief map should be a large building of tepee form, to contain collections of Indian weapons, dresses, utensils, ceremonial things, etc., of various tribes, with photographic series and maps showing the distribution of the tribes and languages.  In the same building could be shown the work of Indian schools with other products of Indian civilization, including a Sioux or Cherokee printing press, with newspapers and books printed in Indian languages.  This part of the exhibit might be in charge of civilized Indian students, or better, might be prepared and offered by the five civilized tribes of Indian territory.  These five tribes, having their own independent governments, might properly be invited to make their own exhibit, which, whether much or little, would give the most adequate idea of the capacity and limitations of the civilized Indian when acting alone.  This building of tepee form should be built sufficiently high to have a lookout station at the top, from which might be obtained at a glance a birdseye view of the whole relief map with the various camps.  As Omaha is sufficiently near the center of the United States, this building might appropriately occupy that position on the relief map."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Secretary Brigham Gives the Outline of One Idea of the Agricultural Department Which He Hopes to Carry Out.</head>
                            <p>Hon. J. H. Brigham, assistant secretary of agriculture and chairman of the Board of Control of the Government Building at the Transmississippi Exposition, has written to the Department of Exhibits regarding the sugar beet exhibit which the writer is quite anxious to have form a part of the exhibit to be made by the Agricultural department.  Mr. Brigham writes that Dr. H. W. Wiley, the government chemist, has prepared a plan for such an exhibit which has been submitted to Secretary Wilson for approval.  This plan includes a model beet sugar factory in operation, together with an extensive exhibit showing the beet sugar industry in all its details, forming a most instructive an interesting exhibit.  In order to carry out this plan Mr. Brigham says an additional appropriation will be necessary.  He says a bill will be introduced in congress providing for the necessary appropriation and the exposition management is asked to render all possible assistance in securing the passage of this bill.</p>
                            <p>When the assistant secretary of agriculture passed through Omaha several weeks ago, after attending the irrigation convention at Lincoln, he expressed himself very forcibly as being strongly in favor of making the beet sugar industry a prominent feature of the exhibit to be made by the Agricultural department at the exposition.  He said this was one of the most important industries in this entire section and should be fostered by the government in every possible way.  His letter to the Department of Exhibits indicates that he is working to carry out the idea then expressed.</p>

                            <p>Captain Moretti of the Venetian gondolas at the Nashville exposition is coming here, having secured the gondola concession at the Transmississippi Exposition.  Those who have visited the Tennessee centennial declare that the gondolas there constituted one of the most attractive features of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Captain Moretti and his gondoliers are going to row their boats here through the rivers Cumberland, Ohio, Mississippi and Missouri.  They started from the Cumberland river wharf at Nashville yesterday and expect to arrive in this city on or about December 15.  The gondoliers were busy during the few days preceding the start erecting a small cabin over each one of the gondolas to keep out the rain and wind as much as possible.  The Italians, who are used to sunny climates and balmy weather, do not look forward to their trip through the rivers in the approaching month with much pleasure, but they anticipate that the warmth of their welcome here will more than make up for their chilly trip from Nashville.</p>

                            <p>In 1892 during the celebration at Lincoln of the quarter centennial of Nebraska's statehood an organization was formed of persons born in Nebraska.  Prof. F. W. Taylor was elected president of the organization, but no time was fixed for holding meetings nor was any formal organizations ever perfected.  It was generally understood at the time that the president would call the members together whenever any event of great importance would warrant such action.  President Taylor has decided that the Transmississippi Exposition is of sufficient importance to all the members of the association to warrant the calling of a meeting to consider the matter of representation and participation in the exposition, and for that purpose he will shortly issue a call to all members of the society to meet at a point to be announced later.</p>

                            <p>It is possible that the famous Hahnemann monument, which will be unveiled the latter part of next year in Washington, will be exhibited at the Transmississippi and International Exposition.  Dr. Henry M. Smith, secretary and treasurer of the national association that is erecting the monument, is in the city en route to his home in New York City from California.  Sunday he visited the grounds of the exposition with Dr. Hanchett, and expressed his greatest pleasure at the progress made and suggested securing the large bronze monument of Hahnemann to be displayed at next year's exposition just outside the Art building.</p>
                            <p>The extreme dimensions of the monument are forty-six feet broad by thirty feet deep at the base, and twenty-two feet in height.  Its total cost will be $100,000.  The monument to be displayed in Washington will be built of gray granite, with the statue of Hahnemann and the bas-reliefs of bronze.  The form is that of the Greek exhedra and is elliptical in plan.  Four steps in front lead up to a platform, at the back of which rises the large superstructure.  A sitting statue of Hahnemann, heroic in size, on a granite pedestal, is placed in the central portion, which is composed of four columns.  It is Dr. Smith's idea to get the Gorham Manufacturing company to exhibit here the bronze stature of Hahnemann and the bas-reliefs which they are making, and to substitute for the granite superstructure now being built at Washington a close imitation of staff work of the color and general appearance of granite.</p>

                            <p>To the Board of Directors of the Transmississippi and International Exposition: Gentlemen&#8212;Your special committee, appointed at the meeting of the board held on November 12 to investigate and report upon the question of the appointment of a director general or some other supervising officer, to promote the energetic completion of the arrangements for the exposition, begs to report as follows:</p>
                            <p>Your committee has held an extended conference with the executive committee and discussed the entire situation as fully as it was possible to do, the president of the exposition and all members of the executive committee being present, and is pleased to report that a substantial consensus of opinion was eventually arrived at, that the present situation does not seem to make it necessary that the office of director general be created at this time, but that the work of all the departments might be energetically pushed perhaps more satisfactorily than by any other arrangement by the appointment of a general superintendent, a practical builder, at a maximum salary of $200 per month, whose office and headquarters should be upon the exposition grounds and who should be placed in charge of any or all of the departments, with the express duty of overseeing and pushing all such work to energetic completion.  As the greater proportion of the work would be in the Department of Buildings and Grounds it would seem advisable to your committee that the nomination should be approved by the executive committee in the usual manner.</p>
                            <p>Your committee has had under consideration certain amendments to the by-laws touching the powers and duties of the president, but has not had sufficient time to conclude its deliberations on this subject, and would ask that it have further time to consider and report on the same.</p>

                            <p>Manager Kirkendall presented a report of his department, with the request that it be read.  He stated that he had prepared it in accordance with the intent of the resolution adopted by the board at the last meeting, directing the manager of each department to make reports of the operations of his department at the regular meetings of the board.  The report was a very voluminous document, covering the work of the Department of Buildings and Grounds since the commencement of active work on the exposition.  It recited in detail the employing of the architects, superintendent of construction, engineers, and all the other employes of the department, the dates upon which the contracts for the various kinds of work had been let, including the contracts for the buildings, gradings, etc.  It was stated that the carpenter work for the buildings on the main court will be completed by March 1, the Art building being probably the last one to be completed, and it was estimated that the staff work on this building would be completed within fifteen days after that date, making sure that all of the buildings will be ready for occupancy not later than the middle of March.</p>
                            <p>The report also stated that the boiler house for furnishing power to operate the exposition would be commenced today, the building being located at the extreme north end of the bluff tract.</p>
                            <p>The details of the building contracts were stated at length, the total of the contracts for buildings already let being stated as $317,621.15.  On this amount there has been paid in estimates to November 1 the sum of $68,562.66.  For fencing, sewers and other work being done on the grounds by day's work there has been expended the sum of $11,787.  The general expense account of the department, including salaries, taxes on leased lots and other miscellaneous items was stated to be $46,134.36, making a total expenditure by the department to November 1 of $126,484.91.</p>
                            <p>Following the reading of this report General Manderson asked for a statement from the Department of Ways and Means.  Manager Lindsey stated that he would have a full report ready at the next regular meeting of the board, but had nothing to add to the regular monthly report which had been furnished to all the directors.</p>

                            <p>General Manderson commented rather severely upon the showing made by that report, saying that it was very evident that some people who had subscribed for stock in the exposition were not paying the assessments which had been made.  He declared that it was unfair to thus evade the responsibility which had been voluntarily assumed and charged that some people were sailing under false colors by subscribing large sums and then refusing to pay the assessments.  He suggested that it might be well to publish in the newspapers the full subscriptions list, including the names of subscribers, the amount subscribed, the amount levied, the amount paid and the balance of the levy remaining unpaid.  In conclusion the general said he would "serve divine notice" that at the next meeting of the directory he would introduce such a resolution, providing that such publication would be made at a certain date, set far enough ahead to allow all time "to get on the right side of the list."</p>

                            <p>This was the statement made by Vic Bierbower of Shoshone, Idaho, as he gazed about the main court at the exposition grounds and admired the prospect for a beautiful architectural effect.  Mr. Bierbower formerly lived in Omaha, and has been for several years identified with public affairs in Idaho, having held the office of United States district attorney for a number of years and having been lieutenant governor of the state during the term ending with the beginning of the current year.  He has taken a lively interest in the exposition and assisted in entertaining the party of exposition promoters who visited the mountain states last summer.  He also appeared before the legislature of Idaho and endeavored to persuade the members that an appropriation should be made for a state exhibit, but no state appropriation was made.</p>
                            <p>"I have been quite enthusiastic over the idea of a transmississippi exposition," said Mr. Bierbower, "but I had no idea that the people down here were making such elaborate plans for it.  I have seen glowing accounts of the affair in the newspapers and in the literature sent out, but you know I rather made allowance for newspaper enthusiasm and all that sort of thing.  But I am amazed at the evidences here on the grounds of the magnitude of this thing.  These buildings are on a magnificent scale and the sight of this beautiful main court is enough to enthuse a wooden Indian.  This will be a second World's Fair.  I must look into all the details so as to be able to tell our people back in Idaho all about it when I go home.</p>
                            <p>"Judging from the size of the Mines building, the mining exhibits are going to be a prominent feature of the exposition.  Our people are making preparations to show the people of the east what we have out there.

The clear, frosty air seemed to make the blood of the workmen circulate at a lively gait and the work seemed to fairly fly.

                            <p>The east end of the lagoon was completely covered with a thin sheet of ice which was half an inch thick in some places.  The icy covering extended nearly to Twentieth street in some places and several small boys stood about looking longingly at the shining surface, but none ventured to try it except by throwing large pieces of wood or other debris to see if the ice would break.</p>
                            <p>The grading for the Auditorium building is nearly completed, a large force of men with "slip scrapers" being engaged in finishing up the excavation.  Contractor Creedon says he is ready to start work in a hurry as soon as the graders get out of his way.</p>
                            <p>The grading of the northeast corner of the Kountze tract for the Girls' and Boys' building has been commenced, and will be completed in short order, as little grading is to be done.</p>
                            <p>Work on the bluff tract is progressing slowly.  The walks and drives are being made, and stout wire prevents visitors from getting on the place, where it is expected the great quantity of blue grass will make its appearance next spring.  The planting of the large trees along the main avenue is still going on, and is nearly finished.</p>

                            <p>The conference between the executive committee of the exposition and the Board of County Commissioners has resulted in the submission of a formal request to the commissioners to divide the proceeds of the bonds voted by the people of Douglas county "in aid of the exposition" as follows: Apply $15,000 to the Agriculture building, to complete the same; construct the Horticulture building, estimated cost, $35,000, and call it the Douglas County Horticultural building; construct the Dairy building at a cost of $7,500, and the <choice><sic>Apairy</sic><corr>Apiary</corr></choice> building at a cost of the same amount; assist in the construction of the Auditorium building to the extent of $10,000; construct the walks and drives in the grounds at an estimated cost of $10,000; contribute $5,000 to the Machinery building and $10,000 toward the power and electric plant.</p>
                            <p>This proposition has been taken under advisement by the county board, but it is not likely that any action will be taken in the matter until the return of Commissioner Kierstead from the east.</p>

                            <p>A. G. McAusland, the commercial agent of the exposition for the Pacific coast, has returned home.  He reports that the fruit growers and representatives of other large interests in California are quite enthusiastic over the idea of making exhibits at the Transmississippi Exposition, but he says that certain of the state organizations are working against the Transmississippi Exposition and in the interest of an exhibit at Paris in 1900, on the theory that more direct benefit to the fruit growers of the state can be derived from an exhibit at Paris than at the Transmississippi Exposition.  Several of the southern counties of the state are making preparations to make extensive exhibits, but Mr. McAusland says that the northern part of the state seems to be handicapped at present by this attitude on the part of certain officers of certain state organizations.</p>

The exhibit will show the methods of crossing mountain passes, miners' outfits, costumes, culinary utensils and everything pertaining to that country.

                            <p>In accordance with a resolution adopted at a recent meeting of all railroads in the transmissouri territory, reduced freight rates on all exhibits to be displayed at the Transmississippi and International Exposition have been declared.  The Rock Island's line, west of the Missouri river, is the first to issue the circular containing the announcement, and was followed by the Union Pacific and the Burlington.  The other lines will issue their circulars within a day or two.  The reductions granted are the same as those given to exhibitors at the World's fair.</p>
                            <p>All agricultural products from points in the state of Nebraska to be exhibited at the exposition are to be transported to and from the exposition free of charge.  All other articles to be exhibited at the exposition will be charged at full tariff rates to Omaha and will be returned free, if forwarded by the line on which it is desired to return the goods.  This reduction, which practically amounts to a one-half rate, is announced amounts to a one-half rate, is announced with the provision that at the time of returning shipments the expense bills showing charges paid to Omaha or South Omaha, accompanied by a certificate to be surrendered to the Omaha or South Omaha agent, of a duly authorized official of the exposition and have not changed ownership.  Car load shipments going to the exposition must be way-billed to South Omaha, and less than carload shipments must be way-billed to Omaha.</p>

                            <p>Two carpenters and all the laborers about eight in number, remained at work on the building.  The strikers named a committee who went back to pull off the two carpenters who stayed at work.

He was assailed immediately with violent language and threats of personal injury.

                            <head type="sub">Deputy Minister of the Interior Writes to Secure Permission to Erect a Building to Contain the Exhibit.</head>
                            <p>There is every probability that the Canadian government will be represented at the Transmississippi Exposition by a government exhibit in a building to be erected by the Canadian authorities for that purpose.</p>
                            <p>A letter received by the Department of Exhibits from Hon. James A. Smart, deputy minister of the interior for Canada, makes inquiry regarding the conditions under which the Dominion government could make an exhibit.  He asked whether all the exhibits would be placed together in one of the large exhibit buildings or be distributed among the several buildings according to classification.  If the latter is the rule, he asks whether the government would be allowed to put up its own building and install all its exhibits therein.  The writer states that he has arranged for the preparation of an exhibit if satisfactory arrangements can be made, but he states that if the exhibits are required to be separated the government would not be disposed to send a display.</p>
                            <p>The policy of the Department of Exhibits toward foreign governments has been to allow them to erect separate buildings for their exhibits if they desire to do so, for the reason that as a rule the government displays are destroyed by classifying  the various exhibits constituting the whole display, and it has been thought best to make concessions to foreign governments in order to induce them to make collective exhibits.  It is probable that this policy will be pursued toward Canada and that the minister of the interior will be advised that his government may erect a suitable building for the Canadian display.</p>

                            <p>The trip to Texas to establish a feeling of reciprocity among the Texans in connection with the exposition is assuming very extensive proportions and the indications now are that there will be some lively hustling to secure places in the party.  The number originally contemplated was sixty-five, forty of these to be from the state and twenty-five from Omaha.  There are now seventy-nine names on the list, forty-eight being from towns in the state and thirty-one from Omaha, while every mail brings in more applications from parties who desire to go.</p>
                            <p>The larger towns in the state are turning out good sized delegations, Kearney leading all the rest with a party of nine of the most prominent men in the town, headed by Mayor George W. Hulbert.  Nearly every town of any considerable size is represented by from one to five delegates and the returns are not all in.  The Omaha list is increased every hour, the list already containing the names of some of the most prominent citizens.</p>
                            <p>W. H.

The plans were made by Fisher &amp; Lawrie of this city and show a building 40x60 feet, with an ornamental exterior, surmounted by a tall dome terminating in a light pavilion or lantern and flanked by four small pavilions.  The general effect is artistic and in keeping with the other buildings on the bluff tract.  The design will be submitted to the architects-in-chief for approval and a contract for its construction will be let at once.  The building will cost approximately $10,000.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;At a meeting of the Board of Directors of the government exhibit to be held at the office of the assistant secretary of agriculture Saturday, the secretary and disbursing officer will, in all probability, be selected in addition to assigning space and appropriating funds for the several governmental departments.  Both the secretary and disbursing officer will, in all probability, be employes of the government, and when their duty requires their presence in Omaha they will be there without pay, so far as the government appropriation is concerned, but will be provided with their subsistence.</p>
                            <p>At the Nashville exposition the government employed about ten watchmen or guards and three janitors, who were paid out of the government appropriation.  It is the intention, however, of the government board to ask the secretary of war for an army detail, the proximity of Fort Crook to the Transmississippi Exposition grounds being of such character as would easily admit of such disposition.  It is urged that the army in time of peace is maintained for the purpose of guarding government property and as the government exposition comes purely within the lines thus laid down it is thought the secretary will not object to a detail of ten or fifteen members of the Twenty-second doing guard duty during the exposition.  It is certain that the government exhibit is going to be run upon business principles and that the money will be saved wherever possible in order to give the people the very best exhibition from a government standpoint they have had since the foundation of the country.</p>
                            <p>Chief Executive Officer Kemper of the architect's office is still set upon the idea that there will be enough saving in the construction of the government building to erect a life saving station.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Matter that Lagged Early Takes on Energetic Life and Promises to Add Greatly to the Omaha Show.</head>
                            <p>The state buildings on the bluff tract of the exposition grounds promise to be a very prominent feature of the exposition.  This portion of the great fair seemed to lag at first and each state appeared to be standing back, as though uncertain what to do.  Illinois took the lead among the outside states and the other states, both in and out of the transmississippi region, seem to be falling over one another to get in line and have a state building on the grounds, where their people can congregate and meet those they know.</p>
                            <p>Wisconsin was the next state to take positive action in this matter and the Badger state will have a most elaborate building which will serve as a monument of the semi-centennial of the state as well as a headquarters for visitors.</p>
                            <p>Other states which are not in the transmississippi region are following the lead of Illinois and Wisconsin and are making arrangements to be represented by state buildings, as well as by extensive exhibits.  Prominent among these states is New Jersey.  The commission recently appointed by the governor of New Jersey, comprising seven of the most prominent citizens of the state, is not only entering most actively into the work of securing extensive exhibits representing the diversified industries of the state, but is also making a strong effort to procure funds for a state building.  The commissioners estimate that a creditable building could be erected for about $25,000 and efforts are being made to induce the state to appropriate this amount for that purpose.  If this should fail, it is probable that the many wealthy manufacturers and merchants of the state will be asked to subscribe to a fund to be used for this purpose.</p>
                            <p>Montana is the latest western state to take active steps to secure the erection of a state building.  W. H. Sutherlin, vice-president of the exposition for that state has been in Omaha for a few days, making arrangements for the space in the various buildings which will be used by the industries of the state in exhibiting their products.  He has visited the exposition grounds and has been most favorably impressed with the indications for a great exposition.  He has caught the state building fever, and has selected a spot upon which he says he will guarantee the state of Montana will erect a state building, which will be a credit to the state, as well as to the exposition.  He says he is confident that he will have no difficulty in securing the necessary money as soon as he returns home and lays before the leading people of his state the great extent which is to be held in Omaha next year.  Like many other visitors to Omaha Mr. Sutherlin has expressed the greatest surprise at the magnitude of the scale on which the preparations are being made.  He says that, when he impresses upon the people of his state the real truth of the matter, he is perfectly satisfied that funds will be at once forthcoming with which to put up a state building.  It will stand on the west side of the bluff tract, near Sherman avenue, and about the intersection of Emmet street.  He has reserved a space 50x50 feet at this point, with the right to increase this space.</p>
                            <p>Other states have made inquiries recently regarding the conditions governing state buildings and are evidently considering the idea of erecting a building for their people, the indications being that the bluff tract will be liberally sprinkled with the buildings in which the visitors may find their friends.</p>

                            <head type="sub">STRIKERS SEEM TO BE LEADING.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Succeed in Preventing Contractor Parrish from Getting Men.</head>
                            <p>The strike among the carpenters on the Liberal Arts building is still in force and the strikers seem to have the better of it.  Small gangs of striking carpenters and the strike committee appointed by the Carpenters' union some time ago continue to stand about the building and seek to induce the men at work to throw down their tools and quit.  They intercept the men who come into the grounds looking for work and try to dissuade them from working on this particular building.  In this way they have prevented Contractor Parrish from getting more men.  He put on two new men this morning, but the strikers claim that they persuaded the three men to quit, so that they are one ahead.</p>
                            <p>No attempt has been made to use force and the strikers take very strong exceptions to the statements made yesterday by Mr. Parrish to the effect that the strikers had taken hold of come of the men who were working and had attempted to pull them out.  The strikers say the only loud language used or the only attempt at force was on the part of Mr. Parrish.  They say he threatened to shoot one of the strikers "full of holes" and made a motion as though to draw a pistol.  Parrish admits that he "was excited" and said if he had had a pistol he would probably have used it and that he would have been sorry afterward.</p>
                            <p>The strike committee held a meeting at Labor temple last night, but no action of importance was taken.  No arrangements have yet been made for a conference between the contractor and the strikers and both sides say they will not yield an inch.  Parrish says if the strikers were kept away from the grounds he would have no trouble in getting plenty of men, but he says that the presence of men about the building all the time keeps away men who want work, but who haven't the moral courage to go to work in the presence of the strikers.</p>
                            <p>The rule adopted some time ago, excluding from the grounds all persons not having a pass, has been a dead letter to all appearances and little trouble is experienced in getting inside.  If the gates are closed those wanting to get in climb over the fences behind the buildings and the object of the rule is thus defeated entirely.</p>

                            <p>The grading contractor is now working on the site proposed for the Girls' and Boys' building, at the northeast corner of the Kountze tract.  There is very little earth to be removed at this point and the grading will be completed today or tomorrow.  A question has arisen as to allowing the children's building to be erected at this point.  Objection has been raised to it for the reason that it is too near the main court, where the largest crowds will be congregated at all times.  It is argued that a large number of children running about in this vicinity will be a nuisance, as well as being rather dangerous for the little tots.  Some of the friends of the children's building have suggested that it should be located on the bluff tract, where plenty of room would be afforded for a play ground without the dangers and annoyances which would follow its erection at the point proposed.  It is probable that the matter will be taken up by the executive committee at an early date.</p>

                            <p>Lewis W. Shurtliff, vice president of the exposition for Utah, is in the city making arrangements for the exhibit to be made by his state, and has already reserved space in several of the buildings.  In the Mines building he has reserved 2,000 feet, in the Agriculture building he has taken 1,089 feet, and in the Manufactures building 868 feet.  Mr. Shurtliff is filled with enthusiasm for the exposition.  He has been in Omaha several times since the inception of the exposition, but the advanced stage of the work on the exposition grounds has served to send his enthusiasm up to the highest notch during his present visit, and he says he intends to infuse the people of Utah with some of the same enthusiasm upon his return.</p>

                            <p>The grading of the site for the power plant at the extreme north end of the bluff tract will be commenced within a day or two.  There is but little grading to be done.

                            <p>The piling foundation for the Art building is nearly completed.  All the piles are on the ground and they will be in place before the end of the week.  This building will stand about seven feet above the level of the plaza about the lagoon and will be reached by broad steps and terraces.  The Westlake Construction company, which has the contract for this building, is a St. Louis concern, and it is rather a peculiar coincidence that the architect and the contractor for this beautiful building should both be residents of the same city.  The architects-in-chief are satisfied that good results will grow out of this coincidence and that the construction of the building will be most satisfactory.</p>

                            <head type="sub">FATAL ACCIDENT AT EXPOSITION GROUNDS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Carpenter on Mines and Mining Building Loses His Balance and Tumbles Seventeen Feet, Dying Almost Instantly.</head>
                            <p>The first fatal accident in connection with the building of the Transmississippi Exposition occurred early this morning, William S. Morrow, a carpenter employed upon the Mines and Mining building breaking his neck.</p>
                            <p>Morrow has been employed since last July by Contractor C. R. Cushman.  He has worked on the Administration building, but this morning it became necessary to shift some of the men, so Morrow, with several others, was ordered over to the Mines and Mining building.  When the men went to work shortly after 8 o'clock Foreman George Campbell set them to driving some heavy iron bolts into one of the wooden roof trusses, which have lately been put into position.  In order to do this three men, including Morrow, occupied a scaffolding built alongside the truss.  Morrow was given a sledge hammer and as the other two men placed the bolts in position he drove them home.  One of the bolts stuck slightly as it was being driven, and Morrow struck an unusually heavy blow.  The sledge glanced, and the momentum of the stroke threw the workman off his feet.  Morrow fell to the gallery below, a distance of about seventeen feet.  He struck upon his head, and in the fall his neck was broken.  He died without uttering a sound.</p>
                            <p>Foreman Campbell and others ran to his assistance and City Physician Ralph was called.  Morrow was beyond human aid, however.  The body was tenderly lowered to the main floor of the building and later removed to the morgue, where Coroner Burket held an inquest this afternoon at 2 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>Morrow was about 36 years of age at the time of his death and has been a resident of this city for about a year.  He worked for a short time for the Omaha Street Railway company at the power house at Twentieth and Harney.  Previous to coming to Omaha the deceased lived with a sister, Mrs. Levi Wallace, at Elmo, Mo.  She has been notified of the death of her brother.  Morrow lived with his employer at 2414 Wirt street since he was employed at the exposition grounds and had the reputation of being an honest, industrious man.  He was a member in good standing of lodge No. 6 of the Odd Fellows of Elmo, Mo., and was also a member of the local Carpenters' union No. 427.  The funeral will be conducted under the direction of these two organizations.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WORK ON THE BIG BUILDINGS.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Progress of the Construction Has Reached an Advanced Stage.</head>
                            <p>The roof is rapidly going on the Manufactures building.  The big trusses spanning the central part of the building are being raised as <choice><sic>fasta s</sic><corr>fast as</corr></choice> possible and this portion of the work will be finished by Monday noon if nothing happens to delay the work.  The covering on the west end of the roof is being put on and the building will be under roof within a short time.  The plastering of the gallery is finished entirely around the building and the plasterers are working on the walls on the main floor.  The south and west walls are finished and work has been commenced on the north wall.  The windows are on the ground ready to be put in place and this work will be commenced at once.  <choice><sic>Thes taff</sic><corr>The staff</corr></choice> workers are nearly through with their work on the main portions of the building and are "pointing up" the ornamental work.  The corner pavilions are not yet finished by the carpenters and the staff workers have not commenced work on them.</p>
                            <p>The roof trusses are being put on the Mines building, about half of them being in place.  The roof covering is being put on as fast as the trusses are placed.  The staff workers and plasterers expect to commence work on this building at once.  The whole force has been concentrated on the Manufactures building, but this is about finished, and a part of the men will be put at work on the Mines building.  The outside of the building has been ready for the lathers for several days.</p>
                            <p>The driving of the piles for the Auditorium has been commenced.  Contractor Creedon is pushing the piledriver as fast as possible, as he has been waiting some time for an opportunity to go to work.  He has all of the material for his building on the ground, even to the covering for the skylights, and is anxious to get started on the building.</p>
                            <p>The contractor for the Art building has commenced cutting off the piles of the foundation for that building.  The material for this structure has not arrived, although the bill of lading for it was received several days ago.</p>
                            <p>The sewer which is to serve the state buildings on the bluff tract, and the Horticulture building is nearly completed.  It extends from Sherman avenue at Spencer street, where it joins the small sewer in  Sherman avenue to a point opposite the Illinois building on Fifteenth <choice><sic>stret</sic><corr>street</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>The Administration building is now in the hands of the carpenters, who are putting on the finishing touches.  The casings for the doors and windows and the ornamental work about the stairways is being put in place.  The stairway leading to the upper portion of the building has now reached a point where visitors may mount to the top without danger of tumbling to the bottom.  The view from the belfry just beneath the high sloping roof is a more enchanting one, and the entire exposition grounds may be surveyed from this elevation.</p>
                            <p>The ground immediately in front of the Machinery building is being cleared and the bases for the columns which will support the colonnade extending along the entire front of this building are being set in position.  These preparations are for the purpose of putting in the concrete floor which will be laid in the colonnade as the work must be finished before the weather gets too cold.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Two Hundred Thousand Gallons Escape in Twenty-Four Hours.</head>
                            <p>The flow of water into the lagoon on the Kountze tract was stopped yesterday morning, and a careful measurement was taken at that time of the height of the surface of the water by Engineer Ralls, who has charge of the work on the grounds.  Another measurement was taken at the same hour this morning, and it was found that the water had fallen exactly one inch.  This means a loss of 200,000 gallons of water in twenty-four hours by evaporation and seepage.  With the high temperatures which prevail in the summer time the loss by evaporation will be much larger than it is at this time.</p>
                            <p>There seems to be but little doubt but that a large part of the loss is shown by the measurements just taken is due to the fact that the water finds an outlet beneath the sheet piling.  A proof of this is found in the excavation now being made by the contractors who are laying water pipe in the main court.  A ditch was opened yesterday at a point just west of Twentieth street and about sixty feet north of the lagoon.  The opening was made for the purpose of putting in the connection for the big Agricultural building.  The bottom of the ditch is slightly below the bottom of the sheet piling and the water stands in this ditch several inches in depth.  When trenches were dug all along this part of the grounds a few weeks ago, before the lagoon had been filled, there was no water encountered.</p>
                            <p>Just what percentage of the loss of water is due to evaporation and how mush is lost through seepage has not yet been computed.</p>

                            <p>Ex-Governor Packard, chairman of the executive committee of the Iowa commissioners of the Transmississippi Exposition, reached the city last evening and took a good deal of interest in the regular weekly meeting of the executive committee of the Council Bluffs auxiliary.  He is here for the purpose of settling the question of the charges that are to be made for the use of grounds for a site for the Iowa state building and for selecting the site as well as ascertaining the space that will be given in the main buildings for the Iowa exhibit.  Governor Packard was greatly pleased with the prompt action taken by the local committee to procure the rescinding of the action taken by the exposition management in the matter of charging for the site of the state building and was very much gratified by the semi-official intimation that was given him last evening that the management would probably recede from the position assumed.  The committee appointed at the meeting last week for the purpose of conferring with the management in Omaha will accompany Governor Packard on his visit to Omaha this morning and will assist in laying the matter before the exposition management.</p>
                            <p>The meeting of the Council Bluffs committee last evening was well attended by the members and the enterprises afoot were discussed with more than ordinary confidence and enthusiasm.  The plans for the big wigwam were submitted and explained by Architect Woodward.  A wigwam committee was appointed, consisting of Victor Bender, Superintendent Hisey, E. F. Clark, Leonard Everett, M. Wollman and O. P. Wickham, to take charge of the erection of the building and all of the negotiations.</p>
                            <p>Considerable time was again given to the discussion of the problems connected with the purchase and sale of the Pottawattamie exposition button.  It was decided that it was necessary to order the button decided upon at the earliest practicable day and get them on sale.  It was suggested that there might be considerable rivalry among the people to get the first button and that it might be made to bring a good deal more than the single $1 that others were to be sold for.  Dr. Cleaver suggested that this button be put up at auction and sold to the highest bidder and intimated a willingness to start the price at $25.  President Graham suggested that if the committee could get the women interested in the button selling scheme that several thousand dollars could be raised in a short time.</p>
                            <p>Suggestions for the exhibits to be shown in the building were made.  One of the members stated that he had a proposition from a well-known citizen who has earned the reputation of raising the largest specimens of all kinds of fruit and fancy stock to produce a turkey gobbler that would weigh at least sixty pounds.</p>
                            <p>The committee on literature was instructed to prepare matter for the country papers, with a view of increasing the interest in the county exhibit.</p>

It had an exhibit in one of the main buildings at the Nashville exposition, but Mr. Richards says the officers of the road have given instructions that a more extensive exhibit shall be made at the Transmississippi Exposition, and he is negotiating for space <choice><sic>fo</sic><corr>for</corr></choice> a building 100x100 feet in which the exhibit of the road will be made.</p>

                            <p>Negotiations are pending, whereby it is hoped that a Philadelphia building will be secured for the exposition grounds.  A fund is at the command of the city authorities of Philadelphia which may be expended for this purpose, and an effort is being made to bring about favorable action.  The Philadelphia authorities are disposed to regard the project very favorably, and a suggestion has been made by an official high in rank in the city of Brotherly Love that Independence hall be duplicated and the famous old Liberty bell displayed in the building.  The suggestion has been met with great favor with the exposition management and efforts will be made to induce the Philadelphia authorities to carry it out.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Parrish Says He Has All the Men He Wants at Present.</head>
                            <p>The strike situation at the exposition grounds has changed very little during the last twenty-four hours.  A large gang of men gathered on the grounds this morning about time for work to commence.  Many of them were strikers and some were men without any apparent object in view except to see what was going on.  As the workmen on the Liberal Arts building came into the grounds the crowd yelled derisively at them and applied offensive epithets to them collectively.  Officer Connell, who has been on duty about the Liberal Arts building since the strike commenced, ordered the strikers to cease making a disturbance and quiet was at once restored.  No attempt at violence was made, but the presence of the policeman seemed to harass the strikers, who protested that there was no necessity for policemen.  They notified Inspectors Tamm and Baker that unless the police were taken away a general strike on the entire grounds would be declared.  No response was made to this ultimatum and in an hour or so the crowd dispersed, a small knot of the strikers retiring to the gate at Twentieth street.</p>
                            <p>No conference has been held between Contractor Parrish and the strikers and none is in prospect.  Parrish says he now has all the men he can handle for the present, as he is setting up big posts which support the roof and says he cannot work very many men until these posts are all in position.  He put on a few more men this morning, several of them being from out of town.</p>
                            <p>The news of the frequent strikes on the exposition grounds is bringing in men from smaller towns and they are taking the places of the strikers as fast as the opportunity offers.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SUTHERLIN TALKS OF HIS INTENTIONS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Commissioner Reserves Space for His State's Exhibits and Says He Will Secure Funds for a Building.</head>
                            <p>W. H. Sutherlin, vice president for the exposition for Montana, has returned from Chicago, enroute to his home, and has reserved space in the Agricultural and Mines building for Montana's exhibit.  He has reserved what he regards as the smallest amount of space the state can have for an exhibit at all creditable and has reserved the right to increase this amount after consulting with the state officials and prominent men interested in seeing the state well represented.</p>
                            <p>The space reserved in the Mines building is 40x60 feet at the intersection of the main aisles, being 2,400 square feet in the most prominent spot in this great building.  Mr. Sutherlin good naturedly declined to give any intimation of the form which the exhibit to be made by his state would take, saying that he did not want to give the other mining states a hint of what Montana is doing, but he said he could give the assurance that the exhibit will be a highly creditable one and will possess features which will make it one of the main points of attraction in the Mines building.</p>
                            <p>In reply to a question as to whether the exhibit would include the silver statue which attracted so much attention at the World's fair, Mr. Sutherlin said it might include the statue or it might include something equally attractive, but along other lines.  He added that prominence will be given the copper producing industry of the state.  He said the Montana claims to have the finest copper mines in the country, and these are being worked at a rapid rate, with enough copper in sight in some of them to keep several generations at work.  The copper and gold mines are the only mines that are now being worked, the silver mines being shut down on account of the low price of silver.</p>
                            <p>In the Agriculture building Mr. Sutherlin reserved a space near one end of the building 24x50 feet.</p>
                            <p>The state of Montana appropriated $15,000 for a state exhibit, and at <choice><sic>th etime</sic><corr>the time</corr></choice> the appropriation was made it was announced that Marcus Daly, the millionaire mine owner, had agreed to "cover" any appropriation the legislature might make.  Mr. Sutherlin stated that he regarded Mr. Daly's position as good as paid, thus making $30,000 that will be available for a state exhibit.  Since his visit to Omaha this time Mr. Sutherlin has become thoroughly convinced that the necessary amount for this can be raised by private subscription.  He will take this matter up as soon as he reaches home.  He has selected a site on the bluff tract which he will recommend as a location for the state building.</p>
                            <p>The governor of Montana now has under consideration the appropriation of a state commission to assist Mr. Sutherlin in the duty of seeing that the state is properly represented at the exposition, and these appointments will probably be announced in a short time.</p>

                            <p>G. W. Hervey, secretary and treasurer of the Transmississippi Fruit Growers' association, which was formed in Omaha last August for the purpose of holding a fruit carnival at the exposition, is sending out circulars to the secretaries of all the state horticultural societies in the transmississippi region, asking them to lay before their societies an invitation to join the association referred to.</p>
                            <p>The circular in question reviews the action resulting in the formation of the Fruit Growers' association, setting forth the purpose of the organization to be the holding of an apple carnival at the exposition during the season of 1898, at which all transmississippi states raising fruit, especially apples, are invited to participate.  The organization has the following officers: A. F. Coleman, Corning, Ia., president; N. F. Murray, Oregon, Mo., vice president; G. W. Hervey, Omaha, secretary and treasurer; John F. Stinson, Little Rock, Ark., and M. G. Edwards, Glenwood, Ia., members of the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>These circulars also contain the announcement that a meeting of the Transmississippi Fruit Growers' association will be held at Lincoln January 12 for the purpose of further perfecting plans for carrying out the work for which the association is formed.  Each state horticultural society is asked to appoint delegates to attend this meeting.  The meeting will be held at the same time as the regular meeting of the Nebraska Horticultural society, and the display of fruits, which is always made a feature of the annual meetings of the latter society, will serve as an additional inducement to delegates from other states to attend.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Ethnological Exhibit to be Arranged for at the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>The Chicago Post of November 17 prints a column interview with Manager Rosewater regarding the exposition, prominence being given to the proposed ethnological exhibit showing the American Indian as no exposition has ever attempted to show him.</p>
                            <p>In this connection Mr. Rosewater is quoted as saying: "The executive committee intends to have one special feature in the form of an ethnological exhibit.  It will form an exhibition of Indians such as no one has yet had an opportunity to see.  The government is to have this exhibit, according to our present plans, and the matter must be presented to the officials at Washington.  For that reason I shall go to Washington after my business at New York and Boston is finished.  Indians are dying out, and such a feature as this exhibit cannot be made so perfect in the years to come.  Our plan is to have the government place at the exposition fifteen Indians from each tribe.  From time to time they would have their feast days, and it is also proposed that every few weeks others shall take the places of those on the exhibition.  While the exposition officials would have no control over this department, admission to it would not cost an extra fee.  Congress will be asked to make an appropriation for this purpose, and we intend to make it an important part of the fair."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Company Formed to Push the Stitch Concession to Success.</head>
                            <p>Articles of incorporation of the Afro-American Exposition company have been filed in the office of the county clerk.  The capital stock is named as aggregating $60,000.  The incorporators are George F. Stich, George B. Haynes and C. K. Mead.  The purposes of the company, as detailed in the <choice><sic>artices</sic><corr>articles</corr></choice> of incorporation, are to maintain and operate an Afro-American village upon the exposition grounds, where will be shown the negro as he appears upon his native heath.  There will be theaters and other places of amusements.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Stitch has outlined a most elaborate plan for his concession.  He proposes to make the village an illustration of the progress of the negro in mechanics and manner of living and especially in the musical line.  He says he will have perfect illustrations of the daily life of the plantation negroes in ante-bellum days, showing their modes of work and their methods of amusement, showing in this connection all forms of dancing and playing upon musical instruments, and he will show, in contrast to this, the advancement that has been made in music be having noted negro musicians, including the "Black Patti," Sam Lucas and other noted musicians.  A band and orchestra, composed of good talent, will form one of the attractions in the village, and some of the most noted colored orators in the country are expected to participate in the dedication of the street.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Stitch has selected a location on the Midway, opposite the street of Cairo, which is at the upper end of the bluff tract.  In addition to the attraction already named he proposes to have the street dotted with cabins, and to have old "mammies" selling flap-jacks, ginger bread and other toothsome dainties, which are characteristic of southern villages, and also to operate a restaurant where southern dishes will be on sale.</p>

                            <p>City Engineer Rosewater says that in the light of common sense and well authenticated records on the subject of evaporation the supposition that the inch of water lost from the lagoon on the exposition grounds during the twenty-four hours might have been caused by evaporation is nonsensical.  The best authorities agree that in no part of the United States the total evaporation during the hot months of June, July and <choice><sic>Augusa</sic><corr>August</corr></choice> exceeds three-tenths of an inch.  This would be one-three hundredth of an inch in twenty-four hours.  An experiment in the tropics where the thermometer ranged between 115 and 125 degrees showed that the total evaporation in sixteen days from a body of clear water eight feet deep was only two inches.  Consequently he contends that at this time of the year the evaporation from the lagoon during twenty-four hours could not possibly exceed 1,500 gallons, which would not make a <choice><sic>noticable</sic><corr>noticeable</corr></choice> difference in the depth of the water.  The same authorities that are quoted above show that in this country the normal seepage from a reservoir is about one-half inch a day after the bottom has become settled and considerably more while the work is new.  Consequently the seepage of one inch in twenty-four hours from the lagoon is not at all exceptional.</p>

He says that J. W. Woodside, who was a state commissioner, appointed by the governor at the time when it was intended that the state should have an exhibit, has manifested a great interest in the Transmississippi Exposition.  Mr. Woodside was a commissioner to the World's fair and is said to be a business man of high standing in the community.  He has assured Mr. Ford that he will take hold of the matter of having Philadelphia represented at Omaha and anticipates that no difficulty will be encountered.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, Nov. 20.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The government board having charge of the government exhibit at Omaha next year held a meeting at the office of Assistant Secretary of Agriculture Brigham, this morning, the full membership being present.  W. V. Cox was elected secretary and S. L. Lupton disbursing clerk, both having occupied like positions at the Nashville exposition.  Space was allotted to several departments as follows: Agriculture, 3,823 square feet; Treasury, 3,380; State, 945; Postoffice, 2,175.87; Fish commission, 5,027.75; Navy, 3,303.63; National museum and Smithsonian institutes, 3,406.37; Interior, 4,006.37; War, 3,303.63; for working postoffice, 315 square feet.</p>
                            <p>The following money appropriations were made: State, $4,500; Treasury, $17,000; War, $11,000; Navy, $13,000; Postoffice, $8,000; Interior, $18,000; Agriculture, $15,000; Justice, $3,000; Smithsonian institute, $20,500; Fish commission, $20,000; common fund, $20,000.</p>
                            <p>The center circular space is reserved by the Treasury department for a large revolving lens.  The executive committee selected is: De Ravenel, Michael, Kemper and Clark.  Kemper, representative of the Treasury department, reported by-laws and suggested additional legislation.</p>
                            <p>A committee consisting of Brigham, Agriculture; Clarke, Interior, and Kemper, Treasury, was appointed to consider matters of legislation in relation to the government exhibit.  It may be necessary to prepare a new bill in order to perfect some of the administrative features of the original act appropriating $250,000 for a government building and making an exhibit.  The committee was authorized to confer with senators and members of congress from Nebraska in order to bring about harmony in the law as at present. While the present law does not affect the general scope of the exhibit, those intrusted with making a government exhibit, after the knowledge gained at Nashville and Atlanta, feel that there should be changes made of such a character as would enhance the government exhibit and shape the administration in connection with the everyday workings of the board.</p>
                            <p>All matters in relation to the employment of persons other than those selected today by the board were left entirely in Colonel Brigham's hands, the board feeling that it had gotten all it could when it selected Cox as secretary and Lupton as disbursing clerk, the latter to receive $1,800 per annum.  Lupton was formerly on the Treasury department roll, but for two years past has not been connected with the government, except as disbursing clerk of the government exhibit at Nashville.  Secretary Cox, who is connected with the Smithsonian institution, will be given subsistence while in Omaha.  Colonel Brigham was made ex-office chairman of the executive board.  Mr. Kemper, who has charge of matters relating to legislation, will in all probability have a meeting of the committee next week, when the bill will be gone over more carefully and changes agreed upon.</p>
                            <p>The Government building as at present planned contains 28,000 square feet of space.

                            <div3>
                            <p>Prof. F. W. Taylor has returned from Denver, where he attended the meeting of the Colorado Horticultural society.  He reports that within the last few months the people of Colorado have experienced a great change of heart towards the exposition and are doing everything to make certain that Colorado will be represented in a manner that will show the resources of the state to the very best advantage.  This matter formed a prominent feature of the discussions of the horticultural society and a committee was appointed to take full charge of the matter of seeing that the horticultural interests of the state are given the representation which their importance merits.  This committee includes the following: G. J. Carpenter, Fruita; G. M. Anderson, Boulder; Ben Honnett, Harris; E. M. Smith, Rocky Ford, and Prof. C. S. Carpenter of the Colorado Agricultural college at Fort Collins.  Prof. Taylor says that G. J. Carpenter, the chairman of the committee, is a former resident of Nebraska, having lived at Fairbury and having been secretary of the Nebraska Horticultural society for two years.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Carpenter told Prof. Taylor that the people of the vicinity in which he resided would be on hand during the fruit festival with several carloads of peaches and would reproduce Grand Junction Peach day in a way which would open the eyes of visitors to the exposition to the magnitude and extent of fruit growing in Colorado.</p>
                            <p>J. C. Kain of Rocky Ford assured Prof. Taylor that the people in his section of the state where he resided would also be "strictly in it" at the fruit festival and would send two or three cars filled with luscious watermelons and muskmelons.</p>

                            <head type="sub">NAMING THE FESTIVAL.</head>
                            <p>Suggestions of names by which to designate the fruit festival to be held on the exposition grounds some time in September or October continue to be received by Prof. Taylor.  No selection has yet been made, and the professor still invites everyone who has a name to suggest to send it in.</p>
                            <p>A number of names for this occasion have been suggested.  The following have been received within the past few days: "Juicy Harvest," by W. H. Brigsby of Pender; "Garden of Hesperides," by John A. Miller; "Pomona's Temple," by P. L. Forgan; "Pomona's Feast," "Pomona's Festival" and "Feast of Pomona," be E. F. Test, who favors the latter.  Charles W. Young of Omaha suggests the "Garden of Paradise," "Apple Carnation" or "Lavinrac Elppa," the latter being Apple carnival spelled backward.</p>
                            <p>The indications are that the occasion will be a veritable feast and that visitors to the great show will be given an opportunity to eat all they want of every kind of fruit in season.  Judging from reports coming from all quarters the ground set aside for this feature of the exposition will be filled to overflowing with great quantities of fruit of all kinds, which will be given to all comers without price.  The great fruit producing states are becoming aroused to a spirit of rivalry and each is promising to outdo the others.  Apples of every variety from Iowa, peaches of all kinds, big, juicy watermelons and fragrant muskmelons from the valleys of Colorado, all kinds of fruit from Missouri, Arkansas and other transmississippi states promise to afford a feast compared with which the banquets of the old gods on the hills of Olympus sink into insignificance.</p>

                            <p>Citizens of Kansas are beginning to realize the importance of the Transmississippi Exposition, and the business men in the leading towns are taking steps to make up for the valuable time that has been lost.  A movement is on foot to organize a state commission to see that the state is properly represented.</p>
                            <p>E. S. Tucker of Lawrence, commercial agent for the Department of Exhibits in Kansas, writes to the department that he has visited Wichita, Peabody and Emporia, and finds that a change in sentiment has occurred during the last few months.  He says that the business men seem to be just grasping the idea of the exposition and are taking active steps to make as good a showing as possible.  The Commercial club of Wichita has taken action on the matter and Mr. Tucker says the club will see that the county in which Wichita is situated is represented <unclear/></p>
                            <p>The Emporia Commercial club has called a meeting to take action on the matter, according to Agent Tucker, who says that he has interviews with the governor, who has agreed to appoint a commission of representative and prominent men who will take hold of the matter and push the idea of a state exhibit.  The mining and other commercial interests of the state are reported to be aroused to the importance of being at the exposition, and Mr. Tucker says he has every reason to believe that Kansas will be well represented when the time comes.</p>

                            <p>The Building Trades council, in which is represented all the organized building trades unions, held a prolonged special meeting last night to consider the strike situation on the exposition buildings that are being erected by Hamilton Brothers and Contractor Parrish.  Robert Hamilton was admitted to the meeting and adhered to his original proposition, which was that he should be given $200 to recompense him for any loss he might sustain by putting the union scale into effect at once, or that he be allowed thirty days before putting the scale into effect.  After a discussion, which lasted until after midnight, the proposition was refused, and it was decided to declare the contracting firm "unfair" if it did not put the scale into effect.  The firm is given until not later than next Tuesday to come to these terms.  If it is declared "unfair" it will be unable to employ any union labor upon any contracts anywhere.</p>
                            <p>The Carpenters' union also held a meeting and received a report from the committee appointed some time ago.  It was decided to continue the strike.  In this, as in the other meeting, there was some talk of trying to bring about a sympathetic strike throughout the city, but no action was taken.  Labor Commissioner Kent was in attendance at the meetings.  He is trying to adjust the difficulty.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Commissioner Reserves Space for His State's Exhibits.</head>
                            <p>W. H. Sutherlin, vice president for the exposition for Montana, has returned from Chicago, enroute to his home, and has reserved space in the Agricultural and Mines building for Montana's exhibit.  He has reserved what he regards as the smallest amount of space the state can have for the exhibit at all creditable and has reserved the right to increase this amount after consulting with the state officials and prominent men interested in seeing the state well represented.</p>
                            <p>The space reserved in the Mines building is 40x60 feet at the intersection of the main aisles, being 2,400 square feet in the most prominent spot in this great building.  Mr. Sutherlin good naturedly declined to give any intimation of the form which the exhibit to be made by his state would take, saying that he did not want to give the other mining states a hint of what Montana is doing, but he said he could give the assurance that the exhibit will be a highly creditable one and will possess features which will make it one of the main points of attraction in the Mines building.</p>
                         <p>In reply to a question as to whether the exhibit would include the silver statue which attracted so much attention at the World's fair, Mr. Sutherlin said it might include the statue or it might include something equally attractive, but along other lines.  He added that prominence will be given the copper producing industry of the state.  He said that Montana claims to have the finest copper mines in the country, and these are being worked at a rapid rate, with enough copper in sight in some of them to keep several generations at work.  The copper and gold mines are the only mines that are now being worked, the silver mines being shut down on account of the low price of silver.</p>
                            <p>In the Agriculture building Mr. Sutherlin reserved a space near one end of the building 24x50 feet.</p>
                            <p>The state of Montana appropriated $15,000 for a state exhibit, and at the time the appropriation was made it was announced that Marcus Daly, the millionaire mine owner, had agreed to "cover" any appropriation the legislature might make.  Mr. Sutherlin stated that he regarded Mr. Daly's portion as good as paid, thus making $30,000 that will be available for a state exhibit.  Since his visit to Omaha this time Mr. Sutherlin has become thoroughly convinced that his state must have a building, and he expresses the conviction that the necessary amount for this can be raised by private subscription.  He will take this matter up as soon as he reaches home.  He has selected a site on the bluff tract which he will recommend as a location for the state building.</p>
                            <p>The governor of Montana now has under consideration the appointment of a state commission to assist Mr. Sutherlin in the duty of seeing that the state is properly represented at the exposition, and these appointments will probably be announced in a short time.</p>

Lincoln has reserved five berths for a party which is headed by the mayor and has sent notice that five more may be asked for.  The lists for the state will be held open until the first of next week and places not then taken will be turned over to some of the Omaha delegates who are now standing on the outside.</p>
                            <p>It has been decided that the size of the party will not be increased, as the people of the towns along the route have sent word that they are making preparations to entertain sixty-five people and the managers of the trip have decided that it would be inadvisable to impose on them by taking a larger delegation.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Transportation is engaged in getting out shipping tags to be furnished foreign exhibitors who will ship goods to the exposition.  Under the provisions of an act of congress passed just before the World's fair, and which act has been made to apply to all subsequent expositions, exhibits from foreign countries are required to be marked with tags bearing the flag of the country from which the exhibit is shipped.  This rule is enforced by the Treasury department as a means of quickly identifying goods intended for the exposition and on which no duty is collected.  Under the instructions of the secretary of the treasury these tags are being made 8x12 inches in size, with the flag of the country, in proper colors, covering the entire face of the tag.  Shipping directions are then printed across the face of the flag in black letters.  The question has been raised whether this defacing of the flags would not be objectionable to the governments of the respective countries, but a letter of inquiry to the secretary of the Treasury on this point brought instructions to make the tags in this manner.</p>

The plans were submitted by the architects and were discussed at length by the members of the board with the advice of City Engineer Rosewater and Assistant Engineer Stenger.  It had been expected that bids would be advertised for at once if the plans were approved, but after the consideration the board was not ready to act on so important a matter without further investigation and action was postponed.  It was general opinion that the depression of the roadway over the island should be eliminated so that it would be very level between the crowns of the two bridges.</p>

                            <p>The strike of the carpenters employed on the Liberal Arts building is having a very marked effect on that building, and work on it is practically at a standstill.  About fifteen men are going through the motions of working, but no progress whatever is being made.  According to a competent authority there are only two men at work on this building aside from the contractor and his foreman who know anything about practical carpenter work, and the result is that construction work is at a standstill.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the fact that the gates are all locked, with the exception of the one at Sherman avenue and Pinckney street and a man is on guard there to keep out all persons not having business on the grounds, there were about thirty striking carpenters and the strike committee appointed some time ago by the Carpenters' union standing about the Liberal Arts building all morning.  These men made no <choice><sic>atempt</sic><corr>attempt</corr></choice> to interfere with the men employed on the building or to go near them, but they stood near the building in small groups and made annoying remarks about the men who were trying to work.  They twitted the men in various ways and laughed loudly when their "nagging" made a man so nervous that he dropped his tools, as was frequently the case.</p>
                            <p>Two policemen were on duty about the building, but the strikers made no attempt at any violence and the policemen said they could not prevent the men from talking.</p>
                            <p>Under those condition little or no work is being done on this building and the exposition authorities are getting restless about the matter.  They realize that much valuable time is being lost and that radical measures must be adopted at once or the building will be seriously delayed.</p>
                            <p>Contractor Parrish insists, in answer to inquiries, that he has all the men he can handle, and that he is making as good progress as is possible at this stage of construction, but it is known that he has demanded protection at the hands of the exposition authorities, saying that if he is not protected he cannot carry out his contract.</p>
                            <p>In spite of all that can be done to prevent it, the strikers are turning fully a score of men away from the exposition grounds every day.

                            <head type="sub">Turners Plan for a Big Turnfest Next Year.</head>
                            <p>Among the several projects that the Germans of the city are considering in connection with the coming Transmississippi Exposition is one to hold a big turnfest in this city some time next summer.  The scheme is beginning to be pushed with renewed vigor at this time.  Within the next few weeks a great deal of work is to be done in making the necessary preliminary arrangements and in interesting Turners' societies, both east and west of the Mississippi river.</p>
                            <p>The plan of holding a turnfest was incubated very shortly after the exposition plan developed into something like a realty.  The local Turners broached, even at that early date, the plan of a turnfest that would be transmississippian in character.  For this purpose they commenced to lay plans for the consolidation of the western turning societies into one big turnbezirk.  The turnfest was to be held under the auspices of this bezirk.</p>
                            <p>The first decisive step was taken last April when the Nebraska and the Missouri Valley turnbezirk combined.  The former took in all the societies in this state, with a membership of about 400.  The Missouri <choice><sic>aVlley</sic><corr>Valley</corr></choice> turnbezirk had as its membership the societies in Iowa and parts of Missouri and Kansas, with 1,500 Turners.  The consolidated body assumed the name of the Missouri Valley turnbezirk and named as its officers, those of the Nebraska turnbezirk.  The headquarters were established in this city.  This was a solid foundation upon which the local Turners could work and they started to build upon it to a small degree.  The greater part of the plan, however, is to be worked out during the coming winter.  It is proposed in a similar manner to bring together into one bezirk all the societies in the country west of the Mississippi river, either for a permanent organization or a temporary one.  Even if they fail in consolidating the various state and district turnbezirks they have no doubt of being able to interest all in the proposed turnfest.</p>
                            <p>It is not the intention of the Turners to be debarred by the Mississippi river on the east.  On the other hand, it is the purpose to enlist the aid of the stronger Turner societies in Illinois and Wisconsin.  Correspondence has already been commenced and the local Turners are confident that both states and possibly others in the east will send strong representative teams to the tournament.  In fact, it is promised that the entire country will be represented.</p>
                            <p>The turnfest has not yet been planned in detail.  There is plenty of time for that.  It is certain, however, that there will be events for all classes of Turners and upon all the apparatus to be found in the German gymnasiums.  Good prizes will be given and plenty of them.  It is the aim to make the prize list of such attractiveness that it will draw the best Turners in the country, both as individuals and teams, to the fest.</p>
                            <p>The turnfest, if it is held in accordance with the plans that have been laid, would undoubtedly bring thousands of Germans from the transmississippi territory to the exposition.  At the national turnfest at St. Louis the number of visitors was enormous and there is no reason why almost as many should not be brought here, as the proposed tournament is designed to be as big as that one.  There are thousands and thousands of Germans in the western states and nothing would attract them so speedily to the exposition as a tournament such as is proposed.</p>
                            <p>As already stated, the executive officers of the Missouri Valley turnbezirk expect to do a great deal of work in connection with the matter during the winter.  They are receiving the unqualified support of the societies in the state and the two in this city.  The latter, the Omaha and Southside, have both appointed committees to work in conjunction with the officers.  The combined body has just organized and expects to get down to work in the near future.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Government Exhibit Will Contain an Element of Especial Interest to the Farmers of the West.</head>
                            <p>The Department of Agriculture is endeavoring to bring about a plan of action where by the department and the exposition may work together in carrying out a scheme for an extensive exhibit showing the advantage of <choice><sic>curtivating</sic><corr>cultivating</corr></choice> fibrous plants in this country.  The Agricultural department has a bureau which is in charge of investigations which are being carried on to demonstrate the commercial practicability of raising this class of plants, and the special agent of the department in charge of this bureau has written to President Wattles to suggest means by which this industry may be made a prominent feature of the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
                            <p>Charles Richards Dodge is the agent in charge of the investigations being made by the Agricultural department and he says that the cultivation of fibrous plants has not received the attention in this country which its importance merits.  He is anxious to bring about an exhibit at Omaha which shall show to the farmers of the west the great importance of this character of crop and convince them that it will be to their interest to undertake its cultivation.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dodge says he has consulted with Secretary Wilson regarding an exhibit of this nature by the Agriculture department as a part of the government exhibit and the secretary has consented that a portion of the money allotted to the department may be used for this purpose.  It is proposed to expend this in installing in the Government building an exhibit of the different varieties of hemp and flax raised in all parts of the world.</p>
                            <p>It is proposed by Mr. Dodge that the exposition management have in the Agriculture building an exhibit of machines for cultivating and harvesting flax, hemp and rame, together with raw exhibits of raw materials.  He states that with the assistance of the Bureau of Fiber Investigations of the Agricultural department the manufacturers of these products in this country can be induced to make extensive exhibits and he suggests that such an exhibit would also afford the department the opportunity which it has long sought to test the comparative merits of the various kinds of machines.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dodge says in his letter: "There never was a time when the interest in fiber growth was attracting more attention and next year, of all years, will be a crucial one, so that much good can be accomplished by holding such a fiber meeting as I have suggested and by having such a valuable series of fiber and machines on exhibition at Omaha."</p>
                            <p>This matter will be taken up for consideration by the executive committee and some arrangements will undoubtedly be made for bringing about some such plan as is suggested by Mr. Dodge.  The adaptability of the soil of the west to the cultivation of this variety of product has been recognized for some time, but no systematic attempt has yet been made to acquaint the farmers of the west with the value of the plants and the methods of cultivation.  Considerable difficulty has also been experienced in getting proper machinery for the cultivation and treating of the crop and the aim of the Agricultural department is to encourage the manufacture of improved machinery for these purposes.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Contractor Parrish Says He Has All the Men He Needs, But the Exposition Managers Are Getting Anxious.</head>
                            <p>The strike of the carpenters employed on the Liberal Arts building is having a marked effect on that building, and work on it is practically at a standstill.  About fifteen men are going through the motions of working, but no progress whatever is being made.  According to a competent authority there are only two men at work on this building aside from the contractor and his foreman who know anything about practical carpenter work, and the result is that construction work is at a standstill.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the fact that the gates are all locked, with the exception of the one at Sherman avenue and Pinckney street and a man is on guard there to keep out all persons not having business on the grounds, there were about thirty striking carpenters and the strike committee appointed some time ago by the Carpenters' union standing about the Liberal Arts building all morning.  These men made no attempt to interfere with the men employed on the building or to go near them, but they stood near the building in small groups and made annoying remarks about the men who were trying to work.  They twitted the men in various ways and laughed loudly when their "nagging" made a man so nervous that he dropped his tools, as was frequently the case.</p>
                            <p>Two policemen were on duty about the building, but the strikers made no attempt at any violence and the policemen said they could not prevent the men from talking.</p>
                            <p>Under these conditions little or no work is being done on this building and the exposition authorities are getting restless about the matter.  They realize that much valuable time is being lost and that radical measures must be adopted at once or the buildings will be seriously delayed.</p>
                            <p>Contractor Parrish insists, in answer to inquiries, that he has all the men he can handle, and that he is making as good progress as is possible at this stage of construction, but it is known that he has demanded protection at the hands of the exposition authorities, saying that if he is not protected he cannot carry out his contract.</p>
                            <p>In spite of all that can be done to prevent it, the strikers are turning fully a score of men away from the exposition grounds every day.  They stand about the entrances to the grounds and engage in conversation every man who looks as though he was seeking work.  By argument and persuasion they induce these men to turn back, and it is only the poorest class of workmen, according to competent authority, who find their way into the grounds and secure employment.</p>
                            <p>These matters have been fully considered by the members of the executive committee and several conferences have been held with Contractor Parrish.  It is said that plans are under consideration which will bring about an amicable adjustment of difficulties and cause the work to resume rapid progress.</p>

                            <p>The Board of Park Commissioners will meet at 4 o'clock this afternoon to try to decide on final action on the plans for the Arch of States and the bridge across the exposition grounds.  It is probable that the plans for the bridge will be approved with some slight alterations, but judging from the expressions of members of the board, there is considerable doubt whether the board will consent to make the expenditure contemplated by the plans for the arch.  They agree that the structure would be a very attractive ornament and all that, but are disposed to doubt whether it would be worth an investment of $18,000 or $20,000 of the park fund.</p>

                            <head type="sub">CENTRAL IDEA OF THE EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Agricultural Exhibit Well in Hand, but Arrangements for Displaying the Minerals Have Not Yet Been Systematized.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>When the general plan of the Transmississippi and International Exposition was agreed upon by the promoters of that enterprise it was determined that the greatest prominence must be given to the two industries in which the great region west of the Father of Waters stands pre-eminent, viz: Agriculture and mining.  Desiring to impress upon a people slow to grasp the facts in their full significance the illimitable extent of the resources and the great progress which has been made in the development of the vast territory which appeared upon school geographies less than a quarter of a century ago as the Great American Desert, the promoters of the exposition decided that the twin industries, agriculture and mining, should be given the greatest prominence in every way, and that nothing should be left undone to carry out the idea to the fullest extent.</p>
                            <p>In accordance with this determination, the list of main buildings to be erected was headed by these two names and it was decided that the Agriculture and the Mines buildings should be larger, by one-third, than the other main buildings.</p>
                            <p>Imbued with the spirit of this purpose, the architects-in-chief in the first sketch of a ground plan located these two buildings at the most prominent points in the grand court directly opposite the main entrance, where they will strike the eye of the visitor as he enters the exposition grounds.  The architects of these buildings were chosen, as nearly as possible, from the heart of the districts where these industries may be said to flourish most extensively.  The architect of the Agriculture building is a resident of St. Paul, Minn., and the architect of the Mines building resides in Denver.</p>
                            <p>The ornamentation of these buildings will be extremely elaborate and will suggest the purpose to which the interior is devoted.  They will be artistic and attractive on the outside, color being liberally used in the decoration.  On the Agriculture building the colors will be those of fruits and vegetables, while on the Mines building the colors of metals will be used extensively.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">AGRICULTURE WELL WORKED UP.</head>
                            <p>The preparation of the buildings in which the exhibits will be housed is not the only step which is being taken by the exposition authorities to insure an elaborate display of the resources of the west in the lines under discussion.  Particular attention has been given to insuring an extensive and elaborate display of the agricultural resources of the transmississippi country, and Prof. F. W. Taylor has been engaged for several months in working up concerted action among the agricultural and horticultural associations of the entire west in the matter of exhibits and congresses where topics of common interest will be discussed by experts.  The work in this direction has been very extensive and has been very thoroughly done.  Interest has been aroused which had been dormant, and there is every indication that the art of agriculture will receive a most decided impetus as a result of the Transmississippi Exposition.  Not only will exhibits of every variety of food product be shown in quantity and quality, which will open the eyes of visitors from the east, but discussion of topics related to agriculture as applied to the fertile prairies will be participated in by men who have conducted scientific investigations along those lines and are qualified to advance new ideas.  The indications are that the agricultural display will surpass anything of the kind ever before seen at any exposition, and that the congresses held in conjunction with this feature of the great show will be worthy of a high place among the annals of scientific investigation.</p>
                            <p>No action has been taken by the exposition management to secure any concert of action among the representatives of the mining interests of the western states, which are in the great transmississippi region.  Each state had been left to exercise its own sweet will in the matter of a display, and, aside from a commercial agent assigned to each of a few of these states to secure commercial exhibits and state commissions appointed by the governors of four states, no one has been delegated to take charge of this most important feature of the exposition.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">IMMENSE WEALTH IN METALS.</head>
                            <p>Yet in the value of the product, in the number of people employed and in the variety of interests affected by its development the mining industry of the transmississippi region far exceeds the agricultural interests.  It is generally known, but the fact is not generally appreciated in its full intensity, that the states lying in the great transmississippi region contain within their borders all the varieties of precious and useful minerals known to the civilized world, besides building stone of every conceivable variety, marbles, onyx, jasper, asphalt and scores of other commodities which are snatched from the bowels of mother earth by the ingenuity and industry of man.</p>
                            <p>Gold is mined in nine of the states lying west of the Mississippi.  Silver is found in paying quantities in eleven of these states.  Copper is found in eleven states and it may be remarked that the Butte and Anaconda districts in Montana produce 120,000,000 pounds of copper per year, being one-fourth of the supply.  Iron is mined in thirteen states.  Tin is found in three states.  Zinc is mined in seven states and it is claimed that one-half of the zinc mined in this country is produced in Missouri, while Pittsburg, Kan., is recognized as the second zinc producing country in the union.  Lead is produced in thirteen of the states in the transmississippi region and Missouri boasts of the largest lead producing mine in the world&#8212;the St. Joe mine at Bonne Terre, which has a daily capacity of 1,500 pigs.  Coal is mined in fourteen states, quicksilver in three, mica in four, nickel in two, nitre in one, manganese in one, platinum in one, gypsum in seven, antimony in two, cinnabar in four, rock salt in four and chalk in two.</p>
                            <p>It is worthy of note that at the World's fair in Oregon displayed 398 different kinds of ores and minerals and that within the borders of the state are found the finest opals in the world, agates, jaspers, carnelians and onyx.  The turquoise mines of New Mexico are recognized as a constant source of supply of this valuable stone.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DR. DAY'S SUGGESTION.</head>
                            <p>The necessity for placing the mining display in charge of an expert who will classify the exhibits and eliminate the purely commercial features, making a collection of scientific and educational value as well as a display of pleasing appearance, was strongly urged by Dr. David T. Day of the United States geological survey when he was in the city about four months ago.  Dr. Day has been connected with the exhibits made by the government at the World's fair and the expositions following it and he said that this experience had taught him that unless this feature of the exposition was placed in charge of some one who could and would assume entire charge of it and see that no link was left out of the chain showing the continuity of the exhibit, the result would be an inconglomerate mess, ugly in appearance and utterly devoid of any educational or scientific value.  He said each exhibitor would present only the commercial features of his product and the result would be that the exhibition building would be turned into a vast storehouse with no apparent purpose in view except to enable the exhibitors to advertise their particular variety of product.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Day suggested that the mining exhibit should be arranged in such a way as to show the classification of the various minerals, the process of mining and the several methods used to extract the precious metals from the ores.  Such a method would make the mining building resemble a vast museum where an education in geology could be absorbed in a short time in a cursory sort of a way, or where the close student might stand for hours and study the particular feature which engaged his attention.</p>
                            <p>Under the procedure in force up to the time in this part of the exposition each state in which there is a commission is left entirely to itself both as to nature and extent of the exhibit.  In states where a commercial agent is at work each exhibitor will be left to exercise his own discretion as to the character of his exhibit.  Whether the full extent of the mineral resources of the great west can be shown in this way remains to be seen.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ARTISTIC HARMONY THE CENTRAL IDEA</head>
                            <head type="sub">Classification Already Completed in Its General Outlines and Many of the Details Decided on Finally.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The Department of Exhibits has concluded the arranging of the interiors of the main buildings, providing for aisles and exhibit spaces and deciding in a general way the manner in which the exhibits shall be grouped.  Each exhibitor is required to submit a plan of his exhibit, showing the material, and these plans govern to a very large extent the manner in which space is allotted.  The end sought to be attained by the department is to secure a grouping that shall be harmonious and which shall present a pleasing picture to the visitor when viewing it from any point.  To secure this result exhibits which are lofty and imposing will not be placed alongside those which are "squatty" in appearance.  The kind of goods to be exhibited will also enter into consideration in the allotment of space.  There are a number of other influences which have a bearing upon the question of location, and exhibitors are usually very insistent upon what they regard as their rights, so that the lot of the man who has the task of allotting space is not altogether a happy one.</p>
                            <p>Very little has been done in the way of assigning space to exhibits, as the policy of the department has been to wait until the last moment in order that the best results may be obtained and the general character of all exhibits definitely known.  In some few cases, however, where exhibitors have made this a condition of their application, space has been assigned to them.  There have been very few such instances, however, so that the location of the great majority of the exhibits remains to be determined.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">ELECTRICITY FOR POWER.</head>
                            <p>One point that has been determined regarding the Machinery and Electricity building is that no machinery requiring steam in its operation will be installed in this building, as the only motive power that will be supplied will be furnished by electric motors, the power being generated by dynamos located in the Power building, at the extreme north end of the bluff tract, and conveyed to the Machinery and Electricity building by large conductors.  An electric motor of the desired power will be supplied for each exhibit, and there will be no unsightly shafting running along the inside of the building to break the view and make the interior look like a huge machine shop or factory.</p>
                            <p>All exhibits requiring steam in their operation will be installed in Machinery Annex, a building to be erected on the north end of the bluff tract near the Power building.</p>
                            <p>There will be no selling of goods in any of the main buildings except the Liberal Arts building.  The foreign exhibitors will be installed in this building, and they are practically the only class of exhibitors who insist upon being allowed to sell their goods to visitors who carry them away.  They are granted this concession on account of the expense of coming a long distance and for other good and sufficient reasons.  Exhibitors in the other buildings will not be allowed to sell goods to be removed before the exposition closes.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent H. B. Hardt of the Department of Exhibits, who has been actively connected with every exposition held in the world during the last thirty years, says that he has never known of any exposition where the exhibit space was so nearly taken six months before the exposition was to open as is the case in the Transmississippi Exposition.  "If it were necessary," remarked Mr. Hardt, "the Department of Exhibits could be ready to open the exposition next week.  There are plenty of applications on file to fill all the buildings with exhibits which would be highly creditable, and we would not have to accept all the application that are on file, either.  We are going to be in position to take our pick of the best collection of exhibits to be obtained, and there is no question but that when the time comes for opening the Transmississippi Exposition the exhibitors who pass muster will be the cream of the lot."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Pottawattamie County Legislators Already Laying Their Pipes.</head>
                            <p>The committee appointed at the last meeting of the executive committee of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi association to wait upon the management of the exposition in Omaha and secure the rescinding of the charge for the site for the Iowa building has completed its work and prepared its report.  The report will be submitted to the association at its next meeting and will show that the request made by the resolution has been complied with.  There will be no charge made for a site for the Iowa building and all of the funds placed at the disposal of the Iowa exposition commissioners will be used to defray the cost of the building and the exhibit that will be made.  The committee, composed of Senator Pusey, William Moore and W. A. Maurer, received a pleasant welcome from the exposition management, and before the chairman had finished making the statement of the object of the visit assurances were given that no charges of any character would be made by the exposition management.</p>
                            <p>The Council Bluffs committee accompanied Chairman Packard of the executive committee of the Iowa commissioners and the assurances that the management had reconsidered the matter of exacting the charge for a site were given directly and officially to him.</p>
                            <p>While the committee was in Omaha the members assisted ex-Governor Packard in locating the state building.  The site selected is one of the most prominent on the grounds, close by the main entrance, and the building the state will erect will be one of the first objects to meet the eyes of the visitors on entering the gates.</p>
                            <p>Speaking on the subject yesterday Senator Pusey said: "We were greatly pleased with the reception accorded us.  Although we had no reason to expect any other kind of treatment, yet a committee, bearing a grievance naturally expects some rebuffs.  We were given to understand right at the start that every man interested in the management of the exposition and in its success was anxious to show the Iowa representative and the Council Bluffs committee every possible consideration.  The action will remove many of the obstacles from the way of the large appropriation that we will ask from the legislature this winter.  All of the members of the Pottawattamie delegation in the legislature will, figuratively speaking, pull off their coats and go to work from now on and get things in shape for the contest when the legislature meets.  Iowa ought to make even a more creditable showing than was made at the Columbian exposition, for the reason that more immediate and greater ultimate results will follow.  The exposition is going to be all of the great success that its originators have planned it to be, and the natural force of circumstances will compel the state to make an extra effort toward a fine display.  Among the transmississippi states Iowa stands first and her exhibit must not be second to any."</p>

                            <p>Manager Reed of the Department of Concessions says he is literally overrun with applications for all kinds of concessions.  Some of these involve concessions that are very valuable to the exposition, and others are of small consequence from an exposition standpoint, but the prospective concessionaries are just as persistent in one case as in the other.</p>
                            <p>Regarding the outlook for the Midway, Mr. Reed says he is satisfied that that feature of the exposition will be filled with attractions of the most desirable nature.  He says that the host of applications filed with the department cover all kinds and varieties of shows and the opportunity is thus afforded to select the best.  The amount of space set aside for the Midway gives ample room for granting concessions to as many attractions as may be desired, and these conditions, Manager Reed says, make it certain that this feature of the Transmississippi Exposition will equal that of any exposition ever held.</p>

                            <p>Union labor has scored victory No. 3 on the exposition grounds and the Liberal Arts building is added to the list of exposition buildings which are being erected by union labor.</p>
                            <p>Contractor Parrish gave in this morning and agreed to the only thing the labor union representatives asked, that 30 cents per hour be paid to carpenters.  Parrish has been working eight hours all along, but had been paying various prices to his men, some men employed as carpenters receiving 25 cents, some 27½ and other 30 cents per hour.  Last Wednesday the men struck and since that time the work has been dragging seriously.  Great difficulty was experienced in getting any men and few that were secured were able to do the work required of them.</p>
                            <p>An agreement was reached between Parrish and the representatives of organized labor whereby Parrish agrees to pay carpenters 30 cents per hour, but he is conceded the right to discharge any man whom he does not consider worth that rate.  Under this agreement the men heretofore employed were all discharged at noon and a new gang of fifteen carpenters were put to work.  The force will be increased in the morning by adding a like number of carpenters, and it is announced that the building will be under roof within two weeks.</p>
                            <p>This makes six buildings on the main court of the exposition grounds that are being erected by union labor, the Administration, Manufactures, Mines, Agriculture, Liberal Arts and Art buildings.  The contractor for the latter, the Westlake Construction company of St. Louis, notified the Carpenters union as soon as he came here to start his building that he would require a certain number of men and asked the union to supply them.  The other buildings have been secured only be resorting to strikes.  The other two buildings on the main court, the Machinery and Electricity and the Auditorium, are being erected by non-union labor and both contractors say most positively that they will not make any change.</p>

                            <p>County Commissioner William I. Kierstead returned this morning from Chicago, where he has been for the last two weeks in the interest of the Transmississippi and International Exposition.  Mr. Kierstead is the commissioner for the furniture section of the exposition.  He visited the large furniture houses in Chicago and succeeded in interesting them in the exposition and convinced some them of the advantage which would accrue to them by making extensive exhibits.  He brought formal applications for space from five of these houses and was assured by a number of other large establishments that they would send in their applications for space within a short time..</p>
                            <p>The Adams &amp; Westlake Manufacturing company, one of the largest establishments in the country, made application for space for three classes of exhibits.  In the furniture section they will make an elaborate display of brass beds and other high grade furnishings; in the transportation department they will show a large line of railway supplies manufactured by them, such as locomotive headlights, lanterns, car lighting systems, etc.; they will also make a display of the line of bicycles manufactured by them.</p>
                            <p>Karpen Bros., a firm which Mr. Kierstead says is the largest manufacturer of upholstery goods in the United States, will set up in the furniture section a large booth which they used for the same purpose at the World's fair.  This booth is 20-24 feet on the floor and Mr. Kierstead says it is one of the most elaborate affairs of its kind he ever saw.  It has tall columns at each corner, surmounted by handsome capitals, and 
                            
                            <pb n="129" xml:id="TMISB03-129"/>
                            
                            the walls are formed of heavy plate glass, the whole being surmounted by a roof of handsome design.  The handsome line of goods manufactured by this firm are displayed to the best advantage in this booth, making a most attractive exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The Toby Furniture company, one of the best known houses in Chicago, has applied for space and will make a display of furniture of the most elaborate kind.</p>
                            <p>J. S. Ford, Johnson &amp; Co., the largest manufactory of chairs in this country, is another firm which gave Mr. Kierstead an application for space.  He says they will make a most elaborate display of fancy chairs of the highest grade.</p>
                            <p>The Koch Barber Supply Manufacturing company will make a display of barber chairs and all kinds of barber supplies.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kierstead did not go to Grand Rapids, Mich., as he originally intended, but says he will go there in January.  At that time in each year every manufacturer of furniture in the United States makes a display in Grand Rapids for the benefit of buyers for furniture houses, and by going there at that time Mr. Kierstead expects to see the representatives of all the manufacturers in the country.</p>
                            <p>While in Chicago Mr. Kierstead was interviewed by a representative of the Record and got into print to the extent of a column in that paper.  He talked exposition and boomed Nebraska and Omaha in the most successful manner, firing a huge bundle of facts involving that state, city and exposition at the public in the most telling fashion.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Green and Gold to Decorate the Roof of the Administration Arch.</head>
                            <p>The roof of the Administration building is being painted a deep, rich green.  A great deal of experimenting was done by the architects-in-chief to secure a durable color that would be pleasing to the eye and harmonize with the general color scheme.  A number of tests were made and a color secured which, it is thought, will not face but will retain its brilliancy throughout the exposition.  The "ribs" of the roof of this building, which extend from the cornice to the lantern at the summit of the building, will be painted a brilliant gold, making a brilliant and striking contrast on the deep green background.  The ornamental metal work which forms the "corners" on this roof will also be gilded.</p>
                            <p>The roof is going on the Manufactures building at a rapid rate.  The sheeting, which is tongued and grooved and covers the entire roof with close joints, is about two-thirds finished.  The roof covering, a patented material known as rubberoid, is being put on, and the entire roof will be completed within a few days.  The windows and doors for this building are in the building and are being painted.  The window and door frames are being finished and these openings will soon be closed, enclosing the entire building.</p>
                            <p>Work on the Liberal Arts building is now going along with a rush.  The posts for the four walls are about all in place and the heavy timbers which will support the roof are being raised to their places.  The framing of the roof trusses will be commenced at once and the work will be pushed as fast as possible.</p>
                            <p>George Moore of Nashville, one of the firm of William Moore &amp; Sons, which has the contract for the Government building, started work on that structure this morning.  A small gang of men was put at work doing the small amount of grading that is necessary on this site.  The engineering force of the exposition management was engaged in setting the stakes for the piles and employes of the pile driving contractor were engaged in preparing piles for driving.  Mr. Moore stated that the lumber for the Government building has been ordered from a local dealer with the distinct understanding that no delay of any kind in the delivery of material would be tolerated.  He said work on the building would be started Monday morning, as it is expected that the piling contractor will be far enough along by that time to give the carpenters a start.</p>
                            <p>The construction of the Art building is delayed by the non-arrival of material.  Several carloads of lumber have been shipped, but they have been delayed in transit.  The piles are being dressed to the required height and preparations are being made to push the work as soon as the material arrives.</p>
                            <p>The Grant Paving company, which has the contract for putting in the concrete foundations for the boilers and engines in the Power building, at the north end of the bluff tract, has commenced getting its material on the ground.  The grading for this building is about completed.</p>
                            <p>The trusses for the dome of the Nebraska building are now all in place and the workmen are engaged in putting in putting on the sheeting which is to enclose the dome and putting in the windows which are to be in the base of the dome.</p>
                            <p>Contractor Creedon is pushing work on the Auditoriums building.  The piles for this building are not all driven, but the carpenters are following the piledriver closely, and the sill for the north side of the building is in place and the work of raising the north wall of the structure was commenced this morning.</p>
                            <p>The roof trusses of the Mines building are all in place and the sheeting which is to cover the roof is being put in place.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission has taken 11,672 square feet of floor space in the Agriculture building, 3,290 feet in the Horticulture building and 7,480 feet in the Liberal Arts building, reserving the right to increase these amounts within a specified time and giving notice that space will be taken in the Dairy, Apiary and other buildings when those buildings are erected.  In addition to the floor space named in each building the contiguous wall space is also reserved by the state.  The space in the Liberal Arts building is to be devoted entirely to the educational exhibit.  This exhibit will be in the gallery and the amount of wall space obtainable by means of partitions is almost unlimited.</p>
                            <p>The above action on the part of the state commission was taken after a conference with the executive committee, lasting all of yesterday afternoon.  Before a decision was reached regarding the amount of space to be taken by the state in the main buildings the commission was notified by the executive committee that the new course of procedure in granting ground space for the erection of state buildings without charge would be made for the ground occupied by the Nebraska building.</p>
                            <p>At the meeting of the Nebraska commission last night Chairman Neville was authorized to make formal application for the space agreed upon in the afternoon.</p>
                            <p>The meeting was held at the new headquarters in the Millard hotel, being the first meeting of the board in these quarters.  A considerable amount of routine business was transacted, together with business of importance.</p>
                            <p>B. R. Ball appeared before the commission in the interest of the posts of the Grand Army of the Republic and asked that a room be set aside in the Nebraska building for the display of relics of the war of the rebellion and other relics in the possession of old soldiers.  No official action was taken, but it was intimated that the request would be granted.</p>

                            <head type="sub">COOKING NEBRASKA PRODUCTS.</head>
                            <p>The request of Mrs. Harriet MacMurphy for an appropriation to enable her to show the superiority of Nebraska corn and wheat by cooking all kinds of dainty dishes and distributing them to investigators was granted and $500 was set aside for that purpose.  Mrs. MacMurphy will have a model cooking school in one of the buildings and the appropriation referred to is intended to cover the additional expense of giving daily demonstrations of the many different ways in which corn and wheat products may be cooked in palatable style.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Stilson of the Apiary department reported that he had purchased and stored about 800 pounds of the finest honey to be found in the state, for which he had paid, on an average, about 12&#8540; cents per pound.  He asked that $1,300 be set aside for the apiary exhibit, covering all expenses of the same.  He said the honey could afterwards be sold for about $500, making a net cost for the exhibit of about $800.  His report was approved and he was instructed to carry out his plans.</p>
                            <p>A number of bids for the plumbing, roofing and plastering on the state building were opened and contracts were ordered made with J. A. Fitzpatrick for doing the necessary plumbing and making sewer connections for $445.  The chairman of the commission was instructed to make a contract with the Elaterite Roofing company of Denver for roofing material bearing the name of that <choice><sic>cmpany</sic><corr>company</corr></choice>.  The bids for plastering the building were rejected because the board considered them too high and new bids will be asked.</p>
                            <p>But one bid was received for the staff work and this was not opened, it being explained that other bids would be submitted today, the delay in getting bids being charged to delay on the part of the architects of the state building in making the necessary specifications.</p>
                            <p>The board will hold a short meeting this morning and finish the small amount of business remaining to be done.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Many Visitors Go to the Grounds and Watch the Workmen Hustle on the Big Buildings Now Under Way.</head>
                            <p>Thanksgiving day at the exposition grounds was characterized by throwing the gates wide open to all comers and when the gatekeepers arrived at 8 o'clock they found a number of strangers waiting to get inside to see for themselves whether all that they had heard about the magnitude of the undertaking was true.  There was a constant stream of people into the grounds until nearly noon, when the drizzling rain discouraged people from undertaking a visit.  The greater part of the visitors were strangers in the city and conspicuous among them were numbers of college youths, evidently drawn to Omaha by the attractions on the foot ball fields.</p>
                            <p>Work was being pushed on all of the buildings on the main court, the contractors hurrying their men to get as much done as possible before the threatened snow storm commenced operations.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska building, over on the bluff tract, was silent and deserted the workmen having gone to their homes in different parts of the state to assist in the demolition of Thanksgiving turkey.</p>
                            <p>There was a slight premonition of trouble on the Mines building early in the morning, caused by the staff contractors, Smith &amp; Eastman, putting non-union lathers at work on that building.  The carpenters employed on the job were up in arms at once and threatened to strike unless these men were taken off.  A conference was quickly held with the staff contractors and the disturbing element was removed and quiet restored.</p>

                            <head type="sub">New Policy Adapted by Department of Exhibits.</head>
                            <p>The Department of Exhibits has adopted a new policy toward state exhibits and has decided to allot each transmississippi state a certain amount of space in the main buildings, the amount being based on the population of the state and running from 200 to 1,000 feet.  This policy was adopted in order that no state in the transmississippi region might be able to say that because its legislature failed to make an appropriation it could not make any exhibit on account of the amount charged for space.  This generous action on the part of the exposition management will cost the exposition management will cost the exposition considerable money, as space in the main buildings costs the management slightly over $1 per square foot, so that the established space charge of $1 per square foot does not cover the actual cost.  It has been urged that other expositions have not charged for space in their buildings, but in answer to this the Department of Exhibits has simply pointed to the service furnished exhibitors in addition to the space, service which, in former expositions, has cost the exhibitors much more than the amount asked in this case.  In order to put the exposition on the broadest lines, however, and to remove any shadow of excuse on the part of states which are inclined to invent forced reasons for not making exhibits, the new policy has been adopted and the transmississippi states have been notified of this action.  The first reply received to this announcement was from the governor of a certain state who asked that the amount allotted to his state be doubled, as it was not sufficient for the exhibits the various interests in the state would like to make.</p>

Mann, Okobojo; Hugh Smith, Howard.</p>
                            <p>The governor says he will appoint additional members of this board at the earliest opportunity and will call the commission together and devise some means of raising money for making a state exhibit.  He expresses regret that the bonds voted by the Black Hills district failed to go through by reason of the refusal of the canvassing board to canvass the returns on the bonds, but he expresses the hope that a way will be devised for having the entire state represented.</p>

                            <p>A novel suggestion for a Kansas exhibit is being seriously considered by the people in that state who are interested in seeing that the Sunflower state is properly represented at the exposition.  The suggestion was made by the secretary of the Commercial club of Emporia that a splendid exhibit for Kansas, and one that would not only attract much attention, but would also be inexpensive, would be to collect a ton of cancelled mortgages throughout the state and take them to the exposition.  These tokens of cancelled indebtedness or vouchers of present prosperity might be arranged in some artistic manner by a committee to be appointed by Governor Leedy.  The suggestion met with approbation, and should the governor call a special session of the legislature a bill will probably be introduced making an appropriation for this purpose.</p>

These were opened and found to be very indefinite, the bidders explaining that the specifications were so loosely drawn that they were unable to bid intelligently.  The bids were rejected and the architects, Craddock &amp; McDonald, were instructed to draw a new set of specifications covering the staff work in such a way that bidders could make their figures to advantage.</p>
                            <p>Two bids for plastering the interior of the building were received, but were considered too high and were rejected.  The secretary was instructed to readvertise for bids, to be opened at the next meeting of the commission, December 7.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The first touch of winter was very severely felt on the exposition grounds.  The temperature hovered about in the neighborhood of 15 degrees above zero, but the biting wind from the northwest swept down the long stretch afforded by the lagoon, whistling about among the timbers of the main buildings and making the workmen think the north pole was located right on the exposition grounds.  A thin coating of ice covered every stick of timber which was exposed, and a glistening mantle of white snow has settled softly down on the ground and on the piles of lumber in and about the buildings.  The sun shone with a dazzling brightness which was reflected in the myriads of ice crystals covering everything, and the huge skeletons of the buildings in the main court sparkled like the ruins of so many fairy palaces.</p>
                            <p>During the early hours of the day the workmen put in most of their time in rubbing their ears and swinging their arms to send the warm blood into their benumbed fingers.  All wore thick coats and gloves, but the freezing wind penetrated every nook and cranny and chilled the very marrow in the bones.  It was useless to tell a man that the thermometer indicated a reasonably warm day, because he knew better, and he continued to stamp his feet and swing his arms, at intervals driving nails.  The men working on the roofs had difficulty to keep from taking an involuntary slide to the ground, as every foot of timber was covered with ice, and the wind blew with redoubled violence among the rafters and trusses.</p>
                            <p>The carpenters employed on the Manufactures building took advantage of the fact that Contractor Strehlow was not on the ground at the hour for commencing work, and went home to wait for the temperature to rise.  When Strehlow arrived he sent for the men post haste, and they went to work at noon.  On the other buildings the carpenters were all at work.</p>
                            <p>The staff men on the Manufactures building are working on the colonnade on the north side of the building, nailing up the ornamental panelling forming the ceiling.  They kept right on working while the cold wind whistled about the columns of the colonnade and blew the debris in every direction.</p>

                            <p>The plasterers abandoned work entirely, as the temperature was entirely too low for them to handle plaster, and the lathers concluded that they had reached a point where they could take a short rest without delaying the plasterers and they also went home.</p>
                            <p>The gate keepers tried to get on the lee side of the tall fence and keep out of the wind.  They were comforted however, by the knowledge that the carpenters employed by the Department of Buildings and Grounds have been working for several weeks on sentry boxes for the gate keepers.  It is reported that one of these boxes is finished, with the exception that one of the windows was put in the wrong side and will have to be changed.  When the other boxes will be finished no one has been rash enough to predict.</p>
                            <p>The only man on the grounds who was comfortable while working was a man digging in the sewer ditch on the bluff tract.  This ditch is about eight feet deep and this man was working at the lowest point, where the wind did not reach him and where the earth temperature was much higher than that of the air outside.  He reported that he had no protest to make against the weather.</p>
                            <p>The workmen on the Nebraska building were gathered about a red hot stove in one of the rooms on the lower floor of the state building.  The outside of the building is closely covered with sheeting and the inside is lathed for plastering.  Temporary windows and doors made the room reasonably tight and the stove made a warm resort.  The men said it was too cold to work on the top of the dome and they were waiting for the temperature to rise.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Unique Advertisement of the Centennial State Offered for Exhibition.</head>
                            <p>Colonel J. H. Wood, traffic manager of the Colorado Mineral Palace Car company of Denver, is in the city in consultation with the Department of Exhibits with reference to securing space for two exhibition cars now being constructed by that company.  These cars are to be stocked with specimens of ore from various Colorado mines, both gold and silver, and will be hauled all over the country as a traveling exposition of the resources of the Centennial state.  The company desires to secure the space on the exposition grounds for these cars before taking them out on the road.  Colonel Wood carries with him an oil painting which he says is a faithful representation of one of these cars which has been completed.  The painting shows a car constructed on the model of a modern passenger car.  It is lavishly decorated with silver and gold and in the center of each side is a large panel on which is a handsome oil painting, emblematic of the purpose of the cars.  The central figure is a handsome young woman holding aloft a scroll on which appears the words, "Colorado Minerals&#8212;$50,000,000, 1897."  In the panels beneath the windows of the car are handsome paintings of Colorado mountain scenery, including the Garden of the Gods and other prominent spots.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Publicity has issued a special edition of a handsome illustrated pamphlet for the use of the delegation of prominent Nebraskans who will go to Texas early in December to attend the Deep Water convention and boom the Transmississippi Exposition.  These pamphlets contain sixteen pages of reading matter descriptive of the plan, scope and progress of the exposition, and inserting as a frontispiece is a half-tone engraving, 4x6 inches, of the official bird's-eye view of the exposition grounds.  There are also half-tone engravings of five of the main buildings.  The reading matter is up-to-date and states briefly and concisely in a crisp, pointed manner the prominent features of the exposition story.  One of the striking features is a list of fifty-one national and interstate conventions which will meet in Omaha next year.  Typographically the pamphlet is a gem and reflects credit on the department.</p>
                            <p>The Publicity department has in preparation a twenty-page pamphlet containing half-tone engravings of the bird's-eye view and the main buildings.  These will be for general distribution and will be issued within a <choice><sic>sort</sic><corr>short</corr></choice> time.</p>

                            <p>The water has been turned into the lagoon again.  It was found that the seepage amounted to about 100,000 gallons per day, an amount which Engineer Ralls considers very slight, considering the size of the lagoon.  This waste is at the rate of about 4,100 gallons per hour and Mr. Ralls says he will gauge the inlet so as to supply just enough to overcome the seepage and keep the water up to the ice in order to strengthen it.  The water ran over the ice yesterday and formed in "humps" all over the surface, covering up the dirt and debris which had frozen in the first ice.  By flooding the ice a smooth surface for skating will be obtained and a very few cold nights will <unclear/></p>

                            <head type="sub">ARRANGEMENTS FOR A FINE DISPLAY</head>
                            <head type="sub">Superintendent Jackson Developing Plans in Connection with the Women's Board for the Show of School Work.</head>
                            <p>The action of the Nebraska Exposition commission in securing 7,480 feet of floor space in the gallery of the Liberal Arts building for an educational exhibit to be made by the public schools of Nebraska is the source of great satisfaction on the part of those who have taken an active interest in the matter.  The officers of the Woman's Board of Managers are especially pleased over the outcome of the efforts which have been made to secure space for the school exhibits, as it was apparent from the beginning that no exhibit could be made unless space was provided without being paid for by the schools.</p>
                            <p>State Superintendent of Instruction Jackson has been appointed by the Nebraska commission to take full charge of the apportionment of the space and he has been in consultation with Mrs. Ford, secretary of the Woman's Board of Managers, regarding the general arrangement of the exhibits and the allotment of space.  As the exhibits which will be made by the large majority of the schools will require wall space it is probable that the space in the Educational section will be divided by partitions and the exhibits grouped on these, where they may be easily inspected.  This will greatly increase the amount of available space.</p>
                            <p>Under the plan as it now stands Superintendent Jackson will instruct each school desiring to make an exhibit to make application to him before February 1.  The amount of available space will be apportioned among the schools will be notified how much space has been assigned to it.  These schools will then be instructed to send their exhibits to the school superintendent of their county by April 1, and the county superintendent will be instructed to send these exhibits to Secretary Ford at Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The Woman's board wishes it distinctly understood that the individual competition instituted by the board will not interfere in the slightest degree with the school exhibits.  Under the rules of this competition judgment will be passed upon the work April 15.  All work winning prizes will be placed in the collective exhibit to be installed by the Woman's board.  The work not winning a prize will be turned over to the school to which the competitor belongs and may be placed in the exhibit made by that school if so desired.</p>
                            <p>It is more than likely that the University of Nebraska will occupy a large proportion of the space in the educational section, as it proposes to make an extensive exhibit of the work <choice><sic>o fthe</sic><corr>of the</corr></choice> university.  The complete collection of native woods which is in the possession of the university museum, the unique collection of "<choice><sic>bevil's</sic><corr>devil's</corr></choice> corkscrews," those gigantic fossils found nowhere in the world except in the alkali district in northwestern Nebraska, and many valuable specimens from the university museum will be given space in this section and will add no little interest to it.  In addition to these exhibits the university will also show the work of its classes in a manner which the faculty predicts will attract the attention of students and investigators.</p>

                            <p>Although the temperature on the exposition grounds was considerably lower this morning than it was yesterday, the wind had moderated and the workmen seemed to encounter no difficulty on account of the cold.  The work progressed rapidly, the biting air seeming to act as an incentive to exertion, and carpenters and staff men made every stroke tall<!--tell?-->.</p>
                            <p>The center pavilion of the Machinery building is being raised, this being the last section of the walls to be completed.  The cornice is nearly completed entirely around the building and the diagonal sheeting on the outside walls is <choice><sic>peing</sic><corr>being</corr></choice> put on, these portions of the building being about ready for the staff workers.  The roof trusses are being framed and the work of raising them to the top of the walls will be commenced next week.</p>

The piles for this building are being dressed to the proper height and will be in readiness to receive the sills by the time the lumber arrives.  By some mistake which nobody seems to be able to explain the piles for this building were driven such a short distance into the ground that nearly all of them have to be cut off between four and five feet and a great many have to be cut off eight or ten feet from the top.  In some cases it has been

                            found necessary to dig away the earth from around the pile for a depth of two feet and cut off the pile at this point, thus cutting away ten feet of sound timber which should have gone into the ground or should have been saved by using shorter piles.  It was found necessary, while driving some of these piles, to reinforce them by driving yet another pile along-side the first, and yet both have been cut off between five and six feet from the top.  Those informed on the subject say that reinforcement would have been unnecessary if the piles had been driven to the proper height, and that the waste caused  by the cutting off of so much of the tops could have been avoided by driving them further or using shorter and cheaper piles and a better foundation secured.</p>
                            <p>The piles for this building were driven by Frank Green, the man who figured in the Geraldine investigation.</p>

                            <p>The ice on the lagoon is thick enough for skating, but the surface is too rough to make that sport really enjoyable.  Men employed by the ice carnival concessionaires worked all of Friday night "making ice," but their efforts were not productive of good results.  A number of small boys, however, ignored such small matters and were making the most of the opportunity afforded by the large expanse of ice.  They avoided the gate keepers by climbing the fence and enjoyed themselves to their hearts' content.</p>
                            <p>The open spaces in the ice caused by the water flowing from the artesian well and from the large pipe at the west end of the island have not yet been fenced in.  The water from the artesian well is comparatively warm and the ice about the edges of the hole is quite thin.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Executive Committee of the National Educational Association Meets Officials of the Eastern Lines Interested.</head>
                            <p>Superintendent Pearse has returned from Chicago, where he attended the meeting of the executive committee of the National Educational association and saw Washington walk away with the prize for which Omaha had made such a gallant struggle.  In commenting on the failure to bring the next convention of the association to Omaha, Superintendent Pearse says that in his opinion everything was done which was possible to insure success, but evidently the pegs were not set up that way.  In fact, one of the railroad officials who was present in the interests of Washington made no secret of the fact that the matter had been "fixed" as long ago as last April, and although Omaha had all the better of the controversy on the face of the matter it was scarcely mentioned in the secret deliberations of the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>According to all precedents and exterior appearances Omaha should have won the prize.  The executive committee consists of James M. Greenwood of Kansas City, president of the association; Charles R. Skinner of Albany, N. Y., vice president; Irwin Shepard of Winona, Minn., secretary; J. C. McNeil of West Superior, Wis., treasurer, and Albert G. Lane, president of the board of trustees.  Four of the five members were, consequently, western men and would naturally be expected to favor a western city, all things being equal.  In addition to that Omaha made by for the best showing of any city that was in the race.  Not only was Omaha endorsed by an overwhelming majority at the last convention at Milwaukee, but it offered inducements far superior to those which were submitted by other cities.  Superintendent Pearse laid before the executive committee a list containing the signatures of over 1,500 Nebraska and Iowa teachers and superintendents who obligated themselves to become members of the association if the next meeting should be held in Omaha.  He also offered evidence to show that his number could easily be increased to 3,000 by January 1. if it was decided to come to Omaha.  When it is considered that the total enrollment at the Milwaukee convention was only 6,000, and it is apparent that the prospect of 3,000 new members was a tremendous inducement.  But the committee decided to overlook not only the claims of Omaha but the expressed wish of a majority of the members of the association.</p>
                            <p>The committee met Saturday forenoon and listened to the representatives of Washington, Omaha, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles and in the afternoon they went into executive session.  Soon after it was announced that Washington had been selected.  It is a significant fact that the general passenger agent of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio railroad and prominent officials of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio, the Big Four and other big railroad lines were present to urge the selection of Washington, while the officials of the roads which would profit by the selection were conspicuously absent.</p>

                            <head type="sub">George W. Fishback of Philadelphia Writes to the Department of Exhibits on a Question of Great Moment.</head>
                            <p>The way is opening for exhibits at the Transmississippi Exposition by the republics of South America, and the indicators are that official exhibits will be made by the governments of those countries.  Among the exhibits which will probably be secured from this source is a mineral collection from the Argentine Republic which was at the World's fair, and which is said to be the finest collection of its kind in the world.  An offer of $100,000 for this collection was refused by the owner, who is the director of the Department of Mines of Argentine.</p>
                            <p>The opportunity to secure these South American exhibits comes to the exposition management through George W. Fishback, of Philadelphia, who has been in close touch with the officials of the republics of the southern continent.  He was a resident of the Argentine republic for six years in an official capacity and visited all of the republics last year as the official representative of the Department of State to invite those governments to send delegates to the panamerican convention, which was held in Philadelphia last June.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Fishback writes to the Department of Exhibits that he is quite positive that if the governments of those countries were properly approached the Argentine Republic, Brazil, Chili and Peru would make government exhibits of their resources, including grains and other natural products and manufactured goods.  Argentine and Brazil, he says, could make fine exhibits of hard woods and all of the states could exhibit their manufactured products, giving the manufacturers of this country an intelligent idea of the competition they would have to meet in shipping goods to those countries.  He also says that he feels certain that he could arrange, through friends in the Argentine Republic, to secure the magnificent mineral collection which was exhibited at the World's fair, as a part of the mining exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition, as he has been informed that the owner of the collection is willing to allow it to be returned to this country with a view of its ultimate sale.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Fishback also makes several suggestions regarding amusement features which he says might be secured from these South American countries.  Among these he suggests a company of guachos, corresponding to the cowboys of the western plains, who could give an entertaining exhibition, showing how wild steers and ostriches are lassoed on the pampas of their native country.  He also refers to the national game of hand ball, corresponding to the national game of base ball, and says that a company of natives could give an interesting show by playing this game.</p>
                            <p>The suggestions outlined by Mr. Fishback will be given serious consideration by the Department of Exhibits and negotiations will be opened with the countries named with a view of securing these exhibits.</p>

                            <p>Workmen on the big buildings at the exposition grounds go at their labors with an energy that defies the rigors of the atmosphere.  While the early hours were very cold, the sun came out bravely and soon warmed the air to such an extent that working outside was not uncomfortable after 10 o'clock.  The snow flurry of Sunday did not deposit enough fleecy flakes to interfere with the workmen and the heavy timbers were shifted about with unusual energy in order to keep up a rapid circulation of blood.  There was little or no wind, and the temperature was not inconvenient.</p>
                            <p>Work on all of the main buildings is progressing in a satisfactory manner.  The Manufactures and Mines buildings are well advanced, the roofs of both being near completion.  When the skylights at the crowns of these roofs are in place the main roofs will be complete.  The windows of the Manufactures building are being put in place and the weather will soon be entirely shut out of this structure.</p>
                            <p>The trusses for the roofs of the Machinery, Liberal Arts and Agriculture buildings are being framed and all will be ready to raise within a short time.</p>
                            <p>The driving of the piles of the Government building was commenced this morning.  These are being driven without being peeled of their bark, and this, with the frozen condition of the ground, makes a little more work, but does not seriously delay the driving.  The lumber for this building is being delivered on the ground and is being dressed by the carpenters.  The carpenters will follow the pile driver very closely and the building will soon take form.</p>
                            <p>The lumber for the Art building has not arrived, but is expected within a day or two.</p>
                            <p>A few carpenters were working on the Nebraska building this morning, but the majority of the force were sitting about the red hot stove in one of the rooms on the main floor.  Foreman Knowles said that the building was far enough advanced so that a few days' delay would do no harm, and the men could rest as well as not, as their pay stopped when they were not working.</p>

Shawhan of Idaho writes from New Plymouth, that state, that his state will be represented at the exposition by a creditable exhibit, notwithstanding the legislature made no appropriation for an exhibit and the prominent people of the state have been rather apathetic about having the interests of the state properly represented.  Mr. Shawhan asks that the space set apart for Idaho, which the Department of Exhibits has been holding in reserve at his request, be held still longer, as he is positive that an exhibit will be made which will <choice><sic>propertly</sic><corr>properly</corr></choice> represent the extensive interests of the state.  He says he has had several interviews with the governor and that official has expressed a great interest in the matter and has promised his heart co-operation.  The governor will issue a call in a few days for a meeting to organize a commission to gather an exhibit to properly represent the state and Mr. Shawhan says he has good reason to believe that an energetic and capable commission will be organized which will collect an exhibit which will be a creditable addition to the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EXPOSITION MAY DRAW FROM THERE</head>
                            <head type="sub">George W. Fishback of Philadelphia Writes to the Department of Exhibits on a Question of Great Moment.</head>
                            <p>The way is opening for exhibits at the Transmississippi Exposition by the republics of South America, and the indications are that official exhibits will be made by the governments of those countries.  Among the exhibits which will probably be secured from this source is a mineral collection from the Argentine Republic which was at the World's fair, and which is said to be the finest collection of its kind in the world.  An offer of $100,000 for this collection was refused by the owner, who is the director of the Department of Mines of Argentine.</p>
                            <p>The opportunity to secure these South American exhibits comes to the exposition management through George W. Fishback, of Philadelphia, who has been in close touch with the officials of the republics of the southern continent.  He was a resident of the Argentine Republic for six years in an official capacity and visited all of the republics last year as the official representative of the Department of State to invite those governments to send delegates to the panamerican convention, which was held in Philadelphia last June.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Fishback writes to the Department of Exhibits that he is quite positive that if the governments of those countries were properly approached the Argentine Republic, Brazil, Chili and Peru would make government exhibits of their resources, including grains and other natural products and manufactured goods.  Argentine and Brazil, he says, could make fine exhibits of hard woods and all of the states could exhibit their manufactured products, giving the manufacturers of this country an intelligent idea of the competition they would have to meet in shipping goods to those countries.  He also says that he feels certain that he could arrange, through friends in the Argentine Republic, to secure the magnificent mineral collection which was exhibited at the World's fair, as a part of the mining exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition, as he has been informed that the owner of the collection is willing to allow it to be returned to this country with a view of its ultimate sale.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Fishback also makes several suggestions regarding amusement features which he says might be secured from these South American countries.  Among these he suggests a company of guachos, corresponding to the cowboys of the western plains, who could give an entertaining exhibition, showing how wild steers and ostriches are lassoed on the pampas of their native country.  He also refers to the national game of hand ball, corresponding to the national game of base ball, and says that a company of natives could give an interesting show by playing this game.</p>
                            <p>The suggestions outlines by Mr. Fishback will be given serious consideration by the Department of Exhibits and negotiations will be opened with the countries named with a view of securing these exhibits.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Men at the Exposition Grounds Hustle Lively to Keep Warm.</head>
                            <p>Workmen on the big buildings at the exposition grounds go at their labors with an energy that defies the rigors of the atmosphere.  While the early hours were very cold, the sun came out bravely and soon warmed the air to such an extent that working outside was not uncomfortable after 10 o'clock.  The snow flurry of Sunday did not deposit enough fleecy flakes to interfere with the workmen and the heavy timbers were shifted about with unusual energy in order to keep up a rapid circulation of blood.  There was little or no wind, and the temperature was not inconvenient.</p>
                            <p>Work on all of the main buildings is progressing in a satisfactory manner.  The Manufactures and Mines buildings are well advanced, the roofs of both being near completion.  When the skylights at the crowns of these roofs are in place the main roofs will be complete.  The windows of the Manufactures building are being put in place and the weather will soon be entirely shut out of this structure.</p>
                            <p>The trusses for the roofs of the Machinery, Liberal Arts and Agriculture buildings are being framed and all will be ready to raise within a short time. </p>
                            <p>The driving of the piles of the Government building was commenced this morning.  These are being driven without being peeled of their bark, and this, with the frozen condition of the ground, makes a little more work, but does not seriously delay the driving.  The lumber for this building is being delivered on the ground and is being dressed by the carpenters.  The carpenters will follow the pile driver very closely and the building will soon take form.</p>
                            <p>The lumber for the Art building has not arrived, but is expected within a day or two.</p>
                            <p>A few carpenters were working on the Nebraska building this morning, but the majority of the force were sitting about the red hot stove in one of the rooms on the main floor.  Foreman Knowles said the building was far enough advanced so that a few days' delay would do no harm, and the men could rest as well as not, as their pay stopped when they were not working.</p>

                            <p>Vice President B. P. Shawhan of Idaho writes from New Plymouth, that state, that his state will be represented at the exposition by a creditable exhibit, notwithstanding the legislature made no appropriation for an exhibit and the prominent people of the state have been rather apathetic about having the interests of the state properly represented.  Mr. Shawhan asks that the space set apart for Idaho, which the Department of Exhibits has been holding in reserve at his request, be held still longer, as he is positive that an exhibit will be made which will <choice><sic>propertly</sic><corr>properly</corr></choice> represent the extensive interests of the state.  He says he has had several interviews with the governor and that official has expressed a great interest in the matter and has promised his hearty co-operation.  The governor will issue a call in a few days for a meeting to organize a commission to gather an exhibit to properly represent the state and Mr. Shawhan says he has good reason to believe that an energetic and capable commission will be organized which will collect an exhibit which will be a creditable addition to the exposition.</p>

                            <p>Encouraging reports come from France regarding participation by that government in the Transmississippi and International Exposition.  The Chamber of Commerce has petitioned the president of the republic to consent to a government exhibit being made and it is the opinion of prominent United States representatives in France that the president will take favorable action in the matter and appoint a commission to see that the French government is properly represented at the exposition by an exhibit and also by official representatives.</p>
                            <p>Frederick Mayer, editor of The Nineteen Hundred, the official organ of the Paris exposition to be held in 1900, was appointed several weeks ago as commissioner from France for the Transmississippi and International Exposition, and he has taken an active part in arousing interest among the people of his country in the great exposition to be held in Omaha in 1898.  Through his influence and efforts the Chamber of Commerce has been induced to take official action looking toward representation on the part of the government, and he has also opened negotiations with several firms of prominence who were exhibitors at the World's fair and has secured promises from them that they will make exhibits at Omaha.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mayer has been assisted in his efforts by the American representatives in France and Consul General Goudy and Hon. Allison G. Bowen have expressed the opinion that the French section will be one of the most attractive portions of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The pamphlet of the exposition, issued by the Department of Publicity, has been translated into French by Mr. Mayer and published in the same form as the English edition now being circulated by the Publicity department.  The title page and cuts of the buildings are the same <choice><sic>ast hose</sic><corr>as those</corr></choice> used by the department.  This pamphlet is being circulated all over France by the energetic commissioner and he reports that good results are confidently expected.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Plans to Get Them to Visit the Big Show Next Year.</head>
                            <p>A mass meeting of the colored people of the city was held in St. Peter's Episcopal church last night for the purpose of planning ways and means by which the colored portion of the population of the transmississippi section of the country might be induced to attend the exposition next year.  The meeting was called by the Epworth League of the church and in response about seventy-five people were in attendance.  After considerable discussion it was thought best to establish a sort of bureau of information, through which the exposition will be advertised among the colored people by means of newspapers that reach them, and otherwise.  This bureau will also have the duty of providing lodging places for the visitors during their stay and will be also responsible for their entertainment.  These are the objects which the bureau is at present planning to carry out, but further duties will probably be assigned to it as the time of the exposition approaches.  The following committee was elected to bring the plan and scheme to the attention of the exposition directory: Dr. M. O. Ricketts, Rev. J. C. Owens, Rev. J. A. Williams, C. D. Bell and Dr. W. H. Stevens.</p>

                            <p>The people of Colorado are beginning to realize that they have lost much valuable time in making preparations for the exhibit which the state desires to make in the Horticultural building.  Mrs. Martha A. Shute, secretary of the State Horticultural society, in an interview quoted in a Denver paper, says:</p>
                            <p>It begins to look now as though our horticultural display will have to be shipped to Omaha as the fruit ripens next summer.  What should have been done this fall regarding our proposed display was to have selected, as the fruit ripened, about 400 barrels of the choicest fruits, and place them in cold storage, to be opened in the spring and shipped to Nebraska.  As it is now, we have not selected a single piece of fruit for our display.</p>
                            <p>Governor Adams has done his duty in appointing the Colorado board, but the superintendents of the various departments have not as yet been selected.  This is a mistake, as it only delays matters.  Of course, the lack of sufficient funds has been a great drawback, and may eventually materially affect our display, but the preliminary steps to shipping our exhibits should have been gone ahead with as soon as the state board was appointed.</p>

                            <p>The Mines building is the first of the exposition buildings to be equipped with the translucent fabric which is to be used for covering the skylights which are used in all of the big exhibit buildings.  This fabric is a flexible material, being a patent composition which is spread over a brass wire netting of small mesh.  The material is a rich amber color and sheds a soft light which is very agreeable to the eye and seems to penetrate every nook and corner.  From the floor of the building it has every appearance of stained glass, but it is regarded by the architects as being better than glass for the reason that it is not so fragile and is not affected by any settling or swaying of the building or by hail.  When this material is in place on the Mines building the entire roof will be closed in.</p>

                            <p>Frank Anderson, a carpenter employed on the Liberal Arts building, received slight injuries to his feet yesterday afternoon, by jumping from a ladder, which slipped and threatened to fall.  He was removed to his home near Albright and a physician found that some of the small bones of the feet had been broken and the tendons strained.  The physician and his patient would be confined to the house for two or three weeks.</p>
                            <p>Anderson was working at the west end of the building on a ladder about twenty feet from the ground.  The ladder slipped and to avoid falling with it Anderson jumped to the ground, alighting on his feet with a severe jar.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The Bureau of Education of the Transmississippi Exposition will at once take hold of the matter of organizing an educational congress to be held at Omaha during the exposition, at some date to be arranged later, the governing idea being that the date shall not conflict with that fixed for the meeting of the National Educational association.</p>
                            <p>This action of the Bureau of Education was taken at the meeting of the executive committee of the Woman's Board of Managers of the exposition held this morning, being the first regular meeting of the committee since the decision of the executive committee of the National Educational association, to hold the next meeting of the association in Washington.  The plan of organization of the Woman's Board of Managers provides that it shall have charge of the various congresses on educational and scientific subjects, and with this in view the women have been working on lines calculated to bring about various congresses of this kind.  They lent their aid in the work of attempting to secure the meeting of the National Educational association, taking the position that the meeting of such an organization would be in the nature of a congress, but as the failure to secure that meeting left a vacancy, it has been decided to take active steps to make other arrangements for an educational congress.</p>
                            <p>This topic formed the principal matter discussed at the meeting of the committee to day.  It was the unanimous opinion of all the members of the committee that the loss of the educational association meeting should not be allowed to interfere with the decision reached early in life of the board that an educational congress should be one of the congresses to be held in Omaha during the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The best means of bringing about this result formed the subject of a prolonged discussion by the committee.  It was recognized that the matter was an important one and that prompt action must be taken to set in motion such an extensive affair.  Little time was lost in deciding that the bureau would take up the task of organizing such a congress, the following resolution introduced by Mrs. Sawyer being adopted:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, It was expected that the National Educational association would take the place of an educational congress, and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, It has been decided by that organization not to hold its next session in Omaha; therefore, be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the Bureau of Education arrange for an educational congress in connection with the work of other congresses, and to this end requests the co-operation of all educational workers.</p>

                            <p>The form which the congress should take was discussed at length.  It developed that correspondence had been had with several associations of university professors and kindergartners, all of whom had manifested considerable interest in the matter.  It was the general opinion that this correspondence should be followed up.  The necessity for bringing the educational congress idea prominently before the state associations of teachers of the several states was also discussed, and it was the unanimous judgment of all the members of the committee that the Bureau of Education should be represented at the meeting of each state association, nearly all of which meet during the holiday season, so that the matte might be presented concisely and the co-operation of each association secured.  The members of the committee took a broad view of the matter and agreed that the congress should not be confined strictly to the transmississippi states, but should include states outside of that region, especially Wisconsin and Illinois.</p>
                            <p>The question of a plan was discussed quite freely but no definite conclusion was reached on the details and the matter was finally referred to the regular committee on congresses, comprising Mrs. Winona S. Sawyer of Lincoln, Mrs. J. R. Reed of Council Bluffs and Mrs. N. P. Feil of Omaha.  This committee was instructed to formulate a plan for the congress and report the same to an adjourned meeting of the executive committee to be held for that purpose next Wednesday.</p>
                            <p>The only other matter of importance passed upon by the committee was that of the location of the Girls' and Boy's building.  It was decided to take formal applications for the site at the northeast corner of the main court.  In the opinion of the committee this site is the most central point on the grounds and will be in a retired spot back of the colonnade leading from the Machinery and Electricity building to the main viaduct, where the children will be away from the crowd and where the building will be convenient for visitors.</p>

                            <p>The weather was decidedly frosty on the exposition grounds today.  The temperature hovered in the vicinity of zero all day and the brisk wind from the northwest was cold and biting in the extreme.  It had a penetrating quality which was exasperating and caused the workmen on the big buildings to swing their arms and stamp their feet with vigor and frequency.  The work moved along briskly, however, despite the severity of the weather.  The carpenters on the Liberal Arts building laid off for about an hour early in the morning and those on the Nebraska building did not start to work until noon, but on the other building no time was lost.</p>
                            <p>The trusses for the roof of the Machinery and Electricity building are being raised and the other work on this building is moving briskly.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The loss of the 1898 convention of the National Educational association to Washington, after there had been strong hopes on the part of those most interested that the convention might be secured for this city, is still a live topic of discussion among passenger men at local railway headquarters.  The railroaders resent the statement that the Omaha lines did not do as much to bring the convention to this city as the Washington lines did to take it to Washington.</p>
                            <p>Arthur B. Smith, assistant general passenger agent of the B. &amp; M., went over to Chicago last week and spent Saturday in working among the members of the executive committee which was to decide the location of the meeting.  He represented all the Omaha lines, and says that all the Omaha railroads have for the last six months put forth every effort to land the big meeting for this city.  He was not present at the meeting of the executive committee, because it was not open to outsiders, but he put in the day working among the members on the outside.  The Washington lines were represented by traveling passenger agents only.</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the selection of Washington, General Western Agent Nash of the Milwaukee says: "All the Omaha railroads did all they could to get the meeting here.  In my opinion it was lost to Washington because the National Educational association thought by holding it there it could get $2 out of every person who attended it.  The rate to Washington will probably be one fare plus $2, the $2 to go to the association.  If there is an open rate of one-fare to Omaha on account of the exposition the association could not easily make its $2 profit off every attendant.  I am in favor of a meeting of all western teachers here anyway.  The railroads would probably grant reduced rates, and the meeting would be as large, if not larger than the Washington <unclear/></p>

                            <p>General Passenger Agent Lomax of the Union Pacific say: "Our representatives have had instructions for the last six months to do everything for the Omaha meeting of the teachers, and I believe they have carried out their instructions.  Now that Washington has been selected I believe a meeting of western teachers here next year would be a good thing, and will do all in my power to help such a movement along."</p>
                            <p>General Agent Rutherford of the Rock Island's passenger department said: "The rake-off for the National Educational association is what did it.  At least it looks very much that way.  The rates here next year would be so low that any such profit to the association would be impossible.  A Transmississippi association of school teachers ought to be a good thing, and I believe an Omaha meeting here next year would be a great success."</p>
                            <p>A prominent passenger official who declined to be quoted said: "The $2 profit for the association, which seemed nearer in sight by going to Washington, was undoubtedly what <choice><sic>enfluenced</sic><corr>influenced</corr></choice> the association's executive committee.  Although the association could have had advantage of the lowest rates possible into Omaha the executive committee did not appear to want the lowest rates, but was looking after the treasury of the association instead.  The fact that the National Educational association held a meeting in Chicago during the World's fair and that the association at that time could not get the $2 rake-off because of the low rates in effect from all points into Chicago is what prejudiced the executive committee against Omaha during its exposition year.  A representative of a Washington railroad told me that the executive committee had secretly decided the question as long ago as last April in favor of Washington, and I should not be surprised if this were so.  The executive committee was not open to arguments in favor of any other city.  Every railroad line into Omaha has worked hard for this meeting, and Superintendent Pearse has done especially good work, but it was no use, for the question was fixed in advance of the Chicago meeting.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Superintendent Pearse and Commissioner Utt Call a Mass Meeting for Friday Night of All Persons Interested.</head>
                            <p>As a result of a conference this morning between Superintendent of Schools Pearse and Commissioner Utt of the Commercial club a mass meeting will be held at the Commercial club rooms on next Friday evening at 7:30 o'clock to consider plans for the Transmississippi Educational congress which it is proposed to hold in this city during the exposition in accordance with the suggestion made by The Bee.</p>
                            <p>The plan has aroused so much favorable interest in the city generally that it was deemed advisable to make the arrangements early.  Speedy action is necessary also, from the fact that the different state educational associations in the western country will hold their annual meetings during the holidays and the matter of holding the congress must be presented to them at that time to secure their endorsement.</p>
                            <p>At the coming mass meeting the leading educators of Lincoln, South Omaha, Council Bluffs and this city will be invited to be present.  Among these will be Chancellor MacLean of the University of Nebraska and State Superintendent Jackson, if their presence can possible be secured.  Prominent business and professional men will also be in attendance.  A general invitation is extended to the public to be present.</p>
                            <p>At this meeting the time for holding the congress will probably be selected.  The date will not conflict in any way with the National Educational association session in Washington.  The idea of having it at the same time the Indian institute meets is being considered, since it is believed that the latter meeting will furnish a special inducement to western teachers and to some eastern ones to attend.</p>
                            <p>Both Secretary Utt and Superintendent of Schools Pearse are of the opinion that the congress will be considered favorably by the various state educational associations.  With the matter brought up before them and so acted upon there is no question that a big number of the teachers in the west will attend.  Superintendent Pearse figures that 6,000 can be brought to this city easily.</p>
                            <p>In speaking about the matter Secretary Utt stated this morning that there was no intention on the part of Omaha to detract in any way from the Washington meeting.  This is indicated by the fact that the date will be so fixed that it will not conflict.  But he said that there were many thousands of teachers in the west who were desirous of attending the exposition and others who could not afford to go to Washington and these would be accommodated by the congress in this city.</p>
                            <p>It is too early yet to say in just what manner the teachers will be entertained at the congress.  It is the general plan, however, to have an educational program as extensive and as interesting as the one at the national association meeting.  This matter, however, will be arranged in the</p>

                            <p>The first definite steps in the direction of the Transmississippi Educational Congress will be taken at a mass meeting which will be held at the Commercial club rooms this evening.  The idea has been received with marked enthusiasm and it is expected that the meeting will be largely attended.  In discussing the question of organization should be effected at tonight's meeting.  A president and secretary should be elected and also such committee as might be necessary to undertake the preliminary arrangements.  The teachers' associations of the transmississippi states will meet during holiday week and Mr. Utt contends that the matter should be pushed in order that some definite proposition might be made at these conventions.  A circular letter should be sent at once to all the prominent educator of the scheme and asking them to co-operate in making it a success.  He thinks if these men can be brought into line before the teachers' conventions meet their influence will be invaluable in securing the desired action by the state associations.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Pearse of the public schools has no definite suggestions to offer, as he says that matter has been largely left to Mr. Utt.  He suggests, however, that it would be well to understand at the outset that to organize an educational congress that would compare with the annual convention of the National Educational association is a very serious undertaking.  The national association expended from $10,000 to $12,000 at each meeting outside of what is contributed by the city in which the convention is held, and it would require a considerable expenditure of money as well as energetic effort to carry out the transmississippi enterprise on the scope which has been suggested.</p>

The first will be a measure to correct the administrative failures of the bill appropriating $200,000 for the exposition giving right to issue medals and recognizing the international scope of the Omaha fair.  The second will ask for an appropriation of $100,000 to make an Indian exhibit showing the aborigines as they primarily existed, and their present grade of civilization.  The bill will be so drawn that it will permit the use of money not wholly needed for the assemblage of representatives of the Indian tribes at Omaha to be used for other governmental purposes in strengthening the exhibit and completing the government building as originally planned.  This bill will be referred to the committee on Indian affairs in the senate, of which Senator Allen is a member.  Congressman Mercer will have charge of both bills in the house and will ask for a corresponding reference.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Wilson of the Agricultural department held a conference today with the heads of the different bureaus of his department relative to an exhibit to be made at the Omaha exposition.  It developed during the meeting that many of the chiefs are opposed to exhibiting at the Transmississippi Exposition.  They declare that not enough money and space have been given to them to make a creditable showing and that appropriations of larger amounts have been given to other departments which could not possibly give as interesting an exhibit as the Department of Agriculture.  In spite of this feeling, the secretary announced that a creditable exhibit must be made and the chiefs of the bureaus were instructed to give Omaha the very best display possible.</p>

Mr. Fishback has lived in those countries a number of years and has had much official business with the governments as the representative of this country, and he is confident that large and interesting exhibits can be secured from them.</p>
                            <p>George H. Wallace, acting governor of New Mexico in the absence of Governor Otero, has notified the Department of Exhibits that he has appointed a new exposition commission for the territory, but he fails to notify the department of their names.  He says, however, that the new commission will get together at once and will be active in having the interests of the state properly represented.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Carpenters Give Up the Fight, but the Pile Drivers Go Merrily On in Despite of the Weather.</head>
                            <p>Work on the exposition grounds is practically at a standstill today and the soft mantle of fleecy snowflakes settles quietly down over the bare timbers and partially completed buildings.  The main court looks like a deserted city, half buried in the snow.  The wind whistles through the timbers and drifts the snow in huge piles undisturbed, save by a few lonely pedestrians who wearily plodded through the snow underfoot, while the icy particles which filled the air lodged in the eyes and hair and seemed to possess the penetrating power of an X ray.</p>
                            <p>The lagoon is filled with snow, which drifted against the upright sides of the canal and Mirror, and twisted and whirled up and down the ice in a ghostly fashion.  The water, which has been flowing into the lagoon from the pipe of the island, was frozen into a huge stalactite, but the artesian well continued to do business at the old stand, the water smoking and steaming as it emerged from the iron pipe and dropped into the chilly waters of the canal.</p>
                            <p>Inside the big buildings all is covered with snow, which settled down quietly, covering everything to a depth of a couple of inches.  Not a carpenter was working on any of the buildings except the Auditorium, and only about a dozen men were working there.  A few staff men were working inside the Manufactures building putting up a scaffolding preparatory to plastering the interior of the clear story.  The piledriver for the Government building was working away regardless of the weather, but otherwise the grounds and buildings were deserted.</p>
                            <p>On the Bluff tract a few men were engaged in covering the roots of the trees just transplanted, putting live manure about the roots to prevent freezing.  The Nebraska building was deserted and the men who have been working in the trenches laying water mains were conspicuous by their absence.</p>
                            <p>The only place about the grounds where any activity was displayed was in the staff shop in the Mines building.  These men were all busy making the plaster casts for the main buildings and carrying it out in the snow as fast as completed.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles of the exposition received the following telegram yesterday afternoon from Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion who is in Washington in consultation with the various cabinet officers regarding the interests of the Transmississippi Exposition:</p>
                            <p>Have succeeded in inducing the War department to grant to our management the exclusive free use of Fort Omaha and all the buildings thereon during the exposition for the use of our association.  Recommend that formal application for a license for the grounds to be forwarded to the secretary of war by the first mail.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles said he did not understand exactly the idea Mr. Rosewater had in view in securing the use of these grounds, but presumed it was in connection with the mobilization of the militia of the country, a scheme upon which the Promotion department has been working vigorously ever since the idea was suggested in an article appearing in the The Bee last March outlining the scheme.  The old quarters on the reservation, with a few repairs and some cleaning, could be made to answer very well for quarters for the state or national troops, and the land constituting the reservation would afford camping ground for a large body of troops, while the vacant land in that vicinity would allow of an encampment of a large force.</p>
                            <p>The suggestion for making a formal request for the use of the old fort will be laid before the executive committee tomorrow and the formal request will be forwarded to Washington.</p>

                            <p>F. F. Ford, who is in Pennsylvania in the interest of the Department of Exhibits, writes from Philadelphia that he has had a number of interviews with John H. Converse, president of the Philadelphia Manufacturers' club and also president of the Baltimore Locomotive works.  He reports that Mr. Converse has manifested considerable interest in the exposition and has promised to make an exhibit of locomotives and other railway supplies manufactured by his company, and has also indicated the steps to be taken to enlist the interest of the Manufacturers' club in the matter of making an exhibit.  Mr. Converse has also promised to use his influence with the governor of Pennsylvania to appoint a state commission to look after the state's interests in the exposition and arrange for making a state exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ford reports that the people of Pennsylvania are interested in having their state take an active part in the exposition and he anticipates little difficulty in organizing a movement that will result in the appointment of a commission similar to the one now in active operation in New Jersey.</p>
                            <p>An exhibit of models of the battleships of the United States navy is one of the exhibits which Mr. Ford reports he has every reason to believe will be secured for the exposition.  He says he has had several interviews with the head of the great shipbuilding firm of William Cramp &amp; Sons, who has promised to get together the models of these ships which were exhibited at the World's fair and send them to Omaha as an interesting exhibit to the people of the inland states.  A collection of models of ocean liners is also promised by the International Navigation company of Philadelphia.</p>

At the close of the exposition it is the intention of the Woman's board to distribute these books among the schools of the transmississippi states in the same manner as the pictures in the children's building will be distributed, that is, by awarding one picture to the school which contributes the greatest amount of money per pupil, based on the enrollment; another picture to the school next in order, and so on to the end of the list of pictures.  The books in the library will be distributed according to the same plan, the details to be arranged later.</p>

                            <p>The people of Omaha must not be permitted to under-estimate the responsibility which they have assumed in connection with the location of the Transmississippi Exposition of 1898 in this city.  While the exposition is neither a local nor a state enterprise, but an interstate and international affair, Omaha and everybody who lives in Omaha or who has property interests in Omaha has voluntarily imposed an extra task upon himself.  The first work is that of preparation and the second that of entertainment.</p>
                            <p>The work of preparation for the exposition is both public and private.  The exposition association has charge of the construction of exhibition buildings and the collection and arrangement of exhibits, but it must have the individual co-operation of everyone interested in its success.  The city and county authorities are expected to put the streets, parks, public buildings and public places in the best possible condition, but to accomplish this they must be freed from friction and obstruction on the part of short-visioned taxpayers and penurious property owners.  The franchised corporations must improve their various services at short notice with the least possible inconvenience to the public.</p>
                            <p>For the work of entertainment all the clubs, associations and class organizations of business men, professional men and workingmen will have to be enlisted.  If each of the numerous organizations of this character does its full share the burden upon any one of them will be comparatively small.  To effect this, some plan of operations will have to be laid out and adopted in advance and an assignment of the different kinds of work made to the different clubs and associations.</p>
                            <p>If the work preliminary to the exposition is carefully carried out within the prescribed time limit, there will be no difficulty whatever in caring for all our exposition year guests and providing a varied entertainment that will make <unclear/></p>

                            <head type="sub">COUNTY COMMISSIONERS FEEL GOOD</head>
                            <head type="sub">Some Time Will Elapse Before the Issues Are Delivered&#8212;State Buys the Exposition Bonds at a Premium.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The county commissioners are feeling pretty good over the sale of the funding and exposition bonds, but as yet they have not considered the disposition of the proceeds.</p>
                            <p>It will be some time before the money from the sale of the bonds will pass into the county treasury, as there is considerable work to be performed.  The bonds must be lithographed, and this will take at least two weeks.  Then they must be filled out and signed by the chairman of the board and the county clerk, which will also require some time.  When that is done, it is expected that after registration the money from the sale of the exposition bonds will be turned over.  It is contended that with reference to these bonds there will not be any examination of the law required, as Attorney General Smyth looked into all of the questions involved before purchasing.</p>
                            <p>Regarding the funding bonds the county clerk will make a copy of the law authorizing the voting of the bonds, the election returns and the proceedings of the county commissioners in connection with their advertisement and sale.  This information will be sent on to the purchasers, who, if they find everything legal, will return the money.</p>
                            <p>As the matter now stands the commissioners figure that the money arising from the sale of the exposition bonds will be in the county treasury within three weeks, but with reference to the funding bonds they do not look for the proceeds much before the middle of January next.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">STATE BUYS THE BONDS.</head>
                            <p>At the afternoon session of the county commissioners Wednesday, the members examined Auditor Tate's tabulation of the bids for the bonds and decided that Farson, Leach &amp; Co. were the best bidders for the funding bonds, they having offered par and a premium of $15,327 for the issue of $180,000.  The award was made to this firm and their representative accepted the bonds, payment to be made upon the signing and registering.</p>
                            <p>On the $100,000 of exposition bonds, the board found that E. H. Fudge was the best bidder, he having offered par and a premium of $7,670.  The award was accordingly made, but the bidder refused to take the bunch, saying that he desired both funding and exposition bonds or none.  This refusal left Spitzer &amp; Co. the next highest bidders, their offer being par and a premium of $7,225.  Like Fudge, they refused to accept, contending that if they could not have the entire $280,000, they would not take any.  The First National bank of Chicago came in next, this concern being represented by Fudge, who had bid a premium of $6,850.  To this bank the award was made, but Fudge would not have it that way.  At this point the State of Nebraska through its attorney general, C. J. Smyth, came to the relief of the county commissioners and raised his former bid of $1,050, agreeing to pay the same price as had been offered by the First National bank of Chicago, par and a premium of $6,850, thus making the total sale aggregate a premium of $22,177.</p>
                            <p>After adjournment the commissioners said that in their opinion it was the best bond sale ever made in the state.  They figured that with the premiums paid it reduced the interest on the funding bonds to 3¾ per cent and on the exposition bonds to about 4 per cent in addition to saving the expense of exchange and expressage on the latter bonds.  Having been bought by the state, the commissioners assert that the interest and principal of the exposition bonds will be payable here instead of at some fiscal agency in the east.</p>

                            <p>Attorney General Smyth said that he would have taken the funding bonds if there had been available funds in the state treasury with which to have made the purchase.  He said that the bonds were considered a gilt-edged investment, due to the fact that the security was of the best and also that there was no option by which they could become due and payable at the end of ten years.  The conditions of the bonds are such that they must run the full twenty years before payment can be made.</p>
                            <p>The eastern representatives said that they had attended a large number of bond sales during the last three months and that this sale was the best that they knew of.  They said that Nebraska, and Douglas county especially, stands well in the financial circles of the east and that its securities were eagerly sought.</p>
                            <p>One of the bidders said that if the bonds had been offered at auction they would have brought a much larger premium than was obtained.  He also said that in judgment the bonds would have brought a premium if the interest had been as low as 4 per cent.</p>
                            <p>The county commissioners congratulated themselves <unclear/></p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 1.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;This has been another busy day for those promoting the Transmississippi Exposition in the departments.  Mr. Rosewater had a long interview with Postmaster General Gary in relation to a commemorative stamp for the exposition.  Mr. Gary at first was opposed to the scheme of issuing a stamp on account, as he thought, of the non-international character of the exposition.  It was shown to him that the act of congress made the show international and that the president had directed that invitations be sent to foreign governments to participate in the Omaha fair.  This placed a somewhat different light upon the question and Postmaster General Gary finally agreed to sanction the issuance of a commemorative stamp if the State department would certify to the international scope of the exposition.  This was all Mr. Rosewater had asked for and before the day was over he had a strong letter from Assistant Secretary Day of the State department, addressed to the postmaster general, wherein it was stated that all foreign governments had been asked to participate in the Transmississippi Exposition and many had accepted.  This, it is expected, will complete the negotiations for the issuance of commemorative stamps.</p>

                            <p>In an interview Secretary Bliss of the Interior department informed Mr. Rosewater that he would do everything possible in a departmental way to secure an Indian exhibit on the grounds, showing the manner in which the Indians live and perform their labors, the manufacture of native blankets, jewelry, pottery, etc.  While the secretary thought the scope of the Indian congress as originally planned was entirely out of the question, he intimated that he would co-operate if necessary in securing an appropriation for the transportation and subsistence of the Indians during the progress of the exposition.  Acting Commissioner of Indian Affairs Tanner, after the matter was explained to him, not only pledged the help of the department, but personally volunteered to do everything possible to make a success of bringing together representatives of many of the Indian tribes at Omaha, to be in the immediate charge of a government representative.  To show accomplishments of this kind it is believed will wonderfully increase not only the picturesqueness of the exposition, but make it invaluable from an ethnological standpoint.</p>
                            <p>Governor Otero of New Mexico stated to Mr. Rosewater today that he had appointed a new commission for the Omaha exposition, which would act, and a New Mexico exhibit might be expected.</p>
                            <p>Welling G. Sickel, mayor of Trenton, N. J., said today that his state would make a fine exhibit at Omaha.  "We have twenty-three potteries in Trenton, besides rubber factories, wire works, lamp manufactories," said Mr. Russell, "and when exhibits from these various institutions are assembled it will make a most novel and interesting show.  Trenton is the Staffordshire of America, making more pottery than any other section of the country, and we are all enthusiastically pulling for Omaha in 1898."</p>

                            <p>The Mines and Mining buildings will be the third of the big exposition buildings to be covered with staff.  The staging for the staff men is being put in place and the ornamental castings will soon be placed on the outer walls of the building.  This work can be done as well in freezing weather as at any other time, the only drawback being that the joints and nailholes cannot be "pointed up" in freezing weather, neither can the plaster be put on the plain surfaces, but as the putting on of the ornamental stucco is by far the greatest part of the work, the other details give the staff contractors little uneasiness.</p>
                            <p>Smith &amp; Eastman, the contractors who have the staff work on all of the main buildings except the Liberal Arts, have a large force of men at work in their new shop in the big Mines building, and are turning out the big pieces of ornamental work at a rapid rate.  The molds for all of the buildings have now been completed and the work of casting can be pushed with the greatest rapidity.  The making of models and molds is slow work and cannot be pushed successfully, but these preliminaries are all disposed of and the finished casts are being piled up inside the Mines building at an astonishing rate.</p>
                            <p>All through the day there is almost a continuous procession of workmen carrying the completed casts out of the workshop and standing them against the walls or posts of <unclear/>ding, where they smoke like a casting of iron fresh from the mold.  These casts are "green," not having dried out.  They have "set" and are hard, but there is considerable water in them and this soon freezes until the cast is like a piece of ice.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith, sr., member of the firm of Smith &amp; Eastman, has been in the staff and stucco business for about thirty years, having in that time finished the interior of a large number of important public buildings, among them being the immense headquarters of the State, War and Navy departments of the federal government at Washington, one of the largest buildings of its kind in the world.  He says that the freezing of the staff casts does not injure them in the least, as they will slowly dry out when the weather is warm enough, and they can be handled just as well when frozen as at any other time, the only disagreeable feature about handling them when in that condition being that they are like so many pieces of ice and are consequently very cold.</p>
                            <p>A large portion of the decorative work for the Mines and Agriculture buildings has been cast and the staff workers are now engaged in making some of the work for the Machinery building.</p>

                            <p>A telegram from Port Townsend, Wash., states that Collector of Customs Heustis has been instructed by the Treasury department that a concession for a Chinese exhibit has been granted Wong Chin Foo at the Transmississippi Exposition and that he has been authorized by the department to bring into this country 250 Chinamen for exposition purposes.  Mr. Heustis announces that every Chinamen coming to this country under this concession will be examined on board ship in the harbor and all who cannot show that they are connected with the exposition will be returned by the next steamer.</p>
                            <p>This order to the collector at Port Townsend removes the last bar to the bringing of these Chinamen into the United States and Wong Chin Foo will probably arrive in Omaha with his countrymen from the northern part of China within a short time.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Secretary Ford of the Woman's Board of Managers Talks of the Plans and Work Needed for Success.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>"The movement to secure an educational congress in Omaha during the exposition, in which everybody seems to be taking such an interest, is directly in line with the course which has been pursued by the Woman's Board of the exposition since it was first organized," said Mrs. F. M. Ford, the secretary of the board.  "We have been working all the time on the theory that an educational congress would be one of the leading events in connection with the exposition.  If the meeting of the National Educational association had been secured that would have occupied the place of such a congress, but the board has never considered the probability of there not being an educational congress, regardless of whether the National Educational association should meet in Omaha or elsewhere.  With this end in view we have been in correspondence with prominent educators in various lines of work all over the country and have made it plain to them that such a congress would be held, that the meeting of the National Educational association would be regarded as a congress, because we would not ask the people interested in educational matters to come here to attend the convention of this association and then come again to attend an educational congress.  The replies we have received from these people clearly indicate that they have understood the matter that way and, almost without exception, they have promised to co-operate in every possible way.</p>
                            <p>"The members of the executive committee of the Woman's board are highly gratified at the manner in which the various interests in Omaha are taking hold of this matter.  The women feel that the organization of such a congress is a gigantic undertaking and they hesitate to undertake the tremendous responsibility involved, but with the commercial and educational interests at their back they feel encouraged to undertake the task.</p>

                            <head type="sub">THEIR PLAN IN DETAIL.</head>
                            <p>"What the women intend, in a general way," continued the secretary, "is to outline a broad plan and provide for the appointment of a committee of prominent educators to work out the details and put the plan into execution.  We have a committee on congresses under the plan of organization of the Woman's board and this committee will outline the general plan of all congresses so that they will not conflict in any way, but this committee cannot undertake the huge task of carrying out the organization of these different congresses or even of arranging the minute details, because this requires experts in each line of work; but the committee will have a general supervision over all to the extent of guarding against cross-purposes.  This committee will meet Monday afternoon of next week to take this matter up and outline a plan.  When this has been done no time will be lost in putting this plan into operation in order to reach all of the state educational associations.  The majority of these associations hold their meetings in the holiday season and the desire of the Woman's board is to have a personal representative at each of these meetings to present the matter, besides enlisting the interests of the officers and prominent members of the association by letters and other means.</p>
                            <p>"We shall be very glad of the assistance of any committee that may be appointed as the result of the mass meeting which has been called for Friday night, or to receive any suggestions from any source in connection with the matter.  What we are working for is the interests of the exposition and the success of the proposed congress, and we don't make any pretension of knowing it all.  The people of Omaha or of any other point who are interested in the exposition should have as much interest in the success of this movement as the members of the Woman's board, and was have only taken initiative because the plan under which the board is organized requires us to look after such matters and the exposition management has expected that of the board."</p>

                            <p>The mass meeting which is to be held at the Commercial club tomorrow night to make the preliminary arrangements for the Transmississippi Educational congress during the exposition promises to be a lively one, judging from the indications that are now being given.  Secretary Utt of the Commercial club, who is engineering the movement in conjunction with Superintendent Pearse of the public schools, is of the opinion that the attendance will be large.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="137" xml:id="TMISB03-137"/>
                            
                            <p>A very commendable feature of the matter is that it is being taken up with considerable enthusiasm by the business men of the city.  Although it was suggested but a few days ago by The Bee it appealed at once to the business interests and the result was an endorsement by the Commercial club.  Since that time the idea was spread out among the business people throughout the city and has been enthusiastically received.</p>
                            <p>But while tomorrow night's meeting will be attended by a goodly number of business men, the attendance will be no means be thus confined.  The matter of the congress appeals to every citizen who has the success of the exposition at heart, since it will bring thousands to the city besides being a prominent western educational movement.  There will therefore be room in the meeting for every class of people to speak their minds as to the manner in which the congress should be planned.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Utt is sending out the following invitations:</p>
                            <p>You are respectfully invited to attend a meeting at these rooms next Friday, December 3, 1897, at 7:30 p. m., for the purpose of considering the organization to be called the Transmississippi Educational Congress.</p>
                            <p>Providing this movement can be placed on a proper footing and executed, it will be a great affair, and it is hoped you will be present at this particular meeting; also, you are at liberty to invite any person you desire that you think would have an interest in the undertaking.</p>

                            <p>This committee is to consist of three persons, one from Omaha, one from Council Bluffs and one from Lincoln.  The Omaha member is Will Morris; the other two have not been appointed, but they will be named by the members of the executive committee of the Woman's board for the two cities, Mrs. Reed for Council Bluffs and Mrs. Sawyer for Lincoln.  The designs will be submitted to the committee on their merits.  The names of the designers will not be made known to the committee until after the selection has been made.</p>

                            <p>The gate keepers at the exposition grounds have been made happy by the erection of sentry boxes in which they may take refuge from the cold and perform their duties at the same time.  These boxes are 4x6 feet in size and are let into the fence in such a way that the gate keeper can see persons or teams approaching from any direction.  By an ingenious arrangement the small gate for foot passengers can be opened without leaving the box.  These little houses are heated by a tiny stove, which holds about a thimbleful of coal, but they send out heat enough to make the interior like a turkish bath when the attendant forgets to close the draft.</p>

                            <p>If a resolution introduced at the meeting of the Board of County Commissioners by Chairman Stenberg this morning is adopted when it comes up for consideration at the regular meeting of the board next Saturday, the Transmississippi Exposition will be benefited to the extent of $75,000 by the issue of $100,000 of exposition bonds authorized by the voters of <choice><sic>oDuglas</sic><corr>Douglas</corr></choice> county at the last election, and for which the county has realized the sum of $106,850.</p>
                            <p>The resolution referred to is a lengthy and exhaustive recital of the circumstances surrounding the creation of the bonded indebtedness on account of the exposition, reviewing the creation of the exposition association; the fact that the association is now erecting buildings for exhibition, the names of <choice><sic>whic</sic><corr>which</corr></choice> are given, which are much more attractive than anything Douglas county could hope to erect with the money at hand; that it is the intention of the association to construct other buildings, among them being the Horticultural, Dairy and <choice><sic>Apairy</sic><corr>Apiary</corr></choice> buildings, which have been located on the most desirable sites, so that no site could be selected by the county on the main portion of the grounds for a county building; that the rules of the association do not permit of the erection of exhibit buildings by counties or states; and that the exposition management has expended large sums of money in beautifying the grounds and has manifested a willingness to permit Douglas county to make its exhibit in the respective buildings according to the rules of classification for said buildings.  Then follows this resolution:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That in consideration of the said exposition company giving and granting to the county of Douglas for the purpose of making a proper exhibit, a reasonable space in said buildings hereinbefore described, to be determined by the Board of County Commissioners, that it is the judgment of the Board of County Commissioners of Douglas county, state of Nebraska, that the proceeds arising from the sale of said bonds to the amount of $75,000 be and the same is hereby directed to be applied and appropriated as follows:</p>

                            <head type="sub">Attendance Limited, but the Outlines of the Project Are Drawn and Another Meeting Called for Tonight.</head>
                            <p>On account of the inclemency of the weather last night there was a small attendance at the mass meeting at the Commercial club, called for the purpose of arranging for a Transmississippi Educational congress in this city during the exposition.  In the way of preliminaries Superintendent Pearse was named as chairman of a committee of nine to work up the sentiment among western teachers.  An adjournment was taken until this evening at 7:30 o'clock, when another mass meeting to consider the <unclear/></p>
                            <p>Although the attendance was light, local educators were well represented, there being present State Superintendent of Schools Jackson of Lincoln, Superintendent of Schools Pearse, Secretary Gillon of the school board, Prof. Leviston of the High school and Instructors Allen, Reid and Bernstein of the public schools.  There were also present Victor Rosewater of The Omaha Bee, Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Harford of the Exposition Board of Women Managers and Secretary John E. Utt of the Commercial club.</p>
                            <p>The meeting organized by electing Superintendent Pearse as chairman.  After an informal discussion of the situation J. M. Gillan moved the appointment of an executive committee of five, later amended to nine, to manage the scheme.  Another discussion followed and the motion then carried.  Superintendent Pearse was made chairman of the committee and was empowered to appoint his fellow members.</p>
                            <p>According to a suggestion by Victor Rosewater, this committee will have a wide field to work, its early duties being of a campaigning nature.  Its work will be largely by correspondence to work up sentiment in the west in favor of congress.  Incidentally Mr. Rosewater suggested that it would be well for the State university faculty to start the ball rolling by passing resolutions in favor of the congress.  This resolution could be followed by others from the State Educational society, which meets this month, and then similar resolutions should be presented to other state bodies.  All these state associations should be also asked to contribute to a joint committee on program.  The arrangements for the material and physical part of the convention must be made by a local committee.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater also said that he had no doubt that the business organizations would give the same assurances of aid to the present scheme as they had given when an effort was being made to get the National Educational association.  The Commercial club had agreed to furnish a bureau of information and proper entertainment committees.  The Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben had offered their big hall for the congress and other halls for overflow meetings.  The exposition directory had also promised to assume its share of the burden of looking after the convention.  Mr. Rosewater believed not only that these assurances would be offered again, but that these bodies would exert all their influence to attract the teachers.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Pearse pointed out the necessity of arranging a program upon which educators of national reputation would be represented by papers.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Utt of the Commercial club urged the necessity of interesting the railroads.  He was very sanguine that thousands of teachers could be induced to come to the city to attend the congress and the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Chancellor MacLean of the University of Nebraska could not attend last night's meeting on account of another engagement, but he will be here tonight and with him are expected other members of the faculty of the university.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Senator Allen has sent Secretary Bliss an interesting letter regarding the proposed congress of Indian families at Omaha next year.  He invites suggestions from the secretary along lines that the greatest good may result from this educational feature at the Transmississippi Exposition.  The senator has also written the president of the Indian Rights association for suggestions.  In his letter to Secretary Bliss, Senator Allen says: "Within the borders of our land live many tribes whose quaint habits and methods of life have remained unchanged since the days of Columbus, and whose characteristics are less known, even to our own people, than those of the tribes of Central Africa and Asia, and these people are sufferers in many respects by reason of their ignorance of our people."</p>
                            <p>It is the intention of the secretary of agriculture to have a bill passed by congress between now and the Christmas holidays appropriating $10,000 to erect a plant on the grounds of the Transmississippi Exposition, to show the processes of the manufacture of the sugar beet into a staple article.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>St. Louis merchants and manufacturers are beginning to wake up to the necessity of being creditably represented at the Transmississippi and International Exposition in 1898.  R. W. Richardson is at present in that city working in the interest of the exposition and has succeeded in getting many of the leading men of St. Louis to look into the matter.  The first important step was taken Wednesday night at a meeting called to consider the matter.  Of this meeting the Globe-Democrat contains the following report:</p>
                            <p>A meeting of merchants and manufacturers was held at the Furniture Board of Trade headquarters in the Century building last night to consider the proposition to make displays at the Transmississippi and International Exposition at Omaha, Neb., next year.  L. D. Kingsland was called to the chair and Tom L. Cannon of the Manufacturers' association was made secretary.  The Merchants' exchange was represented by C. H. Sampson, Chris Sharpe and H. R. Whitmore; the Business Men's league by Frank Gaiennie; the paint, oil and drug clerks by G. P. Murrill and M. H. Stearns; Implement Dealers' association by John P. Camp; Merchants' Transportation association by E. S. Lewis; Furniture Board of Trade by J. A. J. Shultz, Newton Holthaus and R. L. McEwen; railroads, H. R. Todd; boot and shoe houses, John Mueller; bond brokers, George C. Edwards, Ben Altheimer and W. H. Moore; Manufacturers' association, L. D. Kingsland, T. A. Meysenburg and Joseph Wangler, and Real Estate exchange, Paul Jones.</p>
                            <p>R. W. Richardson, a commissioner of the exposition, was in attendance.  He gave some explanations respecting the management of the enterprise and urged the assemblage to make exhibits.  A Mr. Gibbons, also of Omaha, spoke briefly of the proposed exposition.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Richardson exhibited a letter from the Anheuser-Busch Brewing association, indicating that the concern had decided to make a finer display than at the World's fair at Chicago.  C. H. Sampson was called upon, but he expressed a desire to hear from representatives of the Merchants' exchange.  He considered it imperative on the St. Louis business men to make a creditable display at this exposition.</p>
                            <p>T. A. Meysenburg expressed the belief that only general features could be discussed and suggested that the matter be given into the hands of committees.</p>
                            <p>J. A. J. Shultz said that his firm had already secured space in the exposition and invited other firms to join.</p>
                            <p>Frank Gaiennie said that the city of St. Louis could not afford to be without representation in the exposition, and that the business men must see to it that the city was properly represented.</p>
                            <p>Frank Gaiennie offered a resolution that the city be represented at the Omaha exposition and that the merchants and manufacturers be urged and invited to make exhibits, and that the city or state be represented by a suitable building to be used as headquarters.</p>
                            <p>This, however, was withdrawn when the following resolution was offered by H. R. Whitmore:</p>
                            <p>"Recognizing in the Transmississippi and International Exposition an opportunity for the manufacturing and other business interests of St. Louis to reach the trade of the great and growing west, and realizing the obligation resting upon the metropolis of the Mississippi valley to support every public enterprise calculated to increase its trade and promote its interests;</p>
                            <p>"Resolved, That we heartily recommend this exposition to the patronage of our merchants and manufacturers, and appeal to the civic pride of our citizens to use their best efforts to secure a full exhibit of all our varied industries.</p>
                            <p>"Resolved, That we hereby request the Manufacturers' association, which has so creditably taken the initiative in this matter, and which so largely represents those most interested in its success, to take such further action as may seem best calculated to secure such a display as shall reflect credit both upon our city and its varied industries; and in this effort we pledge the hearty co-operation of the respective organizations which we represent.</p>
                            <p>"Resolved, That the assistance of the press is hereby solicited in awakening a public interest and setting forth the advantages which will accrue to our city and state through full representation in this laudable enterprise."</p>
                            <p>This was unanimously adopted.</p>
                            <p>Owen Miller offered a motion that a committee of five persons be appointed to take charge of the movement and propose a plan of action.</p>
                            <p>This also was adopted, and the chairman announced that he would appoint the committee within a few days.</p>
                            <p>The meeting adjourned subject to the call of the chair.</p>

                            <p>MILWAUKEE, Dec. 3.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;E. G. Mullen, a well known lumberman, who is an intimate friend of General Scofield, has an idea for the Wisconsin building at the Omaha Exposition that will arouse considerable interest among lumbermen of the state and may be adopted.  Mr. Mullen's plan is that Wisconsin be represented by a building which would, in its material and construction, represent in some more or less direct way the industries of the state.  Mr. Mullen thinks that a lumber camp would at once represent one of the greatest among the industries that made the state what it is and be an edifice so different from the usual exposition building that it would interest the public much more than a conventional structure.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>A meeting of the board of managers of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture has been called at the Millard hotel in this city December 7.  The chief interest of the session is connected with a recent threat of the board to repudiate the contract with the Omaha Fair and Speed association and President W. R. Bennett of the association has been notified that the matter will be taken up at that time.  The first notice that the members of the Fair and Speed association received of the intention of the state board to begin hostilities was contained in a letter from J. B. Dinsmore, which was received by President Bennett about three weeks ago.  This sets forth the position of the board at length, and is as follows:</p>
                            <p>SUTTON, Neb., Nov. 8, 1897.&#8212;W. R. Bennett, Esq., President Omaha Fair and Speed Association, Omaha: Dear Sir&#8212;The fair has now been held in Omaha for three years.  There has at all times been more or less complaint on the part of patrons that the facilities to get back and forth from the grounds were poor.  The proposition submitted on the part of Omaha at the time the fair was located on its present site stated ample facilities, street car and steam car, would be afforded for the conveyance of <choice><sic>100,00 0people</sic><corr>100,000 people</corr></choice> per day to the grounds, that a rate of fare upon street and steam rail ways should be 5 cents each way; both of these propositions have failed in compliance.  During the fair that has been held in your city in the last three years at no time have there been 100,000 people all told on the grounds, and for the handling of these in five days the transportation facilities have been inadequate.  Further, there has never been on the part of the city of Omaha a sufficiently liberal patronage to justify the statements made at the time of the location of the fair as to what might be expected from the people of that city.  When the fair was located in Omaha our treasury had a balance of $4,188 in it.  Expenditures were made on the part of the board that they were not expecting to have been called upon to make and which reduced the balance on hand at the close of the first year to $1,089.93.  The weather during the time of holding the first and second fairs was unpropitious in the extreme and the people failed to respond as liberally during the second fair as they did during the first and it resulted in a debtor balance at the close of the second year of $1,667.45.  It is true that our reports as published to the world showed that we had a cash balance of $332.93, but you will remember that yourself and others took up and carried for the board $2,000 of warrants, which were still a claim against the association, leaving the real balance as I have stated.  The third year the fair was a most magnificent one, so far as the showing made is concerned.  The weather could not have been better under any circumstances, but the people failed to attend, the attendance being less than on either of the two years preceding.  We are confronted with a debtor balance of $4,314.74.  It is true to offset this balance we have bonds of the Omaha Fair and Speed association for $2,000, but so far <unclear/> able to learn these bonds have no <unclear/></p>

                            <head type="sub">DINSMORE'S DEMANDS.</head>
                            <p>This compels our board to face a very unpleasant state of affairs.  We are thoroughly convinced that a successful fair cannot be held upon the grounds now occupied.  It is an "open secret" the facilities for reaching the grounds are so inadequate that people from the city, as well as the <choice><sic>cauntry</sic><corr>country</corr></choice>, will not attempt the crush, annoyance and the unusual expenditure of time getting to and from the grounds.  Since the last fair I have been repeatedly told by people from over the state that they were in Omaha and would gladly have attended had the facilities for reaching the grounds have been such that they could have done it in fifteen or twenty minutes and without subjecting themselves to dangerous crushing while in transit.</p>
                            <p>We are fully aware that no street railway company would be justified in extending its tracks the distance necessarily required to have another line reach the grounds for the traffic that would be thereon during the fair, hence we are compelled to adopt the view that no further or better facilities for reaching the grounds will be had during the time remaining covered by our present contract to-wit: the years 1898 and 1899.  We are further confronted with the exposition to be held in 1898; to hold a fair that year would be a financial loss and one in '99 must suffer in its receipts from the effects of the exposition held the year previous.  With these facts staring us in the face I am compelled to submit for the consideration of yourself and your board of directors the following:</p>
                            <p>There must be an agreement in writing on the part of your board of directors to release the State Board of Agriculture from holding its fair on the present site during the year 1898; the Omaha Fair and Speed association, held by the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, at their par value, that the funds may be used to reduce the present deficit.  A failure to place in my hands a written release as to the fair for '98 without other conditions and a cash sale at par of the bonds before the 1st day of December of the present year will compel me as a chairman of the board to call the board of managers together and submit to them the question of declaring forfeited the contract now held with your people.  I dislike to be thus pointed in my correspondence, but duty compels it.  Awaiting your answer, I am, respectfully yours,</p>
                            <signed>J. B. DINSMORE.</signed>

                            <head type="sub">REGARD IT AS RIDICULOUS.</head>
                            <p>This letter was discussed by the members of the board of directors of the Fair and Speed association, who decided that inasmuch as the question of holding a state fair in Omaha in 1898 would more directly concern the new board of directors, which will be elected December 13, the matter should be turned over to them.  Mr. Dinsmore was so notified, and his reply was a curt statement that the board of managers would meet in Omaha on the date mentioned and suggested that if any of the directors of the Fair and Speed association wanted to be heard they would be accorded that privilege.</p>
                            <p>This being the situation, it is not regarded as probable that a split between the two organizations can be averted.  The members of the Fair and Speed association regard the proposition in regard to the bonds as too ridiculous to be considered.  The state board accepted to bonds of its own volition and without any guaranty that they would be redeemed at par or any other figure.  As far as a fair in 1898 is concerned, there is no difficulty, as the members of the local organization are perfectly willing to give the release asked for.  They will probably insist, however, that as an offset the board shall hold the state fair of 1900 in Omaha.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The bird's-eye view of the Transmississippi and International Exposition issued as a supplement with The Bee of this date shows the exposition as seen from an elevated point southeast of the grounds, the spectator looking directly towards the northwest.  The entire grounds occupied by the exposition are shown, the picture being technically correct in even the minor details almost without exception.  These details were taken from the plans and drawings in the offices of the various departments of the exposition and are not the result of the imagination of the artist who made the picture.  It gives a correct and comprehensive idea of the appearance the grounds will have when the gates open June 1, 1898, and the artistic merit of the drawing speaks for itself.</p>
                            <p>The exposition grounds are located in the northern part of the city, in the heart of one of the principal residence districts of Omaha.  The main entrance is two and one-eighth miles from the postoffice, and three double-track electric street railway lines now run direct to the several gates.  From a topographical standpoint the grounds are almost a perfect level, there being just sufficient variation in the levels to insure good drainage and pleasing landscape effects.  They are divided into three sections, each section being devoted to a distinctive purpose.  These sections have been designated as the Main court, the Bluff tract and the North tract.  In a general way the purpose to which each is devoted may be summarized as follows: In the Main court will be the main exhibit buildings; on the Bluff tract will be the state buildings and other exhibit buildings of secondary importance from an architectural standpoint, and on the North tract will be the irrigation, agriculture, transportation and other exhibit which require large amounts of space.</p>
                            <p>To return to the picture, the first thing that attracts the eye is the Main court.  This appears in the picture to the left of the middle foreground and is exactly one-half mile in length, the long axis running directly east and west.  On this portion of the ground is concentrated the main architectural effect, and the grouping of the buildings and the general ensemble of the whole court is the result of careful study on the part of the architects.  The central feature of this court is the lagoon, or canal, a basin of clear water 150 feet in width at the end nearest the spectator and broadening into a wide pool, known as the Mirror, at the farther end.  Arranged along the banks of this body of water and reflected from its crystal surface are over one mile of buildings.  The perspective is enhanced by the use of covered colonnades between the buildings, creating the effect of immense distance in looking down the lagoon, and, at the same time, affording a covered passageway entirely around the main court.</p>

                            <head type="sub">NEAREST OF THE BUILDINGS.</head>
                            <p>The large building on the Main court which is nearest the spectator is the Manufactures building.  Owing to the position of the spectator he is unable to see the very handsome main facade of this building, but he may judge of its beauty by looking at its twin directly opposite across the lagoon, the Machinery and Electricity building.  These buildings are the same size and both were designed by Chicago architects, the Manufactures by S. S. Beman and the Machinery and Electricity by Dwight H. Perkins.  They are much the same in exterior decoration, except that the central mass of the Machinery and Electricity is square in shape, while that of the Manufactures buildings is circular.  Both have colored colonnades extending along the front of the buildings.</p>
                            <p>The building between the spectator and the Manufactures building in the Main court, appearing rather small by comparison as it nestles snugly in the corner of the ground just inside the high fence which shuts out the gaze of the outside world, is the Auditorium.  In the corresponding corner of the Main court to the right, with flags and banners flying from every point, is the Girls' and Boys' building, where the little folks are to be amused and entertained while their elders inspect the other portions of the exposition and where the mothers and others interested in such matters may examine the latest improvements in the care of children, nursery furnishings, etc.</p>
                            <p>On the side of the lagoon nearest the spectator, just beyond the Manufactures building, is the Liberal Arts building and opposite it is the Mines and Mining building.  The former was designed by Fisher &amp; Lawrie of Omaha and the latter by John J. Humphreys of Denver.</p>
                            <p>Just beyond the Liberal Arts building is the main entrance to the exposition grounds.  This entrance is an arch of stone ninety feet in height, spanning the Twentieth street boulevard, 100 feet in width.  The distinguishing feature of the arch is the series of superimposed arches forming the frieze, each arch containing in its recess the coat of arms, in colors, of one of the transmississippi states.  These coats of arms give to the arch its name, the Arch of States.  Arranged at either side of this arch in semi-circular form are the ticket windows, where the hurrying crowd may be supplied with the credentials necessary to admit them to the grounds.</p>

                            <p>Directly opposite the Arch of States is the Administration arch, also spanning the Twentieth street boulevard and serving the double purpose of an entrance onto the plaza extending to the north tract as well as a building for the reception of distinguished guests.  Both of these arches were designed by Walker &amp; Kimball, architects-in-chief of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Beyond the Arch of States, on the south side of the lagoon, is the Art building, a beautiful structure designed by Eames &amp; Young of St. Louis.  This building is in two sections or wings, connected by an open court with colonnades extending along the front and rear of the court which give the exterior the appearance of being one building.</p>
                            <p>Opposite this building is the Agricultural building, which is the same size as the Mines building and designed along similar lines by Cass Gilbert of St. Paul, Minn.</p>
                            <p>Extending across the farther end of the Main court, facing the east, is the Government building, the huge structure which is being erected by the federal government for the housing of the exhibits showing the "functions and administrative faculties" of the several departments of the government.  The statue surrounding the dome of this building will be 175 feet from the ground and will be the highest point on the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>In the foregoing of the picture is the Bluff tract, so-called because it lies at the edge of a steep bluff overlooking the broad valley of the Missouri, commanding a view of the winding river for miles up or down.  This bluff disappears in the picture for the reason that the spectator is directly above it looking downward and the difference in elevation of the walks shown in the foreground and the railroad train seen approaching cannot be shown.  As a matter of fact the walks referred to are seventy-five feet above the level of the railroad track where the train appears.</p>

                            <head type="sub">AMONG THE STATE BUILDINGS.</head>
                            <p>The large building seen in the lower left-hand corner of the picture is the Horticulture building designed by Charles F. Beindorff of Omaha.  Just to the right of it, nearest the edge of the bluff, is the Nebraska building.  Back of this building, with the high peaked roof, is the Iowa building.  Since the drawing was made the Illinois Exposition commission has selected the site for the Illinois building, selecting a place just north of the Nebraska building, or a little to the right of the building as it appears in the picture.  The Wisconsin Exposition commission has also selected the site for its building, taking a spot directly back of the Illinois building and north of the Iowa building.</p>
                            <p>In the middle foreground are seen two lofty buildings exactly similar in appearance and each surmounted by a circular pavilion.  These are restaurants and are located at this point to give architectural finish to the east end of the wide viaduct which spans Sherman avenue and affords a means for visitors to pass from the Main court to the Bluff tract, or vice versa, without going outside the grounds.  The west end of this viaduct is spanned by a handsome pavilion which is almost hidden from view by one of the restaurants.  The circular colonnades seen at the east end of the lagoon constitute, with the pavilion just referred to, a handsome and unique feature of the east end of the Main court.</p>
                            <p>Visitors passing to the Bluff tract by means of this viaduct reach the broad plaza shown in front of the two large restaurants.  The small structure shown between this plaza and the edge of the bluff is a bandstand constructed according to the late scientific principles, with a sounding board at the back and top to throw the sound toward the spectators instead of allowing it to be dissipated in the upper air.  As first-class bands will be engaged to give daily concerts in this place the plaza promises to be a popular resort.</p>

                            <p>Extending from this bandstand to the right as far as the viaduct seen crossing Sherman avenue near the right side of the foreground, and running thence to a point almost exactly in the middle of the picture, is the Midway, or the amusement feature of the exposition.  Here will be assembled a collection of high class attractions such as have come to be regarded as a necessary adjunct to every wall regulated exposition.  The oriental appearing building to the right of the big restaurants is a Moorish house, forming the central feature of the Moorish village, which is enclosed by the wall extending for some distance to the right of the observer.  The concession next to the right is the Street of Cairo, extending to the viaduct.  Other concessions will be located on this tract between the two named and the edge of the bluff.</p>
                            <p>The building at the extreme right end of the Bluff tract, as it appears in the picture, is the Power building, where will be generated the power which will operate all the exhibits requiring to be kept in operation.  The motive power in the main exhibit buildings on the Main court will be electricity, being carried from the Power building to the exhibit buildings by heavy underground wires and delivered to motors furnished for each exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The viaduct spanning Sherman avenue near the Power building affords a means for reaching the North tract and the west portion of the Midway.  This viaduct is designed to convey the impression to the visitor that he is still within the grounds, and for that purpose there are arranged on either side small booths in which will be installed dealers in all sorts of wares, the whole having the appearance of an old country fair while it shuts off a view of the street over which the visitor is passing.</p>
                            <p>Upon leaving this viaduct the visitor will find himself in another section of the Midway, with attractions of various kinds grouped on each side.  At his right is the Sherman Umbrella, a mechanical novelty of striking appearance, and to his left is Shooting the Chutes.  On either side of the broad avenue, extending to a point almost in the middle of the picture, are arranged the concessions which are designed to amuse and instruct.  The Midway ends at the Twentieth street boulevard, which forms the connecting link between the Main court and the North tract, which occupies the upper and right hand portion of the picture.</p>

                            <p>The North tract is devoted <choice><sic>pricipally</sic><corr>principally</corr></choice> to the displays involving the practical application of one of the most important industries of the great Middle west, agriculture.  At the upper part of this portion of the picture, arranged in small squares, are the tracts devoted to showing various methods of irrigation, the cultivation of the sugar beet, and numerous other matters which it is desirable to show in actual operation.  The broad, low buildings seen scattered over the great extent of territory constituting the North tract are designed to house the exhibits of live stock, which will be one of the most interesting and extensive displays ever seen in this country.  Here also will be erected the immense buildings required to cover the exhibits of the Transportation department, including fully equipped trains of the most improved passenger and freight cars, locomotives and the hundreds of other things which are necessary adjuncts of every well equipped railroad.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the departments already referred to the North tract will give space for athletic sports of all kinds and suitable grounds will be prepared for bicycle races, all kinds of games and the multitude of other things which may be classed under the general head of sports.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Manager Kirkendall Promulgates a Series of Regulations.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds has posted a set of rules which will govern the exposition grounds in the future, and until the gates are ready to open for the exposition.  These rules will be enforced after about the middle of the coming week, that being the earliest at which the machinery involved by them can be put in operation.  The complete rules are as follows:</p>
                            <p>1. Trip passes will be furnished be all members of the executive committee, the president and secretary, to such persons as are entitled to them.</p>
                            <p>2. Contractors will be furnished with as many blank passes as may be required for their employes.</p>
                            <p>3. In issuing passes to employes, the employe will be required to sign same in autograph, and the contractor must sign the blank space left for his name.  The employe must present himself at the proper gate, where his name will be registered.  Upon leaving the grounds after the day's work, he will leave by the same gate he entered, when the pass will be countersigned.</p>
                            <p>4. Contractors must issue passes only to persons employed by them, and engaged on exposition work.</p>
                            <p>5. When an employe is discharged or quits the service, his pass must be taken up and promptly returned to department.  Would suggest to contractors that they hold back $1 from first wages paid to employe, to be refunded when pass is surrendered.</p>
                            <p>6. Contractors will be held responsible for all passes turned over to them, or for the misuse thereof.</p>
                            <p>7. Blank passes when issued to contractors will be charged to their accounts, and must be returned or otherwise accounted for when the work is finished.</p>
                            <p>8. When passes are issued to workmen, or people accepting them, they should be requested to carefully read the conditions printed on the back thereof.</p>
                            <p>9. The watchmen or guards must request strangers to keep out of the buildings, as they are liable to be injured by falling timbers or tools that may be dropped by the workmen overhead.</p>
                            <p>10. Persons desiring to make photographs of the grounds and buildings will be required to get a special permit for that purpose.</p>

                            <p>1. No smoking allowed within the grounds.</p>
                            <p>2. No open fires shall be built upon the grounds without written authority from the chief of the fire department.</p>
                            <p>3. Hard coal or coke only must be used in stoves, furnaces, and for hoisting engines.</p>
                            <p>4. All smokestacks and chimneys must be protected the wire spark-arresters.</p>
                            <p>5. Contractors must keep clear the roadways, and twelve feet of space around all hydrants, except by permission of the chief of the fire department.</p>
                            <p>Rule No. 10 will interest amateur photographers, of whom there are an unlimited number who have "shot" the grounds and buildings at short intervals ever since the work of construction was started.  Manager Kirkendall says that the only purpose of putting such a rule into effect at this time is to control the matter fully and enable the department to be in position to act in case a concession is granted to any person, giving them the exclusive privilege of taking pictures inside the grounds as was done at the World's fair.</p>

                            <p>A force of about twenty men were working with the tons of snow which had accumulated on the ice in the lagoon.  A team and a scraper were employed to drag the snow to the side of the canal and from here it was shoveled to the top of the bank.  The snow had drifted in the big basin until the ice was buried to a depth of several feet in some places, and the task of clearing the ice for skaters was no light one.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Senator Allen and Representative Mercer, who will introduce the bill correcting certain features of the Omaha exposition bill in their respective bodies Monday, have been provided with a memorandum as prepared by the committee of the government board on legislation.  The bill as prepared by this committee of the government board on legislation.  The bill as prepared by this committee provides for an exhibit by the Fish commission, and as there is no provision for the appointment of such representative, the bill authorizes the president to name a member of the board.  As a measure of economy and to permit of prompt action in case any other exposition is authorized by congress, to follow closely on the heels of the Omaha fair, provision is made authorizing the president to order exhibits sent after the close of the Omaha exposition to such other exposition direct without having first to return them to Washington.  The bill is also amended so as to permit of the purchase of an exhibits to complete those which would otherwise show gaps and to purchase articles and materials necessary in preparation of the exhibits.  As the original act does not make provision for the employment of suitable persons as officers, agents, etc., as assistants to the board, this feature is remedied in the new bill amendatory to the old.  Certain changes are made as to the transportation, as it may be necessary to ship exhibits from points other than Washington, a number of exhibits having doubtless been stored in Nashville.  Changes are also made so as to provide for actual expenses of the board for travel and per diem allowance in lieu of reimbursement for actual expenses for subsistence.</p>
                            <p>Heretofore officers of the army and navy have been allowed amounts allowed to officers of those departments while traveling under orders but as provided by the amended bill all members of the board will be placed on the same footing.  The bill further provides for details being made from departments <unclear/> the government of responsible persons <unclear/> care for and return exhibits, their salaries <unclear/>o be paid as in case of any detail.  There <unclear/>s no charge made in the amount of th<unclear/> appropriation.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Among the largest and most pretentious of the amusement features of the Midway of the Transmississippi Exposition will be the Moorish village.  This concession will be the very gate to the exposition's amusement quarter.  Just to the left of the main viaduct and close to Sherman avenue will be clustered its picturesque group of domes, minarets, pinnacles and vari-colored awnings and streamers.  The first of its buildings is a low structure with two dome-capped towers in staff, gilded and made to resemble repousse gold.  Towering above this building and forming the further side of an open court will be the palace, the main feature of the group, in the form of a mosque with large central dome and corner spires.  The intervening court, with its frivolous little open-air theater, will be a veritable tropical garden, masked from the public street by a double colonnade of Moorish arches, roofed with tile.  In the palace itself, travelers and students of architecture will recognize much of the beautiful and well known detail from the Alhambra and other familiar monuments of Granada, with bits from Cordova and other Moorish Meccas.  Next beyond this will be a Moorish house, correct in all its details, both interior and exterior.  Then come groups of shops, gay with eastern rugs and metal trinkets.  These shops will be arranged in short recessed streets or cul-de-sacs, where the visitor may easily give full swing to his imagination, for everything American will be shut from his view and to his ears will come the call of the muezzin wafted from the Streets of Cairo beyond.  Two other large buildings and more shops will complete this interesting ensemble.</p>
                            <p>The attractions of the Moorish Village, aside from its exterior, will be many and varied.  In the first building several optical illusions will be shown, a capable illusionist having been sent abroad by the managers of the concession to select and secure the latest and best features in this line.  In the palace will be displayed an interesting series of tableaux and figures in wax, illustrating history, art, science, the drama, poetry and fiction, together with a "chamber of horrors" and a "devil's cave."  Beyond the palace oriental merchants will offer the best products of their countries, and in some of the products of their countries, and in some of the shops will be seen artisans engaged in manufacturing the articles with which they hope to secure the odd dimes of the curious.</p>
                            <p>In the last building will be installed the "Moorish Mystic Maze," a confusing, intricate and elaborate arrangement of mirrors, where the bewildered visitor may see himself in all places, on all sides, and in all directions; where, walking in any direction he pleases he will see crowds of himself approaching, scores of himself walking with him.  It is promised that many entirely novel features will be introduced in the Maze.</p>

                            <p>One of the concessions on the Midway of the Transmississippi Exposition will be an Indian village, which will be inhabited by representatives of four tribes of Pueblo Indians.  This concession has been awarded to J. E. Saint of Albuquerque, N. M., who promises an entertainment of the most unique and unusual nature.</p>
                            <p>The Pueblo Indians are among the semi-civilized of the North American tribes.  Many of their rites and ceremonies are performed in the same manner and for the same purposes that governed their performance before the white man set foot on this continent.  Among the tribes which Mr. Saint says he will have in his villages are the Moquis, one of the mildest and least offensive of all.  Some of the ceremonies of this tribe are bloodcurdling in the extreme to the uninitiated and none more so than the far-famed snake dance.  This is one of the most sacred religious rites of the Moquis Indians and is performed with the greatest pomp and ceremony.  It is a solemn celebration, intended to propitiate the god of rain and induce him to send refreshing showers on the parched plains.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Saint assures the exposition authorities that he has made arrangements by which this dance will be presented at the exposition.  He says he has secured a number of members of the tribe who will go through the performance in all its details.</p>

                            <head type="sub">L. Bradford Prince Elected President at Its Meeting.</head>
                            <p>Hon. L. Bradford Prince of New Mexico writes to the Department of Publicity that the commission from that territory has organized, and last week held a two days' session at Santa Fe.  Organization was effected by electing L. Bradford Prince president, T. J. Curran secretary and S. H. Day treasurer.  The matter of making an exhibit was thoroughly discussed, and it was decided that at least 4,000 square feet would be needed.  On this topic the following resolution was adopted:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That this commission is desirous of making an exhibit at Omaha, as complete and satisfactory as the small means at command will permit, and will use every exertion to that end; that an imperfect and incomplete exhibit will be satisfactory neither to the exposition authorities, nor to the people of New Mexico, and in fact will be injurious to the <choice><sic>territiry</sic><corr>territory</corr></choice> instead of beneficial; that in consideration of the small sum at our disposal, it is necessary to concentrate the territorial exhibit and confine it to the following departments: Mineral, agricultural, including the sugar beet, wool and canaigre industries, horticultural, historical and educational; that the smallest possible amount of space required for these exhibits is as follows: Mineral, 2,000 square feet; agricultural, 1,000 square feet; horticultural, 500 square feet; historical and educational, 500 square feet.  An exhibit of double this space will be far more satisfactory to all concerned than one thus cramped and circumscribed, and we earnestly request the exposition authorities to furnish double the areas above specified and pledge ourselves to have it satisfactorily occupied.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That it is impossible for this commission to pay anything whatever for space at the exposition, the small sum at our disposal being insufficient to pay the expenses of collecting, transporting and taking charge of the exhibit during the exposition; and if the exposition authorities cannot furnish the minimum space above mentioned free of charge, we will be compelled most reluctantly to abandon the attempt to make an exhibit, feeling assured that an imperfect and incomplete exhibition of the products and resources of the territory will be both unsatisfactory and injurious.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Narrow Escape from a Serious Accident&#8212;Raising Heavy Trusses.</head>
                            <p>There came near being a serious accident at the exposition grounds this morning.  The upright stringer of one of the pile-driving machines at the west end slipped and fell.  A dozen workmen were just below it and would undoubtedly have been caught but for the fact that the stringer hesitated an instant in its fall and gave them a chance to run for their lives.</p>
                            <p>In the Electricity building this afternoon the heavy central truss for the roof was raised with the aid of a windlass, a dozen workmen and a pair of strong horses.  On this building there appeared to be more workmen employed today than usual and one could most see its growth.</p>
                            <p>The clear weather and the warm sunshine gave a good opportunity for increased work on all the exposition buildings today and the contractors were not slow to take advantage of the favorable conditions.  A number of workmen toiled on some of the buildings all day yesterday, but their jobs were rather chilling, especially for those at work on the roofs.  The warmer weather today greatly facilitated work in all departments.</p>
                            <p>There were not many visitors to the exposition grounds today.  The melting snow and ice made all the roadways extremely muddy and journeying about the grounds was rendered most unpleasant.  The large attendance on Sunday, according to the gate-keepers, was more than sufficient to last over several days this week and still keep up a good average daily attendance.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska building is pushing right up toward the clouds, and the progress being made in its construction is watched with more satisfaction, perhaps, than that of any other building on the grounds.  Today workmen finished up the frame work of the four corner domes and adorned them with neat flag poles.  Work on the big central dome is going ahead rapidly and to a man on the grounds it now looks as though Nebraska were on top.</p>

                            <head type="sub">KANSAS CITY INTENDS TO HAVE A BUILDING</head>
                            <head type="sub">Commercial Club Takes Up the Project While St. Louis Manufacturers' Association Names Its Committee on Ways and Means.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Kansas City people seem sincere in their desire for an independent building at the Transmississippi Exposition, although the project has not yet taken on definite shape.  The fact that the Commercial club of Kansas City has the subject in hand is a guarantee that the enterprise will not be allowed to lag, and it is safe to say even now that the $20,000 the club expects to spend in providing headquarters for Kansas Cityans in Omaha next summer will be forthcoming.  It appears the venture is not sprung on the spur of the moment, but Secretary Clendenning has had it in mind for some time and has taken counsel with the leading business men of the club on the matter.  He divulged it to the Omaha visitors Sunday only after he felt reasonably certain that in its announcement he was raising no hopes which should be left unfulfilled.  A dispatch to The Bee from Kansas City last night says:</p>
                            <p>A movement to have a Kansas City building at the Transmississippi Exposition has been started.  The matter will be brought before the Commercial club in the form of a resolution by Secretary Clendenning at the meeting tomorrow night.  It is proposed that Kansas City shall erect a handsome building on the exposition grounds in which there will be a bureau of information and reception rooms for visitors.  Kansas City merchants and manufacturers will probably not make exhibits in the building, but will be represented there by their agents, if the plan is adopted.</p>
                            <p>Chairman W. H. Green of the Nebraska delegation, which passed through the city yesterday to attend the deep water convention at Houston, Tex., said that if Kansas City wanted to have a building at the exposition it would be given a good location.  It would require from $15,000 to $25,000 to erect and furnish a suitable structure.</p>

                            <p>Commissioner Richardson writes from St. Louis, giving most encouraging reports of the progress he is making among the merchants of that city.  There is the deepest interest felt in the project there, and the exhibit from the merchants and manufacturers of the Mound city is already certain to become one of the most notable of the whole exception.  Concerning the work being done the St. Louis Globe Democrat says: "President L. D. Kingsland of the St. Louis Manufacturers' association has appointed the following committee on ways and means to take charge of the St. Louis exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition: C. H. Sampson, chairman; Charles D. McClure, J. A. J. Schultz, M. C. Wetmore, John P. Camp, Harrison I. Drummond, W. H. Moore, D. R. Francis, Ben Altheiser, H. R. Todd, L. M. Rumsey, Charles Mansur, E. S.

                            <head type="sub">CASPER IS COMING ALSO.</head>
                            <p>CASPER, Wyo., does not intend to linger any distance behind the fair procession.  The great wool market in what used to be the wild and woolly haunt of Lin McLean and his cowboy companions, who fought and danced and loved and got married and settled down and went to ranching, is coming to the exposition with several kinds of an exhibit.  On this topic a recent issue of the Cheyenne Tribute says:</p>
                            <p>Since Colonel Coutant ,Judge Bramel and others have taken the initiative in working up public sentiment on the proposition of Wyoming making a state exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition, Editor Korns of the Casper Derrick is in Cheyenne and expressed himself to a Tribune reporter on the matter, saying Casper wanted to join in pushing the project along and Natrona county wanted space in the display.</p>
                            <p>State Engineer Elwood Mead showed Mr. Korns the cases used by the state in making the World's Fair exhibit that are now stored in the capitol basement and used in exhibiting the oil, soda and grains in the capitol corridors, and both gentlemen were of the opinion that there were enough to make a most creditable showing of the state's products ,since it was learned that fully half the furniture was stored in the university building at Larimie.  These essential requirements being had, the greatest cost of a display is covered.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Korns was enthusiastic in the state doing itself proud in this matter and said that Natrona county would make an exhibit alone of her oils, axle grease, asbestos, copper, wools and agricultural products that would bring fame to the state.  he said that within thirty days the little town, with a longing eye to the state capitol building, had made two rich gold strikes right at its door, opened a coal mine that is shipping its output to the east and bids fair to rival the Glenrock coal camp, formed two local companies that are driving tunnels into Casper mountain copper and asbestos properties and have pledged an electric light plant and a telephone system.</p>
                            <p>Crowded with these successes, Casper, which wants a great deal and generally takes about all she wants, is infatuated with her ability to make a Transmississippi exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Casper, as a flockmen's headquarters, he says, bids fair to rival Cheyenne as a cattle king's city during out palmiest days and the shipments of wool that now amount to from three to four million pounds annually promises to surpass that creditable showing next year, while the shipments of stock are simply amazing.  With the amount of wool increasing, the price doubled and Pat Sullivan mayor, it is no wonder Casper is taking on such haughty metropolitan airs.</p>

                            <p>Montana fruitgrowers are arranging for their horticultural display.  The Rocky Mountain Husbandman, published at White Sulphur Springs, says:</p>
                            <p>We notice some of the early fruitgrowers of the state are raising a greater variety of standard fruit than many of those farmers who have more recently started orchards.  Hon. W. B. Harlan of Como, Ravalli county, exhibited about fifty varieties at the Hamilton and Missoula fairs last fall and more than twenty of them were kinds that are not generally grown in this state.  They are Russian varieties and a number of them are good winter apples.  Quite a number of these peculiarly named apples have been preserved by the state for the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>

There will also be held a meeting of the congress committee of the Woman's board at headquarters Wednesday morning at 10 o'clock.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition yesterday afternoon let a contract for decorating the Administration building with a large number of fancy shields to Leopold Bennett.  The contract price is $325.</p>

They were entertained at breakfast at Hotel Worth and escorted to the court house, where a large crowd of citizens had gathered.  The mayor said the people of Ft. Worth were alive to the benefits of the exposition and ready to act.  A reply by General Colby enthused the people and prompt action was promised.  At Waco a large crowd was at the depot and a speech was made by L. L. H. Austin of Lincoln.  Editor Davis of the Waco Times-Herald replied, saying the people of Waco stood ready to do anything to benefit the transmississippi states.  He said he was authorized to pledge the assistance of city officers and the Commercial club to the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Delay Occasioned by the Storm Induces Greater Activity Among the Contractors Who Eagerly Push Operations.</head>
                            <p>Swarms of workmen are again clinging to the walls and roofs of the big buildings on the exposition grounds and are endeavoring to make up for the delay produced by the storm of the latter part of last week.  The good and warmer weather has permitted appreciable progress to be made upon all the structures.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska building has reached its topmost point.  The highest dome on the structure has been almost completed and this morning the flagstaff upon it was raised in the air.  The building is now almost completely roofed over.  The squad of workmen on the Bluff tract, upon which Nebraska's building is located, has resumed operations on the water works system and is continuing to set out the trees with which the area will be adorned.</p>
                            <p>In a short time another of the buildings will have put on its coat of white.  This morning Contractors Smith and Eastman set their workmen at the task of putting staff upon the Machinery and Electricity building.  The warm weather has also permitted Contractor Bonet to almost complete the white coat on the Administration arch.  The workmen are putting on the finishing touches today.</p>
                            <p>Hard luck is still standing in the way of the building of the Fine Arts Palace.  Work on this structure has been delayed by the non-arrival of lumber.  This morning, however, five carloads of lumber came in and it was expected that the structure could be started.  When the material was examined, however, it was found to consist of roof lumber.  The delay is disappointing, but the contractor made the best out of the situation by setting his workmen to work getting the roof timbers in proper form.</p>
                            <p>The Government building has <choice><sic>comenced</sic><corr>commenced</corr></choice> to rise into existence.  The piling has been put in and this morning the first of the big timbers to support the outside walls were erected.  Appreciable progress is also evident on the Auditorium.  The first floor of the building is in such condition that work on the second story framework is being begun.</p>
                            <p>The roof on the Mining building is about finished and the carpenters have commenced work on the tower at the northwest corner.  Staffs for this superstructure have been put in place.  The work of trussing on the Agricultural building has also been completed.  The Liberal Arts building is also advancing in good <choice><sic>sape</sic><corr>shape</corr></choice>.</p>

                            <p>It is not at all improbable that the volcano Kilauea, which formed a most conspicuous and attractive feature of the World's Fair Midway plaisance, will be reproduced along grander lines at the Transmississippi and International Exposition.  Correspondence with this end in view is now in progress.</p>
                            <p>Lorin Thurston, formerly minister of the United States to the Hawaiian Islands,  and W. F. Sesser of St. Joseph, Mich., are the men who are interested in the movement to establish the volcano at the exposition.  The high standing both enjoy leads to the belief that their promises to put on a show that will be worth going miles to see will be faithfully carried out.  Those who attended the World's Fair remember quite well the vivid portrayal of a Hawaiian volcano given there and the mere announcement that that exhibition would be bettered here would undoubtedly draw great crowds.  If the pending contracts for this exhibition are successfully concluded the representation of a volcano of the Pacific islands Mr. McKinley wants to annex will be ensconced in a circular building on the Midway of the exposition, 130 feet in diameter and fifty feet in height.</p>

                            <head type="sub">TRANSPORTATION LINES AND EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Goods for Purposes of Exhibition Will Be Hauled One Way Free of Charge by All Roads.</head>
                            <p>Gradually the railroads of all sections of the United States are acknowledging the Transmississippi and International Exposition and granting rates favorable to it.  Passenger rates have not yet been agreed upon, but it is the opinion of the general passenger agents of this city that all railroads will grant a one-fare rate for the round trip to Omaha from June 1 to November next year.</p>
                            <p>Freight rates on most lines have already been declared.  These rates for the transportation of goods to be exhibited at the exposition are uniformly the same rates that were granted to the World's fair at Chicago.  They have been agreed upon by the railroads in various parts of the country, and announced after meetings of lines composing various traffic associations.  All lines in this section of the country agreed to the one-fare rate some time ago, as was announced through the medium of the Transmissouri Freight Rate committee.  The latest association to fall in line is the Southeastern Freight association, comprising the most important lines east of the Mississippi river and south of the Ohio.  At the sixth session of the executive board of this association, held at Atlanta, Ga., on November 30, S. F. Parrott, presiding, the following resolution was adopted:</p>
                            <p>On property to be exhibited at the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held at Omaha, Neb., from June 1 to November 1, 1898, full tariff rates will be charged from point of origin to Omaha, and same may be returned from Omaha to original point of shipment via same route free, provided a certificate of the proper officials of the Transmississippi and International Exposition is presented and surrendered at the time shipments are offered for return, showing that same have not changed ownership; and provided further that the original expense bill indicating billing under which the shipments moved to Omaha are also surrendered at the time bill of lading for return shipments are executed.  Terminal charge in Omaha to be in addition to the above.</p>
                            <p>W. N. Babcock, manager of the Department of Transportation of the exposition, this morning received the following telegram from James Mosher, general eastern freight agent of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio railroad.  "Your letter of December 3 will pass your goods through the custom house free."  F. W. Fourkee, foreign freight agent of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading railroad, showed similar <choice><sic>enterpriseby</sic><corr>enterprise by</corr></choice> the following message: "If exhibits are consigned in my care will make entry without charge."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Danger of Accident Emphasized by Painful Experience.</head>
                            <p>Visitors to the buildings on the Exposition grounds are running considerable risk in wandering carelessly through the structures upon which work is being done on the upper stories or the roof.  Yesterday a stranger was walking under one of the galleries in the Liberal Arts building when a heavy piece of timber was accidentally dropped down.  The beam missed his head by only a few inches.  If he had been struck he would have been instantly killed.  The warning has been sufficient and in the future no one who has no business there will be allowed to go through the structure until it is completed.  In this building also one of the workmen, Andrew Wymen, yesterday sustained a painful but not not serious injury.  In lifting a heavy piece of timber he let it drop upon his thumb.  The member was crushed, but it is believed that amputation is not necessary.  The wound was sufficient to incapacitate the man from work.</p>
                            <p>The Liberal Arts building, although it was begun late, promises to be sooner completed than other buildings which were begun earlier.  The roof trusses have all been completed and the workmen who have been employed on them will probably be discharged this afternoon.  The first of the pieces will be hoisted late this afternoon or tomorrow.  As soon as several are in place the work of putting on the roofing will be begun.</p>
                            <p>The Manufactures building is likely to be completed in a short time now.  Almost all the staff is on, even to the ornamentations.  The translucent skylight is almost finished.  This afternoon the lathers will complete their work on the interior and tomorrow the plastering will be finished.  Next to this structure the Administration arch is nearest completion.  There is still some outside staff to be put on this building, but the workmen are placing the ornamental pieces in the interior.</p>
                            <p>The Mines and Mining building is also about ready for its white coat, both inside and outside.  The lathing was begun this morning, and following on the heels of this the staff is being put in place.  On the inside enough lathing has been put on to allow the plasterers to get to work.  The roof on this structure is about completed, the final work being done on the skylight.</p>
                            <p>A number of roof girders have been put in place on the Machinery building and the roofing is being commenced.  The same is the case in the Agricultural building.  On the former also the staff contractors have commenced to put in place the staff.</p>
                            <p>The walls of the Government building will soon be commenced.  The piling is about completed, and the wall girders are being erected.  All the timber for this structure, some fifteen carloads, has arrived in the city and eight of them are being unloaded on the grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">President Diaz Promises Creditable Representation at Omaha.</head>
                            <p>All indications point toward the most extensive and the most superior exhibit of Mexican products at the Transmississippi and International exposition that the neighbor republic has ever made in the United States.  This is the tone of a letter received at exposition headquarters from J. D. Powell, who is looking after the interests of the exposition in Mexico.</p>
                            <p>In his letter he says that he is meeting with great success in obtaining exhibits, that he has just seen President Diaz, who assures him that each state in the Republic of Mexico would be creditably represented at the exposition.  Mr. Powell's brother, Dr. W. D. Powell, has recently been appointed chairman of the Mexican commission for the exposition and reports that the commission is actively at work securing exhibits for what promises to be the finest Mexican display ever made in the United States.</p>
                            <p>Mr. J. D. Powell asks that 20,000 square feet of space in the Manufactures building be reserved for Mexico, as the Mexican manufacturers will need an apartment 100x200 feet, at least.  The Mexican government is reported to be especially desirous of making a great showing in this department.</p>
                            <p>A movement is on foot to transfer to the Transmississippi Exposition the large and valuable Mexican display now on exhibition in the museum of the Philadelphia Bourse.  Mr. Powell suggests that this exhibit might be secured for Omaha permanently, after the close of the exposition here, as the majority of Mexican manufacturers, merchants and government officials feel that their interests are more closely allied with the transmississippi section of the United States than with the portion of the country along the Atlantic seaboard.</p>
                            <p>An interesting feature of Mexico's part in the Transmississippi Exposition will be the presence of a numerous Mexican brass band.  Mr. Powell writes that this band has ordered new uniforms, new instruments and is rehearsing new music for the trip to Omaha next year.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Superintendent Pearse Has the Circular Letter Ready.</head>
                            <p>Within the next day or two Superintendent Pearse of the public schools will send out several hundred circular letters to the principal educators of the transmississippi states presenting the idea of holding an educational congress in connection with the exposition and asking their co-operation in the enterprise.  The circular is issued by the executive committee that was appointed some days ago and briefly outlines the plan so far as it has been formulated.</p>
                            <p>It contends that this seems to be a great opportunity for the tens of thousands of teachers who line in the states west of the Mississippi and wish to attend the exposition.  Many of them are unable to attend the meetings of the National Educational association and the proposed plan would give them the same benefits that they would enjoy by that attendance, together with the opportunity to see the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The general plan of the program is briefly outlined.  It will be somewhat similar to those followed by the National Educational association and the general meetings will be addressed by the best educational speakers.  Section meetings are included for the purpose of pursuing particular lines of educational work and these will be addressed by experts in that particular line of work.</p>
                            <p>It is suggested that the congress is not in any way antagonistic to the National Educational association, and some information is afforded in regard to the entertainment of the visitors and the very low railroad rates that will be secured.  A paragraph is also devoted to the general scope of the exposition and it is suggested that the latter part of June would probably be a satisfactory date for the congress.  Those addressed are requested to transmit their views on the subject to the committee, which consists of George E. MacLean, chancellor University of Nebraska; Joseph E. Hisey, superintendent of schools, Council Bluffs; Anna Foos, member of Woman's Board, Transmississippi and International Exposition; J. E. Utt, secretary Commercial club, Omaha; Carroll G. Pearse, superintendent of schools, Omaha; W. R. Jackson, superintendent public instruction, Nebraska; A. A. Munroe, superintendent of schools, South Omaha; J. M. Gillan, secretary Board of Education, Omaha; Victor Rosewater, managing editor, Omaha Bee.</p>

                            <p>Another of the state commissions for the Transmississippi Exposition, that of Florida, is ready for active work in the interests of the big show.

                            <p>The Aerostatic Power company of Baltimore has made application for space in which to exhibit its engines.</p>
                            <p>N. A. Erb of Washington, D. C., wants space to display a fine line of hand painted chinaware and decorated glassware.</p>
                            <p>The firm of Dewal &amp; Raynolds of Chicago this morning made application for space sixteen by sixteen feet to exhibit a line of paints, varnishes and artists' materials.</p>
                            <p>The outside cover of the current issue of Campbell's Soil Culture is adorned with good representations of the Government and the Agriculture buildings at the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>
                            <p>"The camels are coming, hoo-rah, hoo-rah."  This was the glad acclaim that rang through the exposition headquarters this morning when the first picture of the Moorish village of the exposition was unveiled.  The picture represents the Moorish village in all its attractiveness, more attractive even than its predecessor at the World's fair, and the camels are in the front rank.</p>
                            <p>Reports from Commissioner Richardson at St. Louis received this morning indicate that every branch of trade there has its organization for the exposition now perfected, and that a delegation of prominent business men of St. Louis will soon visit Omaha for the purpose of looking over the grounds.  As the Nashville exposition obtained neither aid nor recognition from St. Louis or Missouri, this is considered quite an achievement.  Mr. Richardson writes that the governor will soon announce the personnel of the Missouri commission for the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The exposition has had the effect of considerably increasing the amount of mail matter handled through the Omaha postoffice.  During the last year the exposition's bill for postage has amounted to about $6,000.  The mail received here has also been largely increased, though not to such an extent as has the outgoing mail.  It is said on good authority that the postoffice receipts for the last year would not have shown any increase over those of one year ago had it not been for the large amount of exposition mail sent out during the twelve months past.</p>

                            <p>Just before the council adjourned a communication was received from President Wattles of the Exposition association urging the council to confer with the officials of the Omaha Water company and endeavor to make some arrangement by which water could be furnished at once at the exposition grounds.  Mr. Wattles accompanied his communication and briefly stated the proposition from an exposition standpoint.  He stated that there were only to ways in which water can be supplied.  One was by the construction of a special plant and the other was through the water company.  The former would cost at least $75,000, which the exposition association could not afford.  The water company had proposed to furnish the water free if some arrangement could be made that would warrant the improvements in its plant that would be necessary in order to furnish the additional service required.</p>
                            <p>The matter was debated at some length.  Stuht contended that the council could take no action until the injunction was dissolved and that in any case be was not in favor of prejudicing any of the rights of the citizens in the controversy with the water company.</p>
                            <p>Mercer opined that under the decision of the courts there was no controversy and all that was left for the city to do was to pay the bills.</p>
                            <p>Bingham went back into recent history in reply to Stuht and suggested that if the council had compromised with the water company when it had opportunity the tax payers would be about $400,000 ahead.</p>
                            <p>In reply to some further questioning Mr. Wattles suggested that what the water company wanted in return for free water for the exposition was an extension of its contract to the date when its franchise expired in 1908.  He said that he had no desire to ask the council to do anything that was not in the interest of the taxpayers, but it was a matter of vital importance to the exposi-</p>

                            <p>This opened the gates to a general discussion of the same ideas that have figured in previous council proceedings and the old straw that had remained undisturbed since early in the year was raked up and thrashed over again with considerable vigor.

                            <p>LINCOLN, Neb., Dec. 7.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;The state superintendent of public instruction will in a few days issue a circular <choice><sic>leter</sic><corr>letter</corr></choice> relating to the Transmississippi Educational exhibit, of which the following will be the text:</p>
                            <p>To All Nebraska Educators: Having been appointed by the members of the Nebraska commissioners Transmississippi and International Exposition as superintendent of the state educational division, which appointment carries with it the supervision of the general educational exhibits for this state, and which is in perfect harmony with the plans of the Woman's Board of Managers for the transmississippi territory, this circular is sent out with the hope that it may meet with hearty response on the part of school people.  I earnestly solicit the hearty co-operation of school officers and of all others who are interested in the educational affairs of our state.</p>
                            <p>The Transmississippi and International Exposition which will be held at Omaha from June 1 to November 1, 1898, will doubtless be one of the greatest expositions held on the American continent, and second only to the great World's Fair held at Chicago in 1893.  We may well be proud of our resources, our schools and our educational system, and feel gratified that Nebraska has the lowest percentage of illiteracy of any state in the union.  It behooves the educators of our great and <choice><sic>belowed</sic><corr>beloved</corr></choice> state to see that Nebraska has an educational exhibit that will be in keeping with this record.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska state commission, at an expense of several thousand dollars, has liberally provided 10,200 square feet of floor space, together with contiguous wall space, which will be absolutely free to all schools of our state supported by taxation, making application at this office before February 1, 1898.  On this date the space will be apportioned among those whose applications are on file and each applicant notified of the amount of space to which his school is entitled.  In graded schools the principal or city superintendent should make application for all the schools under his charge.  The number of applications received, together with the teaching force so represented, will probably form the basis of the apportionment of space.</p>
                            <p>The county superintendent of schools in each county is county manager.  All exhibits of the county must be shipped by him in one shipment in order that special arrangements may be made for their free transportation to Omaha.  The exhibit must reach Omaha between the 1st and 20th of April, 1898.  School officers and patrons are urgently requested to co-operate with teachers, and in every possible way assist in making the exhibit of such a character as will prove a benefit to the school and a credit to the county and state.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the diploma of the exposition to each bona fide exhibitor, the Bureau of Education offers as another incentive pennants, as follows: One special pennant for the best state exhibit; ten pennants for ten of the best county exhibits; one pennant for best exhibit in each of thirty-two other classes.</p>
                            <p>Rule 33 of the general rules and regulations for the government of the Transmississippi and International Exposition is as follows: "To each bona fide exhibitor or his representative, one pass to the exposition grounds will be issued free of charge and the necessary workmen's passes will be supplied.  Special rules will regulate the terms and conditions of admission."</p>
                            <p>Circulars giving more extended information will be sent upon application.  The main object of this circular is to ascertain what schools will exhibit, in order that space may be properly apportioned.</p>
                            <p>Country schools, graded schools, in fact all schools and grades from the kindergarten up through the State university, may exhibit in the exposition in their respective departments free from all expense after the exhibit is ready for shipment and in the hands of the county superintendent.  Very respectfully,</p>

                            <p>HOUSTON, Tex., Dec. 7.&#8212;(Special Telegram)&#8212;Texas is right in line for the Transmississippi Exposition, and a commission will be organized at once to see that the state is properly represented by exhibits.  The representatives of all sections of the state in Houston today are thoroughly aroused to the situation, and it has been announced with authority that Texas will not be behind the other transmississippi states.  The mission of the Nebraska delegation is accomplished.</p>
                            <p>The convention the Nebraska delegation came here to attend was composed of delegates from all sections of Texas and from Nebraska.  It was addressed by Governor Culberson, Lieutenant Governor Jester, John H. Reagan of Palestine, chairman of the Texas Railway commission; Mayor H. B. Rice of Houston, Judge N. G. Kittrell, ex-Governor Saunders, General Colby and others.  Frank Holland, ex-mayor of Dallas, was made chairman, and L. L. H. Austin of Lincoln, Neb., was elected secretary.  The exposition overtopped all other issues and the Texas speakers expressed the greatest enthusiasm for the enterprise.  Deep water was discussed, but formed only an incident.</p>
                            <p>A committee on resolutions was appointed with ex-Governor Saunders as chairman and Governor Culberson, General Colby and eight others as members.  This committee reported a long series of resolutions, the preamble reciting the facts concerning the origin of the exposition; the steps that have been taken by citizens of Nebraska to put the enterprise on its feet; the preparations being made by states in and out of the transmississippi region and by foreign governments to take part; and declaring that Texas was losing a golden opportunity by not taking steps to be represented.</p>
                            <p>The resolutions provided for the immediate organization of a Texas exposition commission to take such immediate action as may be necessary to make an exhibit commensurate with the resources and future possibilities of the largest state in the union.  The resolutions further requested the governor of Texas to appoint a vice president for the state, and the latter was authorized to appoint a vice president for each senatorial district in the state.  These persons and the vice president to constitute the commission.</p>
                            <p>These resolutions were adopted unanimously in the midst of enthusiasm and applause.</p>
                            <p>The meeting was entertained by the Glee club of the Nebraska delegation with typical songs set to popular airs.  One sung to the air of "Dixie" took the convention by storm.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska delegation took a prominent part in a large public meeting tonight and aroused more enthusiasm regarding the exposition.  The party will be in Sabine Pass and Port Arthur tomorrow.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Lord Linton Will Loan the Exposition His Stuart Collection.</head>
                            <p>Lord Linton of England, who owns a considerable bit of real estate in Omaha, has informed the exposition authorities that he is informed the exposition authorities that he is greatly interested in the success of the exposition, and will do all in his power to aid it.  He has just instructed his agent in this country, Mr. Wiseman of New York, to make arrangements for loaning his valuable art collection, now in New York, to the Art department of the exposition.  This collection is known as the Stuart collection, and includes more than fifty works by the old masters, ranging in value from $5,000 to $100,000.</p>
                            <p>In the Stuart collection there is a statue of Venus by Chidus, valued at $100,000; a painting of the Duchess of Devonshire, by Gainsborough, 1779, valued at $30,000; the Duchess of Bedford, by Van Dyke, 1638, valued at $50,000; a Garden Scene, by Watteau, 1717, valued at $25,000; one of Rembrant's paintings of 1656, valued at $20,000; another of Reubens, 1598, valued at $10,000, and forty-two others almost as well known to art students.  The announcement that the full Stuart collection will be exhibited at the Transmississippi Exposition is regarded as the best news that has come to the Art department yet.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Chance for Omaha to Secure the Body's 1898 Session.</head>
                            <p>There is an opportunity for Omaha to secure another meeting of national character and considerable attendance for 1898.  It is the Presbyterian general assembly, and the matter was taken up this morning for the first time.</p>
                            <p>Information that this assembly can be secured for Omaha with some energetic work came in the form of a letter from Harry E. Heller, district passenger agent of the Burlington route, located at Allentown, Pa.  In a letter to the officials of the company here he states that he has just interviewed Dr. Roberts, one of the lenders of the assembly.  The latter is of the opinion that any western city making a good offer can secure the Presbyterian general assembly for 1898.  The Burlington officials in this city say that they will make every effort to land the convention here.  The co-operation of the exposition authorities, of the leading lights in the Presbyterian church and of the Commercial club will be at once sought with this end in view.</p>

                            <p>The Union Pacific took another fall out of Father Time this morning.  The Oregon Short Line was eight hours late in handing over its Portland connection to the Union Pacific, and in order to catch the first section of train No. 2 it was necessary to do some fast running.  The run from Cheyenne to North Platte, 225 miles was made in 218 minutes full time.  This included a stop of three minutes at Sidney to change locomotives.  The actual running time was 215 minutes, giving an average of something over sixty-three miles an hour.  From Cheyenne to Sidney the train was pulled by Engineer Post in charge of locomotive No. 1809.  Engineer Stuart, with locomotive No. 811, pulled the train from Sidney to North Platte, arriving at the latter point at 8:35 o'clock this morning.  At North Platter the extra train was but forty-five minutes behind the regular train, and overtook it at Grand Island, running from North Platte to Grand Island at about sixty miles an hour.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Progress on the Big Buildings at the Exposition Grounds is Better Than Even Contractors Expected.</head>
                            <p>People who desire to visit the exposition grounds these days should go with waders.  The warm weather of the last few days has succeeded in thawing all the snow and a good bit of the frost that was in the ground, and this and the fact that the dirt has been recently uncovered and is loose has conspired to transform the entire grounds into a sea of mud.  On account of this visitors are not very numerous.</p>
                            <p>The Manufactures building again shows this morning advance in progress.  In fact, it is almost ready to pass completely from the hands of the carpenters.  There are a few window casings to be put in and a few roof supports to be erected, and that is about all.  The scaffolding in the interior is being taken down today and the painters have made their appearance.  On the outside the plasterers and the staff workers are doing fast work.</p>
                            <p>Progress is to be noted upon all the other big buildings.  The Agriculture building will be completely roofed over by the early part of the next week.  One of the trusses of the roof in the Liberal Arts building was raised this morning and the roof will be pushed from now on.  On the west end of the Mines and Mining building the two cupolas are up in framework and a dozen flag staffs have been erected upon and about them.  Workmen have commenced to tack the staff upon the Machinery building as well as the Agricultural and Mines buildings.  The concrete steps to the porticoes of the Machinery building are also being put in place.  The balconies in the Auditorium are being built and the roof will be commenced in a few days now.</p>
                            <p>It is believed that the Fine Arts building can be commenced in a couple of days or by the first of next week at the most.  Almost all the light timbers and the roof timbers have arrived, another carload coming in this morning.  The heavy beams that are needed first have not yet arrived, although they have been on the road for a week now.</p>
                            <p>The little engine house, now located between the Liberal Arts and the Fine Arts buildings, but which is to be moved next spring to the Bluff tract, is very nearly finished.  The staff will not be put on it until in the spring, but as soon as it is completed a chemical engine and four firemen will be housed in it.</p>
                            <p>The first flag to be thrown out on the grounds was flying from the top of the Nebraska building this morning.  This structure has been rushed fastly.  The big dome and the little ones are almost all roofed over and the entire building is almost enclosed.</p>
                            <p>Eastman &amp; Smith, the staff contractors for half a dozen of the buildings, have ready almost all the ornamentation for the buildings.  The pieces for the Mines and Mining, Agricultural and Machinery buildings are very nearly all completed and will be ready to be tacked on as soon as the carpenters can get out of the way.</p>
                            <p>The toboggan slide is pretty nearly ready for the carnival.  The framework is all up down to the ice and in a day or so it will be planked over.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Committee Named by Manufacturers' Association Takes Formal Shape.</head>
                            <p>The Transmississippi and International Exposition seems to have taken a firmer hold on the business men of St. Louis than any exposition in recent years.  The interest shown by the merchants and the manufacturers there is all the more noteworthy because of their non-participation in the Tennessee centennial and their recent labors for their own St. Louis exposition.</p>
                            <p>The committee of merchants and manufacturers appointed at the recent open meeting called by the St. Louis manufacturers to provide for St. Louis exhibits at the exposition held its first business meeting in St. Louis on Tuesday evening.  One of the first things done was to change the name of the new organization to that of the St. Louis commission for the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha.  This change was suggested by Chairman C. H. Sampson and adopted through a motion offered by L. D. Kingsland.  The suggestion of the election of a permanent secretary of the commission resulted in the selection of F. H. Sterritt.</p>
                            <p>A business-like discussion of the best plan of proceeding resulted in the acceptance by the commission of the invitation from President Wattles of the Omaha exposition to visit Omaha and to inform themselves of the exact conditions there, in order that they may be able to give all necessary information from their personal knowledge to St. Louis exhibitors.  The commission then arranged for its detailed work by providing for ways and means and other important committees to be appointed by the chairman.  Among those present were C. P. Walbridge, W. H. Moore, L. G. Branch, H. P. Todd, E. S. Lewis, T. A. Mysenburg, E. G. T<unclear/>on, Ben Altheimer, Goodman King, E. Michael and Norris Gregg.</p>

                            <head type="main">IOWA'S MAIN ARRANGEMENTS</head>
                            <head type="sub">REPORT OF COMMISSIONER PACKARD</head>
                            <head type="sub">Special Commissioner Gives in Detail to the Commission the Result of His Recent Visit to Omaha.</head>
                            <p>Ex-Governor Packard, who headed the committee of the Iowa exposition commissioners which recently came to Omaha and arranged for space at the grounds for an Iowa building and for space in the main buildings for an Iowa exhibit, has made his report to the commission.  He gives in detail the controversy that led to the visit of the committee to Omaha and he recounts the experience of the committee while here, telling of the very satisfactory arrangements concluded between the executive committee of the exposition and the Iowa committee.  He describes the sites on which Iowa has an option for a building and says: "It goes without saying, however, that Iowa will need a $20,000 building on either side to not look seedy in such a company."</p>
                            <p>His report concludes as follows:</p>
                            <p>Relating to space in the exposition buildings, we approve the space that has been hid in reserve for Iowa, namely: one of the four corners on the main intersecting aisles or passageways in <choice><sic>he cener of he agriculural</sic><corr>the center of the agricultural</corr></choice> building.  Nebraska has been assigned one corner, Iowa one, Illinois one and Wisconsin <choice><sic>he oaher</sic><corr>the other</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>It is expected that the states <choice><sic>wil lhave</sic><corr>will have</corr></choice> structures in which to install their exhibits&#8212;something <sic>aof</sic> the World's fair plan&#8212;in the Agricultural building.  No diagram of floor space was ready <choice><sic>foir</sic><corr>for</corr></choice> the Horticultural building, but 2,000 feet will be held for us, to be located by us when ready.  Suitable space <choice><sic>wil lbe</sic><corr>will be</corr></choice> reserved for our exhibit in the Mines building.  Relating to the dairy exhibit, it seems to have been thought that a short time exhibit of dairy products might be made in September in the interest of economy.  We spent the forenoon Saturday in company with the secretary of the Nebraska commission in making a protest to the exposition management against such a plan.  We requested the management to provide a competitive dairy exhibit to open June 1 and close with the exposition, with cash prizes for the best exhibits, and with refrigerating space and cold room storage for exhibitors' products.  Prof. Taylor of the Agricultural department will second our request, though the department is under the charge of Mr. Dinsmore, who was absent from Omaha.  June and July classes, as well as September and October, would, it is believed, bring out a better butter exhibit than was shown at the Chicago exposition.  The live stock exhibit will occur in October, so as to not interfere with the state fair circuits.</p>
                            <p>Our materials, selected this year from the glowing crops for decoration and for the agricultural and horticultural exhibits, now in store room at Council Bluffs, seems to be well protected and in good condition, but I would suggest that the boxes be shifted from one side of the store room to the other once a month to guard against the attack of <choice><sic>rate</sic><corr>rats</corr></choice> and mice, though there are no appearances of their presence.</p>
                            <p>The apples in cold storage may need to be sorted and wrapped with paper as they are repacked.  The storekeeper reports that some of the apples were at the station for two <choice><sic>o rmore</sic><corr>or more</corr></choice> days in very hot weather before they were placed in the cold room, and he thinks that they are not in condition to keep until June next.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Work Hustles Right Along at the Exposition Grounds.</head>
                            <p>It is cold and raw and damp out on the exposition grounds, but the work on the buildings goes on as usual.  The workmen failed to shed their coats and many of them wore gloves, but even with this protection the cold northeast wind chilled those on the tops of the big buildings.  The one advantage of the weather was that the mud and slush on the grounds was frozen tight and it was possible for the few visitors to get about without wading.</p>
                            <p>Workmen have commenced to put the tar paper upon the roof of the Mines and Mining building.  The interior of this structure shows considerable evidence that it is approaching completion.  There are but few carpenters at work on the inside and these have advanced so far that the railing is being put around the balcony.  Almost the entire force is engaged on the big entrance and upon the two towers at the east side.  The walls have been lathed and are almost ready for the plasterers, both on the inside and the outside.</p>
                            <p>The roof of the Manufactures building, the one nearest completion except the Administration Arch, has also been covered with tar paper.  The window casings are being rapidly put in, the painters still being engaged on the few that are left.</p>
                            <p>A good start has been made on the Government building.  The wall girders for the north half are up and the workmen are engaged on the beams for the flooring.  This half of the building will be well on the way before the piling for the other half is driven.  The wings have been laid out and the places where the piles are to be driven marked.</p>
                            <p>The carpenter work on the interior of the Nebraska building is almost completed and the outside work is very near the same stage, although some of the cupolas have not been completely roofed.  After tomorrow night all that will be left to be done will be some small details and the erection of the pillars.  As a consequence a portion of the carpenter force will be laid off.  The roof of the building is all ready for the mica roofing, which will make it shine like silver in the sun.  This material is now on the way.  The plasterers will be at work next week if the weather permits.  Painters have started upon some of the roof woodwork which will not be covered with the mica.</p>
                            <p>Work is being done on the corner pavilions and the entrance to the <choice><sic>Agriculaural</sic><corr>Agricultural</corr></choice> building.  The work on the roof of this structure is going ahead rapidly.</p>
                            <p>By tomorrow all the roof girders will be placed in Machinery hall.  There are but a couple more to be fastened.  As soon as they are in place the roof will be pushed rapidly.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi association held the regular weekly session last evening.  The secretary was instructed to call a meeting of the finance committee at once and get the work of raising $5,000 under way on the lines previously agreed upon.  President Graham, William Moore and E. H. Walters were appointed an auditing committee.  A copy of the articles of incorporation signed by a sufficient number of the members was presented together with the report of the secretary and president announcing that the papers had been filed for record in the office of the secretary of state, and the association now has a legal status and existence.</p>
                            <p>The secretary presented the application for space on the exposition grounds, and the association authorized the president and secretary to sign the same and return it to the Omaha management.  The requisition for space calls for a tract seventy-five feet square and the purpose designated is the erection of a mammoth Indian wigwam seventy-five feet in diameter and ninety feet high.  The application was signed at once and will be forwarded by mail today.</p>
                            <p>The committee having charge of the matter of fixing the salary of the secretary reported that satisfactory arrangements had been made by which Secretary Judson will devote half of his time to the work of the association.  This covers a period of two months.  After that when more of his time will be required other arrangements will be made that will be satisfactory to him and to the association.</p>
                            <p>Luncheon was served during the evening.  The next meeting will be held on Thursday night, when luncheon will again be served.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Frank Dietz Discusses an Important Subject Informally.</head>
                            <p>Frank Dietz, who is at present in Omaha in the interests of Mme. Nordica, has submitted to the manager of the Department of Ways and Means an informal proposition regarding the public amusements of the exposition.  Mr. Dietz urges an early consideration of his proposition.  In regard to it, he says: "Public amusements, if legitimately managed, are one of the largest sources of income to any exposition.  The proper location of a large out-of-door attraction should be considered in connection with the laying out of the grounds and the location of the buildings.  Then there is the still more important consideration of accommodation of the public.  <choice><sic>Hom</sic><corr>How</corr></choice> many seats shall there be?  The vast majority of visitors would willingly pay a small extra charge, not necessarily as an admission fee, but for the sake of securing an undisturbed and uninterrupted view of a spectacle which in itself is well worth the price of admission to the exposition grounds.  The financial success of any exposition depends upon pleasing and satisfying the people who come to see it.  The best and most effective advertisement of the exposition is given when the doors are open to the public.  If the visitors are impressed and delighted there is no further occasion to appeal to local interests, sectional pride, or even patriotism."</p>

                            <p>At a meeting held by the executive committee of the Transmississippi Exposition directors at the Millard yesterday afternoon a resolution was passed that the manager of the Department of Publicity and Promotion be authorized to apply to the United States postmaster general and request that a special stamp be issued, commemorative of the holding of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>A resolution was also passed to the effect that the president of the exposition be empowered to make application to the War department for the use of Fort Omaha and its buildings from May 1 to November 1, 1898.</p>
                            <p>A communication was received from Charles E. Thurman containing a proposition to place in commission a special car with a crew of fifteen men for advertising purposes.  It was proposed that the car be handsomely decorated on either side with birdseye views of the exposition and that it be supplied with 300,000 pamphlets descriptive of the big show for distribution in territory adjacent to Omaha.  The communication was referred to Managers Babcock and Rosewater.</p>

                            <p>NEW YORK, Dec. 10.&#8212;The Joint Traffic association managers have recommended a number of regulations to govern the transportation of exhibits to and from the Transmississippi and International Exposition, to be held at Omaha, June 1, 1898.  The regulations affect every road of prominence in the country.  They are comprehensive and are generally regarded as liberal in their provisions.</p>

                            <p>HOUSTON, Tex., Dec. 9.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The Nebraska delegation reached Galveston this morning and were the guests of the city the greater part of the day.  The reception was a royal one and nothing was left undone to make the visit both pleasant and profitable.  A boat ride on the gulf to the end of the jetties was the first feature, followed by a ride about town and oyster roads.  After the latter speeches were made and the Galveston people were enthusiastic about the exposition.  They assured the visitors that Galveston would be represented and would do everything to enthuse the rest of the state.  Resolutions adopted by the Houston convention were readopted.  A large leather medal was presented to Alvin Saunders as the greatest oyster eater in the crowd, with a record of 986 bivalves.  One feature of the occasion was the passing of a deed from the citizens of Galveston to Alvin Saunders, trustee for the state of Nebraska, conveying the first half mile of the jetties, covering 320 acres of wharfage.  Mayor Fly made the presentation speech and put great stress on the possibilities laid before the state of Nebraska by this transfer.  The party started for Dallas tonight and will spend tomorrow at that place.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Management of the Exposition Receives Compliment from the Committee&#8212;Favorable Report on Allen's Railroad Bill.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;This has been a field day for Nebraska.  The state has been largely to the front, not only in matters of legislation, but has secured two reports from the committee on Indian affairs of vital interest to the people of the commonwealth.</p>
                            <p>Senator Allen has the honor of having passed the first bill through the senate this session, that of granting to the town of Valentine, Cherry county, 720 acres for public parks, cemetery, fair grounds and other purposes, the amendment as reported from the committee on public lands being acceptable to both senators from Nebraska that when the lots ceased to be used by the town of Valentine for other uses than contemplated in the bill, the same shall revert to the United States.  The bill went through with a rush.</p>
                            <p>But what is of much greater importance, not only to the people of Nebraska but to the people of the transmississippi country, is a favorable report on Senator Allen's bill providing for the holding of a congress of Indian families at Omaha next year.  The committee on Indian affairs decided today to report on this bill favorably on Monday, appropriating $50,000 instead of $100,000 as originally contemplated, and aiding the bill in a few minor particulars.</p>
                            <p>The report of the committee, which was completed late this afternoon, states: "There has never been, so far as your committee is informed, a thorough Indian exhibit at any exposition held in the United States, and we deem it just and proper that it should be done at this one.  Indians, and therefore their customs and habits, are rapidly passing away, and it is believed this exposition will be the first and probably the last opportunity the people of the United States will have to see the aborigines in their various stages of development and perceive their habits, customs and the advancement they have made toward civilization under our present system of national education."</p>

                            <p>The letter which Senator Allen received from Major J. W. Powell of the Ethnological Bureau and Herbert O. Welch, secretary of the Indian Affairs association, are made a part of the report.  The report further says, in citing the act appropriating the money for making a government exhibit:</p>
                            <p>"The entire sum of money required by that act has been raised and many thousands of dollars besides, grounds have been selected, many buildings have been constructed and many others are in process of construction, and the exhibition bids fair to be the largest to which the government has in any manner contributed since the Columbian exposition of 1893."</p>
                            <p>The committee on Indian affairs decided also to report favorably Senator Allen's bill granting a right of way to the Omaha Northern Railway company to construct a railway across and establish stations on the Omaha and Winnebago reservations in the state of Nebraska.  The report will say: "This is a genuine incorporation and the committee has every reason to believe that the road will be constructed within the time contemplated in the bill and that its construction and operation are much needed."</p>
                            <p>The house committee on foreign affairs at its meeting today had before it the senate concurrent resolution passed at the last session of congress, calling upon the president of the United States to invite foreign nations to participate in the Omaha exposition next year, and a subcommittee composed of Gillett of Massachusetts, Heatwole of Minnesota and Berry of Kentucky was appointed to report on the same to the full committee.  In view of the fact that invitations have been extended to foreign nations, it is thought that Representative Mercer will suggest an indefinite postponement of this measure.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The exposition delegation to Texas and Kansas City arrived home at 7:15 o'clock last evening, the train being delayed on account of its extra load of specials and bad weather.  At Kansas City yesterday morning the delegation from Lincoln and South Platte points took the direct route for home.</p>
                            <p>Every member of the delegation was in excellent health and spirits and well satisfied with the work accomplished.  In evidence of this, though loaded down with bags of pecans and other nuts, sugar cane and every kind of souvenir of the trip, they sang the exposition "Hot Time" song for the edification of waiting friends at the depot.</p>
                            <p>The courtesy shown the delegation from the beginning to the end of its trip was constant and of the heartiest kind.  In Fort Worth, Houston, Galveston, Dallas and other Texas points visited the papers gave full reports of the meetings and interviews with delegates on the exposition.  All of the Kansas City papers of yesterday gave lengthy reports of the reception and meeting there Saturday night, three of them devoting a considerable portion of their front pages to doing so and all talking favorably of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>The delegation took Kansas City, as well as the cities and towns of Texas, by storm, and the business men of it have determined to stand first of any city in the matter of a building and exhibit at the exposition, C. D. Parker, chairman of the Kansas City Commercial club committee, appointed to select a site for the building, said yesterday morning that he would have to leave at once for Chicago, but that the committee would be in Omaha within ten days to select a site, in which work he was promised the assistance of the delegation.</p>
                            <p>The Kansas City Star of yesterday said on this subject:</p>
                            <p>"The visit of the Nebraskans and what they said about the Trans-Mississippi exposition created a decidedly favorable impression on the members of the Commercial club and will no doubt result in Kansas City being well represented at the exposition.  The project, mentioned last week, of having a Kansas City building at Omaha, seems to meet with the favor of those who have taken an interest in the fair, and it now seems probable that in addition to the Missouri building which will doubtless be built Kansas City will have a special building and exhibit."</p>
                            <p>As previously reported in the dispatches from Dallas and other points, the state and municipal authorities of Texas were aroused to enthusiasm for an exhibit at the exposition, and the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway company has asked the other railroads in Texas to join it and the business men of the different cities having a Texas building and fine exhibits of all of the many natural resources of the state.</p>

                            <p>One of the features of the trip was the singing, in which all of the delegates participated.  There were several songs and yells, and as the talent of the delegates seemed unlimited, verses were constantly being added or left out, to suit the occasion and the city.  One of the most popular was to the air of "A Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight," and was in part:</p>

                            <head type="sub">ENOUGH MONEY IN SIGHT TO ERECT IT</head>
                            <head type="sub">Commercial Club Will Send a Committee to Omaha Soon to Select the Site for the Structure.</head>
                            <p>One of the direct results of the journey of Nebraskans through the states lying to the southward of Nebraska will be the erection of a Kansas City building on the exposition grounds.  The city on the Kaw is thoroughly aroused to the situation and its citizens are more than favorably impressed with the magnitude and importance of the Transmississippi Exposition to the states in this region.  They are strongly in favor of a state exhibit by Missouri, and say they will do all in their power to bring about a state exhibit that will show to the world the greatly diversified resources of the state.  In addition to this they are firmly resolved that Kansas City must have a headquarters building of its own.</p>
                            <p>The Commercial club has taken the matter in hand and has appointed a committee, of which C. D. Parker, one of the most prominent and influential members of the club, is chairman.  This committee will visit Omaha within the next ten days for the purpose of selecting a site for the building.</p>
                            <p>President Barton of the Commercial club said Saturday evening at the meeting held at the club rooms that $15,000 for a city building is already in sight and that there was every indication that the amount would be increased to $25,000 within a short time.</p>
                            <p>The birdseye view of the exposition grounds, enclosed in neat frames, hung in prominent positions in the Commercial club rooms and the members expressed the greatest admiration for the magnificence in the general plan and appearance of the grounds as shown in these pictures.</p>
                            <p>The people of St. Joseph are also awake to the importance of state representation at the exposition and prominent business men say that their city will lend all the assistance possible to an exhibit showing the natural resources of the state and the many manufacturing industries.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Educational Congress Will Get Enthusiastic Support from Them.</head>
                            <p>Much interest has been aroused among the educators of Texas in the proposed Educational congress to be held in connection with the exposition.  If the way opened is followed up vigorously Texas will be represented in the congress in a creditable manner.</p>
                            <p>At the meeting held at the Commercial club Saturday evening, December 4, just before the Nebraska delegation started on its long trip, H. R. Corbett of York, ex-superintendent of public instruction, was appointed a special representative to promote the Educational congress in Texas.  Prof. Corbett commenced his work by telegraphing to State Superintendent Carlisle of Texas, asking a meeting at Houston.</p>
                            <p>When Prof. Corbett reached Houston with the rest of the party he found Superintendent Carlisle and a number of other men prominent in educational affairs, who were in Houston in attendance upon some of the numerous conventions then in session.  A meeting was held at which Prof. Corbett explained the plan and scope of the Educational congress and also the educational exhibit at the exposition.  The Texans recognized the desirability and importance of the congress and manifested great interest in the matter.  They stated that the meeting of the State Association of School Superintendents will be held at Temple December 28, and all of them promised to lend their aid in impressing upon the members of that association the importance of state representation.  This is the most important state educational association in the state.</p>
                            <p>At Dallas Prof. Corbett had a lengthy interview with Superintendent Long of the Dallas schools, who is recognized as one of the most prominent men in educational affairs in Texas.  He has been for many years in charge of the school exhibits at the Texas state fairs.</p>
                            <p>"There is no man in Texas," said Prof. Corbett, "who knows so well how to secure fine exhibits of the schools of that state.  He told me he knew where the very best material could be secured with the least trouble and he said he could be depended on to do anything in his power to assist in making a creditable exhibit.  He thought well of the Educational congress and said he would render all the assistance in his power, both at the meeting of the state association at Temple and elsewhere."</p>

                            <p>As a result of the efforts being made to arouse interest in the exposition among the people of Philadelphia the bourse of that city on December 7 adopted the following resolution, which was forwarded by F. F. Ford, who has been actively engaged in promoting the exposition in the City of Brotherly Love:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, From information received as to the character and extent of the Transmississippi and International Exposition, to be held at Omaha during 1898, it would appear that the business and social relations now existing between that section and the city of Philadelphia would be improved and extended by an <choice><sic>edequate</sic><corr>adequate</corr></choice> representation by our city and by our manufacturing interests therein.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the Philadelphia bourse commends the Transmississippi and International Exposition to the careful consideration of our municipal authorities and of the manufacturers of Philadelphia, with the hope that our city will be represented in a manner suitable to the dignity and importance of the municipality.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Exhibits will ask the Treasury department to make rules and regulations and quarantine regulations governing the admission of foreign live stock for exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The Illinois Exposition commission has made formal application for 1,000 feet of space for a state exhibit covering its agricultural, horticultural and dairy interests.  The application was received from Secretary Hambleton this morning.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission will hold its regular semi-monthly meeting tomorrow evening at its headquarters in the Millard hotel.  Bids will be opened for the plastering, staff work and statuary on the Nebraska building.  There is little other business of importance to come before the commission at this meeting.</p>
                            <p>Prof. F. W. Brewer of Logan, Utah, sanitary commissioner for the exposition, has notified the Department of Exhibits that he has been seriously delayed in his work by the sickness and death of his wife, but that he will take up his work with vigor and push it with all his power.</p>
                            <p>Plans and specification for the Power building at the north end of the bluff tract are still in the hands of the architects-in-chief and will be ready for the contractors by the latter part of this week.  The foundations for the boilers and engines are already in place and the work of erecting this building will be pushed as rapidly as possible in order that the boilers may be installed at once.</p>
                            <p>Interest in the horticultural features of the exposition is increasing very materially among the fruit growers of that section.  Mr. Spencer says that all the people in that section of the state are making preparations to have a fine exhibit of their products and he says they will use every effort to distance all competitors.</p>
                            <p>Grace Espey Patton, superintendent of public instruction for Colorado, has taken up the work of preparing for an exhibit of the educational interests of the Centennial state.  She has announced that she will at once appoint assistants in the various sections of the state and will lay the matter of making a creditable state exhibit before the State Teachers' association at its next meeting.  Sloyd and kindergarten work will be made prominent features of the exhibit and the manual training school and School of Mines will be asked to join in the work.  It is announced that about 1,000 feet of space will be filled with the educational exhibit.</p>

                            <p>Senator Allen has the honor of having passed the first bill through the senate this session, that of granting to the town of Valentine, Cherry county, 720 acres for public parks, cemetery, fair grounds and other purposes, the amendment as reported from the committee on public lands being acceptable to both senators from Nebraska that when the lots ceased to be used by the town of Valentine for other uses than contemplated in the bill, the same shall revert to the United States.  The bill went through with a rush.</p>
                            <p>But what is of much greater importance, not only to the people of Nebraska but to the people of Nebraska but to the people of the transmississippi country, is a favorable report on Senator Allen's bill providing for the holding of a congress of Indian families at Omaha next year.  The committee on Indian affairs decided today to report this bill favorably on Monday, appropriating $50,000 instead of $100,000 as originally contemplated, and aiding the bill in a few minor particulars.</p>
                            <p>The report of the committee, which was completed late this afternoon, states: "There has never been, so far as your committee is informed, a thorough Indian exhibit at any exposition held in the United States, and we deem it just and proper that it should be done at this one.  Indians, and therefore their customs and habits, are rapidly passing away, and it is believed this exposition will be the first and probably the last opportunity the people of the United States will have to see the aborigines in their various stages of development and perceive their habits, customs and the advancement they have made toward civilization under our present system of national education."</p>

                            <p>The letter which Senator Allen received from Major J. W. Powell of the Ethnological Bureau and Herbert O. Welch, secretary of the Indian Affairs association, are made a part of the report.  The report further says, in citing the act appropriating money for making a government exhibit:</p>
                            <p>"The entire sum of money required by that act has been raised and many thousands of dollars besides, grounds have been selected, many buildings have been constructed and many others are in process of construction, and the exhibition bids fair to be the largest to which the government has in any manner contributed since the Columbian exposition of 1893."</p>
                            <p>The committee on Indian affairs decided also to report favorable Senator Allen's bill granting a right of way to the Omaha Northern Railway company to construct a railway across and establish stations on the Omaha and Winnebago reservations in the state of Nebraska.  The report will say: "This is a genuine incorporation and the committee has every reason to believe that the road will be constructed within the time contemplated in the bill and that its construction and operation are much needed."</p>
                            <p>The house committee on foreign affairs at its meeting today had before it the senate concurrent resolution passed at the last session of congress, calling upon the president of the United States to invite the foreign nations to participate in the Omaha exposition next year, and a subcommittee composed of Gillett of Massachusetts, Heatwole of Minnesota and Berry of Kentucky was appointed to report on the same to the full committee.  In view of the fact that invitations have been extended to foreign nations, it is thought that Representative Mercer will suggest an indefinite postponement of this measure.</p>

He is also in receipt of a letter from Chief Executive Officer Kemper of the architect's office, stating that the walls of the South Omaha postoffice up to the first floor line are to be faced with granite, the superstructure to be of pressed brick with terracotta trimmings.</p>

This is the largest city in the state and the last stop the party will make before reaching Kansas City.  The stop here has aroused an interest and enthusiasm in the exposition even more emphatic than has been shown at other Texas points.  The party arrived about noon and was met at the depot by a large delegation of business man, headed by Mayor Barry, who made them an address of welcome.  After visiting the Commercial club the party scampered over the city until 4 o'clock, when a large meeting was held at

                            the Commercial club rooms.  Alvin Saunders of Omaha, L. W. Colby of Beatrice, L. L. H. Austin of Lincoln and ex-Governor Sherman of Iowa made short talks and explained to the people of Dallas the object of the visit and the importance to Texas of the exposition.  The sentiments of Dallas were expressed by ex-Governor Gibbs, who said the people of Texas owed a debt of gratitude to Nebraska for assistance in every effort Texas had made to secure deep water improvements and he promised that the state should be at the exposition with a creditable exhibit.  Colonel Crawford of Dallas and other speakers expressed similar sentiments.  General Passenger Agent Crush of the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas railroad said his road would ask and insist that the other Texas roads join in it making a state exhibit and he pledged the Nebraska delegation that this would certainly be accomplished.</p>
                            <p>The Glee club of the Nebraska part carried the Texans off their feet here, as at other points, by singing the exposition songs set to the tuned of "Dixie" and "A Hot Time in the Old Town."  After the public meeting a brief session of the Commercial club was held and a motion made by ex-Governor Gibbs was carried unanimously pledging the club to take up at its next meeting the matter of making a Texas exhibit at the exposition.  Governor Culberson was in Dallas today and conferred with the delegation regarding the exposition.  He said Texas must be represented and promised to use every effort to bring that about.  The party left Dallas at 10 o'clock tonight and is due in Kansas City at 5:30 p. m. tomorrow.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Work on the Government Building Not Progressing According to the Rules Under Which Others Were Erected.</head>
                            <p>There is a possibility of more labor trouble on the exposition grounds, the principal figure this time to be Contractor Moore of the Government building.  Labor leaders say that he is working his men at non-union wages and during non-union hours and they propose to put a stop to it.</p>
                            <p>There are now employed in the government building some twenty-five or thirty men.  Almost the entire force was brought to this city by Contractor Moore.  The biggest part of the force are styled common laborers and they are being paid by the hour at the rate of 12½ cents.  Labor men say, however, that these men are really doing carpenter work and moreover that they are being worked nine and ten hours a day.</p>
                            <p>President Bell of the Central Labor union was investigating the matter this morning.  He says that the working of the men more than eight hours can be easily settled since it is contrary to the United States laws, which provide for an eight-hour work day.  If Contractor Moore does not shorten the hours, President Bell stated that the matter would be brought to the attention <choice><sic>fo</sic><corr>of</corr></choice> the district attorney.</p>
                            <p>Contractor Moore says he is paying his men the wages for which he can secure hundreds of others in this city.  He admits that on some days he works his force nine and ten hours, but he says that the general average for the week is not more than eight hours a day.  Moreover,, he contends that he and his workmen want to get the building finished as soon as possible, in order to get home, and since the latter are working by the hour, he does not see how it is the union's or anybody <choice><sic>elese's</sic><corr>else's</corr></choice> business how many hours a day they work.  More than that, he fears that the good weather will not continue, and therefore he wants to rush the outside work as quickly as possible, in order to get the building under cover.</p>
                            <p>The objectionable labor consists almost entirely of colored men, who have been brought here by the contractors.  It is said that the local union men have approached them in the effort to induce them to join unions and stand up for the union schedule, but these attempts have so far been fruitless.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>At the regular meeting of the directory of the Transmississippi and International Exposition yesterday afternoon at the exposition headquarters two resolutions were passed with the view of securing the prompt payment of subscriptions that are past due.</p>
                            <p>The first resolution to this effect was introduced by Charles F. Weller, and was passed without objection.  It instructs the president of the directory and the chairman and of the Department of Ways and Means to proceed at once with the collection of all unpaid subscriptions, the officers designated are authorized to do so without further delay.</p>
                            <p>To give emphasis to the demand of the treasury of the exposition for more money, a second resolution with the same end in view was introduced by General Charles F. Manderson, and was unanimously adopted.  This resolution authorizes the secretary of the exposition to publish a list of all subscribers and donors of money, and opposite each name the amount subscribed, the amount called for, the amount paid in and the amount unpaid, on January 15, 1898, in The Omaha Bee, the Omaha World-Herald, the Omaha Labor Bulletin and the Western Laborer.</p>
                            <p>The need for money to carry on the work of the exposition was the central theme of the meeting.  In the report of the Department of Ways and Means it was stated that there was a cash balance of $32,095 on hand and $42,000 outstanding to collect.  During the month just passed $2,305.50 had been collected.  The amount of $10,165 represented the assessments levied against members of the directory, which remained unpaid.  General Manderson said that great progress was being made in all departments of the exposition that involved the expenditure of money, but not so much could be said for the collection of subscriptions.  He said between now and June 1, 1898, it would be necessary to raise $250,000, and he thought those who had promised to aid the management in the work of the exposition but who now refused to pay their subscription, should have their names published in the daily press.</p>

                            <head type="sub">LIBERAL SUBSCRIPTIONS PROMISED.</head>
                            <p>Reports from all departments were received and placed on file.  All were of considerable length, and showed that great progress was being made.  Z. T. Lindsey of the Department of Ways and Means reported the result of the recent eastern trip of a committee, consisting of Messrs. Herman Kountze, Edward Rosewater and himself.  The death of George M. Pullman had delayed the subscription of the Pullman Palace Car company, but Acting President Lincoln and Vice President Wickes had given assurances that a liberal subscription would be forthcoming.  George Gould, president of the Missouri Pacific railway, promised to lay the matter before the next executive meeting, to be held soon, and said he would personally recommend a good sized subscription.  Winslow S. Pierce, general attorney of the Union Pacific reorganization committee, said that the new owners of that railroad would liberally aid the exposition as soon as the work of reorganization had been fairly begun.  General Eckert of the Western Union Telegraph company gave a promise of a subscription.  The Postal Telegraph company preferred to wait until the Western Union had subscribed, and in the same way the Wagner Palace Car company wished to hold back until the Pullman company had subscribed.  The owners of the Ames' estate and other holders of Omaha real estate made various promises regarding subscriptions that would soon come along.</p>

                            <p>The report of Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion showed that a great amount of work had been done in the last four weeks, greater than during any similar period since the establishment of that department.  Illustrated pamphlets to the number of 20,734 had been  sent out exclusive of those issued to Omaha business houses for distribution.  Birdseye prints of the exposition grounds to the number of 4,000 had been issued, and 2,700 pieces of advertising sent south with the recent delegation of Nebraskans.  The states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa and Missouri had been especially well covered with advertising matter during November.  Preparations had been completed for elaborate write-ups in a number of leading journals and magazines, including McClure's, the Cosmopolitan, the Scientific Monthly and the Ladies' Home Journal.</p>
                            <p>The support of the exposition throughout the German press has been liberal.  A sixteen-page pamphlet advertising the exposition had recently been published in France.</p>
                            <p>Under the head of promotion the trip of the local party to Texas was commended.  Commissioner Richardson's work in Missouri and St. Louis was highly spoken of.  The progress made by the states of Illinois, South Dakota, Wyoming, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Utah, Georgia and Louisiana towards creditable displays of the products and manufactures of those states was mentioned.  Fifty-three annual conventions had been secured for Omaha next year.  United States consuls throughout Europe and Asia had made favorable reports regarding the exhibits by foreign manufacturers.  Mr. Rosewater recently had an interview with the Chinese minister, who assured him that that empire would make a good exhibit and would send a representative to Omaha to look over the ground.  The Canadian government had decided to erect a building on the grounds, and favorable reports regarding exhibits had been received from Mexico, Venezuela and Bolivia.  The governor of Massachusetts had promised the aid of that stat, and steps were now being taken to secure the appointment of a commission from New York state.  The government had shown its further interest in the exposition by the aid given to the movements for the issuance of a special postage stamp commemorative of the exposition and for the holding of an Indian congress here next summer.</p>

                            <p>Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds reported great progress within the last month.  A large number of trees had been planted on the bluff tract, sewers had been completed on the grounds, and boilers would soon be in place.  The force of workmen on the grounds had been reduced to a minimum, and would not be increased until the spring weather permitted further work on the grounds.  Two extra guards had been employed.  The fire department had been instructed to furnish a two-horse chemical engine and three men for fire protection, and a building to house them now being built.  Henry Rustin had been appointed superintendent of light and power, and had recently held a consultation with prominent electrical firms in New York regarding the work of illumination.  Progress had been made on all the buildings, as shown in the daily reports by the press.</p>

                            <p>Manager Babcock of the Department of Transportation said that the Western Joint Traffic association had on November 2 agreed to transport all exhibits to the exposition at regular rates and to return them free over the same route.  Similar concessions had been granted by the Transmissouri Freight Rate committee, the Transcontinental Freight association, the Southwestern Traffic bureau the Southeastern Freight association and the Central Freight association.  This concession had been secured from all railroads in the country excepting those belonging to the Joint Traffic association, between Chicago and the Atlantic seaboard, and favorable arrangements with them were expected.  The Nebraska railroads had made additional concessions, agreeing to transport to and from the exposition free of charge all agricultural exhibits from this state.  The Mexican, the Canadian, the Quebec, the Cuban, the Coastwise and the New York and Cuba steamship lines had granted half rates for all exhibits.  The most important concession obtained was that of getting in foreign exhibits through New York, Philadelphia and other leading ports of entry without the usual brokerage on foreign shipments suspended.</p>

                            <p>Manager Reed of the Department of Concessions reported that ten concessions had been given out and applications for additional concessions had been received in sufficient number to more than fill the space on the Midway allotted to the department.  The entire space at the command of the department amounts to 4,500 lineal feet on the Midway.  Of this 1,559 feet, or about 33 per cent, has already been taken.  Applications for other concessions are being carefully examined.</p>
                            <p>In the absence of Manager Bruce of the Department of Exhibits his report was received and placed on file, but was not read.  Then followed the discussion regarding the finances of the management of the exposition, leading up to the passage of the two resolutions previously mentioned.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Duly Organized and Officered, with Plans for an Exhibit Well in Hands of the Committees.</head>
                            <p>The state of Florida is the latest to report substantial progress toward a fine <choice><sic>exhibi</sic><corr>exhibit</corr></choice> of products at the Transmississippi Exposition.  In a letter received at exposition headquarters this morning from John D. Peabody, a son of Dr. Peabody of this city, who is now living in Florida, information regarding the organization of the state commission there and of progress in securing suitable exhibits is given which leads to the belief that Florida will be most creditably represented.</p>
                            <p>Among other things the letter states that an enthusiastic meeting of those interested in the Transmississippi Exposition was held on December 7.  At this meeting Hon. Hewitt Hill of Eustis, Fla., was elected chairman of the commission; S. Boteler Thompson of Lake City, Fla., secretary; W. W. K. Decker of Tarpon Springs, Fla., treasurer, and M. R. Marko of Orlando, Fla., James Alexander of Deland, Fla., and John D. Peabody of Ozono, Fla., additional commissioners.</p>
                            <p>Various subcommittees were appointed to look after the matter of securing exhibits.  The commission will soon be enlarged to nine members and additional names are now being considered for the positions on the commission not yet filled.  The letter concludes: "Active preparations are being made for the installation of an exhibit that no other state in the union can excel and few can equal."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Scenic Theater Proposed.</head>
                            <p>It was announced by the Department of Concessions this morning that arrangements had been practically completed for an electric scenic theater on the exposition grounds.  Visitors to the World's fair will remember an electric scenic theater which occupied a section of the Electricity building.  The scheme of this was to take the spectator through a day in the Alps, beginning with a scene before sunrise, following with a brilliant scene of sunrise, a vivid storm accompanied by thunder and lightning in the morning, a clear afternoon, twilight, sunset and last a brilliant moonlight.</p>
                            <p>The scenic theater of the Transmississippi Exposition will be similar, but will be on greater lines.  At Chicago the theater occupied a space twenty by thirty feet in the Electricity building.  Here it will take up a separate building in the amusement section, forty by ninety feet.  The theater will be operated by William Baker of Detroit, and one of the exposition officials said this morning that "the scenic electric theater will be the swell thing of the amusement section.  It is a high-class attraction of the first rank."</p>

                            <p>Only three members of the school board were present last evening at the adjourned meeting held for the purpose of reaching some conclusion concerning the scheme of enlisting the Council Bluffs school children in the effort to erect a children's building for the Transmississippi Exposition.  All were favorable to the plan, and were willing to hear the arguments that were also ready to be advanced by Mrs. Judge Reed and others, but as no official action could be taken in the absence of a quorum an adjournment was taken until next Monday evening.  It had been suggested that it would be a good idea to interest the executive committee of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi Exposition association in the work, and it is likely that an invitation will be extended to the members present at the Monday night meeting and familiarize themselves with the plans of the school children and assist in carrying them out.</p>

                            <p>In a letter received at exposition headquarters this morning from William E. Jillson of Crete, Neb., president of the Nebraska Librarians' association, a favorable report was made of the movement toward a national assembly of librarians at Omaha during the Transmississippi Exposition.  The matter will be formally presented to the Nebraskan Librarians' association, which convenes in Lincoln on December 28.  The support of the Department of Education of the exposition has been solicited in the enterprise.</p>
                            <p>In the latter of President Jillson he says: "The matter will be laid before the Nebraska librarians when they meet in Lincoln the latter part of this month.  It is hoped that they will act favorably on the matter.  The prospects seem bright for a meeting next year at Omaha of all librarians, to which eastern librarians will be very heartily welcomed."</p>

                            <p>Charles E. Hires, the young manufacturer of Philadelphia who has leaped into fame in the last five years by his extensive advertisement of Hires' root beer, has made application for a considerable amount of space for a large and novel exhibit of his summer drink.</p>
                            <p>Oscar Mosher &amp; Co. of Carlsbad, Bohemia, has made application for space in which to exhibit a line of fine glassware, of which that company is the manufacturer.</p>
                            <p>M. E. Barlow has asked to be allowed to exhibit his industry of engraving on glass by the aid of electricity and suitable space will probably be awarded this interesting business.</p>
                            <p>The Towell Syrup company of St. Paul, Minn., has requested permission from the exposition authorities to erect a rustic building fifty by twenty-five feet in order to show the public the manner in which the company manufactures its maple syrup.  The building is to be constructed of rough logs, attended by syrup gatherers and other used to lumber camps and will undoubtedly prove an interesting feature.</p>
                            <p>George O. Highman of Keokuk, Ia., has offered to exhibit at the exposition what he believes to be one of the oldest pianos now in America.</p>
                            <p>Hon. J. H. Brigham, president of the board of government exhibitions at the exposition, has recommended to H. W. Wiley, chemist of the Department of Agriculture, at Washington, that an exhibit of the machinery used in the manufacture of beet sugar be made.  In a letter to the exposition authorities Mr. Wiley says that the matter will at once be taken up and an effort made to give this growing industry the attention it merits.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Work on the Roof of Each of the Main Structures is Pushed&#8212;Two Delayed Contractors Get to Work.</head>
                            <p>"The snowstorm of a week ago has done more than anything else to hasten the work on the buildings," said Inspector of Buildings Tamms at the exposition grounds yesterday.  "As a result of the storm the contractors were called upon to pay considerable sums of money to clear away the snow that fell into the buildings, and they are making the workmen fall over each other in their anxiety to have everything ready for any other storm that may come."</p>
                            <p>Whether this is the reason or not, the fact remains that the work of roofing the buildings has been going on very rapidly during the last week.  The Machinery building, which is the nearest completion and which was covered with a roof sheathing when the storm broke, is now covered with rubberoid, so that not a particle of snow or rain can enter the roof.  The window casings are almost all in and the workmen are hanging the doors.</p>
                            <p>The top of the Agricultural building is also covered with the sheathing, and today the workmen will commence on the skylight of translucent fabric.  Upon the Mines and Mining building the rubberoid is being nailed on as fast as possible.  All but a couple of the roof girders of the Machinery building were up at noon yesterday and the work of putting on the sheathing is advancing rapidly.  Finally half the girders on the Liberal Arts building are in place and the remainder are expected to be up by tonight.</p>
                            <p>The start on the Fine Arts building has finally been made.  It has been delayed on account of the nonarrival of the lumber, but enough of the flooring finally came in to warrant a beginning.  Seven carpenters and men were put at work yesterday morning.  The contractor says that he hopes to be at work in earnest next week and promises that the work will be rushed as soon as all the timber arrives.  As many workmen as can find room in which to work will be employed.</p>
                            <p>Carpenters have commenced to lay the flooring on the first floor of the south end of the government building.  The piledriver is still driving in stakes at the north end.</p>
                            <p>The plasterers have begun in earnest on the north outside wall of the Mines and Mining building.  The carpenters on the roof have advanced so far with the cupolas at the west end that they are covering them.</p>
                            <p>Almost all the work now being done on the Auditorium is on the second floor, where the balcony seats are being put in.  The entrance at the west end is also being erected.</p>

During the last six years Mr. Morrissey has been managing the big Madison Square garden in New York City, with its great musical attractions, such as Theodore Thomas' orchestra, Anton Seidl's orchestra, The Imperial Infantry and Cavalry Bands of Germany, the great Saengerfest and Walter Damrosch's orchestra.  During the Philadelphia centennial and the Chicago World's fair Mr. Morrissey arranged and managed the "Grand Musical Congress" in the former city and managed the Imperial Bands of Germany at the German village during the World's fair.  The Philadelphia combination attracted the enthusiastic attention of the entire musical world, and was an enormous financial and artistic success.

                            <p>KANSAS CITY, Dec. 11.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The Nebraska exposition delegation was met about ninety miles below Kansas City by a committee of twenty-five from the Commercial club of this city.  On arriving the entire party were driven to the Midland hotel, where a delicious banquet was served.  The dining room and the tables were decorated with the Omaha colors.</p>
                            <p>After the banquet the Nebraskans were escorted to the Commercial club rooms.  On every side were displayed birdseye views of the Transmississippi Exposition draped with bunting, and the rooms were filled with business men of Kansas City.  Friendly greetings were exchanged and then President Barton called on Governor Saunders to address the meeting.  The governor made a brief but pointed talk on the exposition.  He was followed by L. L. H. Austin of Lincoln, who aroused the enthusiasm of the Kansas City people regarding the exposition and direct railroads to the gulf.  Robert Gilliam, chief engineer of the Pittsburg &amp; Gulf railroad, said the exposition was as important to Kansas City as to Omaha and he promised that the people of Kansas City would support the movement with all their power.  L. W. Colby of Beatrice spoke for the exposition in a happy strain, his remarks being well received.  Before the meeting closed, Councilman D. T. Mount of Omaha, on behalf of the Nebraska delegation, presented chairman W. H. Green with a handsome gold headed cane.</p>
                            <p>An active campaign has been commenced in Kansas City to raise a fund for a Kansas City building at the exposition and it is stated that the prospect for the success of the movement is very flattering.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska delegation will break up here, those from Lincoln and other points in the state going direct to their homes.  The Omaha delegates are due in Omaha at 5:40 p. m., Sunday, via the Burlington.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Contractors Hurry To Get Out of the Way of Winter, Whose Approach Has Already Been Heralded.</head>
                            <p>Work is being pushed as rapidly as possible on the exposition grounds in order that the big buildings may be under roof before another snowfall.  The snow of yesterday delayed the workmen considerably, but it was quickly cleaned away on the timbers of the roofs and every energy is being directed toward getting the upper portion of the buildings enclosed.  No attempt is being made to clear the snow from the floors of those buildings where the roof is not closed in.</p>
                            <p>The doors are being hung in the Manufactures building and the windows are nearly all in place.  The staff men are putting on the finishing touches on the outside, and very little remains to be done on the outside of this beautiful building.</p>
                            <p>Smith &amp; Eastman, the staff contractors, have completed the scaffolding about the outside of the Machinery and Mines buildings and are ready to take advantage of the first warm day to cover the outer walls with a coat of plaster.  The staff men are working in all kinds of weather, putting the decorative work on these buildings at a rapid rate.  As the work progresses it becomes more apparent to the many visitors to the grounds that they will be palaces of beauty.  The handsome pieces which are to ornament the various portions of the buildings are lying about in seeming confusion, but when the many parts are assembled they form a charming whole.  About 100 men are employed on the staff work and when the weather is warm enough to handle plaster a large number of additional men are employed to cover the plain surfaces on the buildings.</p>
                            <p>The Art building is still at a standstill on account of the delay in receiving lumber.  The man in charge of the work has stopped making predictions as to when the structure will be commenced.</p>
                            <p>Nothing was being done on the Government building this morning except to drive piles.  Contractor Raymond, who has the pile contract, said he would finish the south wing to-day and would start at the center of the building and finish the north wing as fast as possible.  Contractor Moore said his men were waiting for the pile-driver to get away from the south end before resuming work.  He said work would be pushed rapidly when this was done.  It was stated on good authority that John Latenser, who has charge of the inspection of the Government building, had notified Contractor Moore that he must work only eight hours on the building, instead of working nine hours or longer when the weather permits.  The statutes of the United States provide that on government work eight hours shall constitute a day's work, and Mr. Latenser's action was taken under this statute.</p>
                            <p>The roof is being put on the Liberal Arts building at a rapid rate.  The contractor for this buildings says he is delayed with the cornice because he had not been furnished complete drawings for this portion of the work.</p>
                            <p>The last truss for the roof of the Machinery building was raised today.  The shearing for the roof is being put on as fast as possible and the building will probably be covered by the first of next week.</p>
                            <p>The fire engine house at Twentieth street is progressing.  The doors and windows are being put in place and a temporary floor is being laid.  The building has been covered with tar paper to make it habitable and it will be ready for occupancy within a few days.</p>

                            <p>According to reports received from F. F. Ford, commercial agent for the exposition, now in New Jersey, the New Jersey Exposition commission is taking active steps to interest manufacturers in that state in that state in the idea of making an exhibit at the exposition.  The commission is visiting the several manufacturing districts and laying before the people the plan and scope of the exposition and explaining the advantages to be derived from an exhibit.  A mass meeting of the manufacturers of Paterson was planned for tonight, at which the commission was to appear and promote the exposition.  Mr. Ford reports that the people of that section are alive to the importance of the exposition and he anticipates a creditable showing.</p>

                            <p>Vilmorin, Andrieux &amp; Co. of Paris, seed dealers and extensive growers of all kinds of seeds, have made application, through their American representative, August Rhotert of New York, for space in which to exhibit their wares in the way of all varieties of seeds.  They are also manufacturers of lithograph plates for the use of florists in catalogues, etc., and they announce their intention of making an exhibit of this kind.  They desire space in the Horticulture building.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Transportation Lines of All Sorts Make Liberal Concessions to the Transmississippi and International Show.</head>
                            <p>The Department of Transportation of the exposition has about completed its work of securing concessions in the way of freight rates from the numerous associations which control the rates on nearly all of the railroads in the country and from the companies and agencies which control the steamship lines plying between this country and foreign ports.  The result shows concessions which are more favorable to the exposition, all things considered, than the rates made for any former exposition.  All of the associations have been heard from.  The Nebraska line lead with the most favorable rates, they having agreed to transport all agricultural products from points within the state to and from the exposition free of charge where such products are actually used as exhibits and have not changed hands.  Other exhibits will be transported for half rates by these lines.  All the other railroads and steamship lines have made a reduction of one-half from the usual rates, charging full rate on the going journey and returning the goods free of all charge where they have not changed owners.</p>
                            <p>One of the strongest features in connection with this feature of the work of the Department of Transportation lies in the fact that these rates have been secured some time before the time fixed for the exposition to open.  In the case of the World's fair the half-rate was not secured on a large number of lines until long after the exposition had opened, and the benefit derived from this concession was not so great as it would have been if the rate had been made earlier.  The rate secured for the Transmississippi Exposition is the same as that made for the Columbian exposition with the exception of the concessions made by the Nebraska lines on agricultural products.</p>

                            <p>The members of the Board of County Commissioners spent all of yesterday in committee of the whole considering the resolution offered by Chairman Stenberg at the last meeting of the board providing for a division of the proceeds of the $100,000 in bonds, voted at the recent election in aid of the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held in this city next summer.  The meeting was an executive one, being attended only by the members of the board, the county attorney and a committee from the Douglas County Agricultural society.</p>
                            <p>County Attorney Baldrige passed upon the legality of the right of the commissioners to appropriate money for the purpose of making an exhibit and assisting in making an exhibit.  He held that the commissioners had that right and could either assist in the construction of the buildings or in securing and placing exhibits.  Some of the members of the committee from the agricultural society were opposed to a division of the money arising from the sale of the bonds, contending that Douglas county should erect a building and make an exhibit of its own.  The commissioners argued that such a policy would be an unwise one and

                            that it would be far better to assist the exposition association than to attempt to make a separate exhibit.  Finally this view was accepted by all of the members of the board.</p>

                            <p>Whereas, The county of Douglas, by vote of the people, has authorized the issuing of bonds to the amount of $100,000 under the provisions of an act entitled "An act to authorize counties to participate in interstate expositions, to issue bonds for such purpose and to provide for a tax for the payment of such bonds; and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, An interstate exposition is to be held in the city of Omaha in the year 1898, under the name of the "Transmississippi and International Exposition;" and,</p>

                            <p>Whereas, Said Exposition company is about to construct and erect certain other large buildings for exposition purposes, among which are a Horticultural building, a Dairy building, an Apiary building and Live Stock and Poultry buildings and pens; and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, Said Exposition company has located the said buildings above mentioned upon the most desirable portion of said exposition grounds, so that no site could be selected by the county of Douglas for the erection of a separate building upon the main portion of said exposition grounds, and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The rules of the said Exposition company do not permit the erection of state and county buildings for the purpose of collective exhibit purposes; and,</p>

                            <p>Mrs. T. L. Kimball, chairman of the committee having in charge the construction of the Boys' and Girls' building of the exposition, asked for the appropriation of $5,000 to aid in the work.</p>
                            <p>County Attorney Baldrige filed a written opinion in which he held that aiding in the construction of such a building would not come within the provisions of the statute.  On this showing the request was denied and the clerk was instructed to notify Mrs. Kimball of the board's action.  The same action was taken with the request of Mrs. Keyser, who asked that the county pay the expense of placing some statuary upon the grounds.</p>
                            <p>The Omaha Fair and Speed association asked that the commissioners expend the balance of the permanent road fund in paving Linden avenue north from the Center street paving to the main entrance of the State fair grounds.  The request was referred.  The sum of about $16,000 now remains in the fund and is available.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Kierstead offered a resolution providing for the reduction of the official bond of County Treasurer Heimrod from $500,000 to $300,000, it being contended that under the provisions of law the county treasurer must settle monthly with the state treasurer, turning over at such time all public funds in his hands, thus greatly reducing the amount of money in his possession.</p>
                            <p>The resolution was adopted by a unanimous vote, after which County Treasurer Heimrod stated that prior to January 1 next he would present an individual bond.  He could not give a surety company bond, as the fee would be $1,000, while the salary of the office was but $3,000 per year.</p>
                            <p>Official bonds of a number of justices and constables, elected last November, were presented and approved.</p>
                            <p>The bond of I. F. Baxter, county judge, in the sum of $50,000, was presented and approved.  With his bond Judge Baxter presented a statement, showing that he had accounted for all money coming into his hands by virtue of his office during the last two years.</p>
                            <p>Old and uncalled for county warrants, aggregating some $300, were ordered canceled.</p>
                            <p>Sheriff McDonald reported $1,677.61 fees collected during the third quarter of the present term.  He reported the expenses of the officer during the same period at $2,080.</p>
                            <p>The county clerk was ordered to invite bids on county supplies during the next year.</p>

                            <p>A committee composed of Frank Hibbard, Union; James Walsh, McArdle; Ed Walker, Florence; O. J. Pickard, Douglas, and P. P. Mergan, West Omaha, from the Douglas County Agricultural society, appeared before the board and protested against the new officers of the society, elected last Saturday, handling any of the funds appropriated for making an exhibit at the next state fair.  Frank Hibbard, as chairman for the committee, said that the election of the officers of the Douglas County Agricultural society was unfair illegal and void, and if necessary would be contested in the court.  He contended that at the election but few, if any, members of the society voted.  The ballot box was packed by parties who had no interest in the welfare of the society.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Kierstead said that there was no hurry about going into the question of the legality of the election as the state appropriation which the society would handle would not be available until sometime just prior to the holding of the next state fair.  The exposition fund, he said, would not be disbursed by the officers of the Douglas County Agricultural society.</p>
                            <p>The views entertained by Commissioner Kierstead were accepted by the members of the board, and, as a result, all action on the election of the Douglas County Agricultural society was deferred.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Commercial Club Explains Reception Committee Plan Adopted by It.</head>
                            <p>At the meeting of the executive committee of the exposition yesterday noon at the Millard hotel a communication from the Commercial club was read, stating that the executive committee of that body had decided upon the appointment of a committee of twelve, three to be appointed by the Commercial club and three each by the exposition, the Woman's club and the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben, this committee to take up at once the question of the accommodations at hand for the entertainment of conventions, lodgings for visitors to the city during the exposition, etc.  It was stated that the Commercial club had appointed President J. H. Dumont, Chairman J. E. Baum of the executive committee and Secretary J. E. Utt as its members of this committee and the executive committee of the exposition was asked to appoint its quota of the committee.  This matter was referred to President Wattles, who stated that he would confer with members of the board of directors of the exposition and would, within the next few days, appoint three men who would serve on the committee.</p>
                            <p>Horace Plunkett of Dublin, Ireland, well known in Omaha as the representative of a strong English and Irish land syndicate, appeared before the executive committee to discuss plans for installing an Irish village on the exposition grounds.  Mr. Plunkett stated that he was interested in the project with several other Irishmen and desired to install a village which would be realistic and entertaining, after the manner of the Irish village at the World's fair.  The matter was discussed informally and was finally referred to Manager Reed of the Concessions department for the arrangement of the details.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Publicity has issued a new pamphlet descriptive of the exposition.  This publication is larger than any heretofore issued by the department, containing twenty-eight pages, besides the cover.  The reading matter is entirely new, the main facts regarding the plan of the great show and the exact status of the various sections being stated in clear, concise and brief style, covering the subject fully in the most convincing manner.  The pamphlet is embellished with thirteen half-tone engravings of the buildings, a full page engraving of the official birdseye view and another of the main court, besides small cuts of some of the state buildings.  In addition to the matter pertaining strictly to the exposition there are a number of pertinent paragraphs regarding Omaha and the surrounding country which have a direct bearing upon the exposition.  The pamphlet is a most creditable production and will undoubtedly be in great demand by those who desire to keep their friends and acquaintances posted on the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Park Board Opens Offers for the Permanent Structure.</head>
                            <p>The Board of Park Commissioners met yesterday afternoon and opened the bids on the construction of the Arch of States at the exposition grounds and the permanent bridges over the lagoon at Twentieth street.  The lowest bid in round numbers was $18,000 on the arch and $16,000 on the bridges.  The general expression of the commissioners was that the board could not afford to expend such an amount in either case, but no definite decision was made.  The board will discuss the matter with the executive committee of the exposition association today and then decide what it will do.  The following are the bids in full:</p>
                            <p>Arch of States&#8212;P. H. Mahoney, Omaha, $17,886; Peter Soderberg, Omaha, $19,870; Thomas Herd, Omaha, $23,000; Ittner Brick company, Omaha, $20,441.70.</p>
                            <p>Bridges&#8212;Ittner Brick company, $19,297.90; exclusive of iron work, $10,577; Canton Bridge company, iron work, $7,890; Wrought Iron Bridge company, Canton, O., iron work, $7,500; Youngstown Bridge company, iron work, $7,496; P. H. Mahoney, $18,230; iron work, $6,880; Kenwood Bridge company, Chicago, iron work, $8,500; West Lake Construction company, St. Louis, $21,044.</p>
                            <p>The board decided to furnish the trees, shrubs and potted plants required for the decoration of the exposition grounds.  Eighty large trees, 200 small trees and about 500 shrubs will be required for Kountze park and about 500 trees and 1,100 shrubs for the bluff tract.  There is some doubt whether the board will be able to furnish all the plants that the Exposition company desires, but the requisition will be filled as far as the resources of the board will go.  The large trees in Kountze park will probably be Canadian poplars and most of those on the bluff tract will be maples.</p>

                            <p>The Council Bluffs Board of Education held a special meeting last evening for the purpose of taking action upon the petition presented by Mrs. Reed to secure permission for a collection to be taken up to aid the Boys and Girls' building at the Transmississippi Exposition.  The request was promptly granted.  The only restriction placed upon it was the requirement that the funds should not be solicited during school hours and that but one day should be set apart for the work.  The day is to be called rally day and it is to be designated by Mrs. Reed.  Permission was granted her to have a program of special exercises in all of the schools for that day.  After the school is dismissed the children will be called upon to give their contribution.  Mrs. Reed expects to raise at least $2,000.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Contract for Plastering Let to a Lincoln Firm for a Lump Sum&#8212;University Exhibit Provided For.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The regular semi-monthly meeting of the Nebraska Exposition commission was held at the headquarters of the commission in the Millard hotel this morning.  A large amount of routine business was transacted and the commission adjourned at noon to accompany Governor Holcomb to the exposition grounds to survey the grounds and <choice><sic>nte the prgress</sic><corr>note the progress</corr></choice> which has been made <choice><sic>n</sic><corr>on</corr></choice> the Nebraska building.</p>
                            <p>A number of bids for doing the plaster and staff work on the Nebraska building and for furnishing the statuary necessary for the embellishment of the structure were opened, and discussed at length.  It was finally decided to defer action on the statuary bids until the next meeting of the board and the bid of Kimball Bros., of Lincoln on the plaster and staff work was accepted.  This firm offered to do the plastering inside and outside of the building and the staff work for the lump sum of $4,600.  The other bids were based on a price per yard in most instances, the price running from 13&#8542; to 27 cents per yard.  Chairman Neville will draw the contract with Kimball Bros., and a representative of the firm who was present agreed to commence plastering the interior of the building next week.</p>
                            <p>Superintendent Blake was instructed to lay off all men employed by him until after the plastering is finished, when a force of carpenters will be engaged to finish the interior of the building.  It was the unanimous sentiment <choice><sic>o</sic><corr>of</corr></choice> the board that no further time should be lost in completing the Nebraska building, but that the work should be pushed as fast as the weather will permit and the superintendent was instructed to govern himself accordingly.</p>
                            <p>It was announced that the ruberoid roofing material arrived this morning and Superintendent Blake was instructed to proceed at once to put the material on the roof.  The material can be handled in cold weather by storing it in a warm room until required on the roof and doing the work as expeditiously as possible.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WILL HAVE A FOUNTAIN.</head>
                            <p>Superintendent Chapin of Lincoln, in charge of the floriculture department for the Nebraska commission suggested that a fountain be placed in the center of the rotunda on the main floor of the building and that it be installed while the plastering was being done, as considerable plaster would be required in this work.  He presented several suggestions for a basin and a symmetrical design 12 <choice><sic>fet</sic><corr>feet</corr></choice> in diameter was selected.  Mr. Chapin was instructed to have the work done, the total cost for the fountain being limited to $100.  Mr. Chapin said his intention was to ask the Nebraska Fish commission for goldfish for the basin and to decorate it with aquatic plants.</p>
                            <p>C. F. Catlin appeared before the board in the interest of the plan suggested by him in a card appearing in The Bee, providing for the decoration of the rotunda of the Nebraska building with paintings and other works of art by Nebraska artists.  He informed the commission that he had good reason to believe and was confident that the Art building would be closed to all except artists of national or world-wide fame and he remarked that many of the artists of Nebraska could scarcely come in that category.  For that reason he urged that the board make provision for decorating the interior of the rotunda, and possibly other portions of the state building, with these pictures, ceramics, etc.  He suggested that the commission might offer prizes and thus secure the best grades of work.</p>
                            <p>To <choice><sic>thi sletter</sic><corr>this letter</corr></choice> suggestion the members of the commission demurred at once, saying that under the agreement with the exposition management no exhibits could be allowed in the state building, and, consequently, no prizes could be offered.  Mr. Catlin was requested to confer with the artists of the state and submit a plan at the next meeting of the board for carrying out his suggestion.</p>

                            <p>Chancellor MacLean wrote a long letter to the commission in which he asked for an appropriation to enable the University of Nebraska to prepare, ship and install its exhibit.  He explained that the university could not make an exhibit unless some way was provided for covering the <choice><sic>e xpense</sic><corr>expense</corr></choice> of these items, <choice><sic>a sthe</sic><corr>as the</corr></choice> regents were hampered in the disposition of funds.  He enumerated several items of expense, among them being $200 for an <choice><sic>a ttendant</sic><corr>attendant</corr></choice> to care for the exhibit after installation, $500 for the preparation of maps, charts, etc., $250 for installation of the exhibits, $300 for transportation, and an unknown amount for janitor service.  The board has already provided for the transportation, installation and care of the university exhibit and the secretary was instructed to notify the chancellor to that effect.  Regarding the item of $500 for the preparation of <choice><sic>m aps</sic><corr>maps</corr></choice>, charts, etc., the chancellor will be requested to appear before the commission at its next meeting and explain just what is contemplated by this item.</p>
                            <p>B. F. St<unclear/>ffer of Bellevue was appointed superintendent of the dairy department.</p>
                            <p>By order of the commission all superintendents on regular salary will be laid off at once and will not be put on the pay roll again until their services are required in the active work of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Neville notified the commission that he had <choice><sic>nformed</sic><corr>informed</corr></choice> the Douglas County Veterans' association that the commission had provided for a room for war relics in the Nebraska building, and the chairman said he had taken the liberty of saying that the commission would also accede to a request of the association for desk room and desks for the soldiers of both the north and the south in the building.  The action of the chairman was endorsed.</p>

Mr. Jones said today that the Indian office would do all in its power to make the Omaha exposition a success.  He heartily approves of Senator Allen's bill for a congress of Indian families at the Transmississippi Exposition and said if called upon he would so express himself to congress.

                            <head type="sub">Press Agent White of the Department of the Interior Makes Arrangements for a Location on Exposition Grounds.</head>
                            <p>Under instructions from Hon. Clifford Sifton, minister of the interior, Ottawa, Canada, Mr. Will J. White, press agent of the department, paid Omaha an official visit today for the purpose of conferring with the officials of the Transmississippi Exposition as to location, space, etc., for the Canadian building.  He says the management was exceedingly obliging and showed a desire to extend to the neighboring dominion every facility.  The site selected and which now only awaits official approval is a very central one in the vicinity of the Nebraska, Illinois and Iowa buildings.  It is expected that Canada will make a grand exhibit of its manifold resources, and the building will be one that will give exhibitors a great opportunity for making a display of the products of the country.</p>
                            <p>Mr. White says that Hon. Mr. Siffon had just returned to Ottawa from a ten weeks' trip to the coast leading to the Klondike, having made it for the purpose of gaining personal knowledge of the different routes.  He is described as a young man with wonderful powers of endurance, and it is said that those who accompanied him over the rocks and through the muddy defiles of the White and Chilcoot passes found him always in the lead, and no matter how hard his followers worked he was always working harder.  He is one of the most progressive politicians of Canada, and is rapidly making a name for himself for the creditable way in which he manages his department.  He has adopted a policy in the matter of opening up the great northwest of Canada that is attracting large numbers of people to that country.  Mr. White wishes it to be said that the Canadian government is well satisfied with the results from its exhibit at the State fair here, and hopes for proportionate results from the Transmississippi Exposition.  Mr. White was escorted over the grounds yesterday afternoon by Mr. W. V. Bennett, the Canadian government agent at this point.</p>

                            <head type="main">WATER FOR THE EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">MUCH OLD STRAW IS THRASHED OVER</head>
                            <head type="sub">Resolution Adopted Calling Upon City Council to Adopt Some Plan by Which Free Service May Be Had.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>For over three hours and a half last night members of the city council, a number of exposition directors, representatives of the Omaha Water Works company and other citizens of Omaha talked and argued over the proposition made by the water company to furnish the exposition with free water and to pay $20,000 in cash for the water system that has already been put in on the grounds by the exposition company on condition that the city waives its right to purchase the plant and franchise of the water works company until 1908, an extension of five or eight years, as the franchise has been differently construed.</p>
                            <p>While the meeting started out mildly enough it developed into a red hot revival of the water works fight, which resulted last spring in the offer of a settlement by the company, the refusal by the city council to accept it, the beginning of a suit to forfeit the franchise of the company and the recent loss of this case by the city.  The company's proposition was not accepted, but it was very apparently the sentiment of the meeting that some steps should be taken to assist the exposition company in securing the required water.  This sentiment was crystalized in the following resolution, which has passed:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That it is the sense of the citizens here present that the city council of Omaha should speedily pass such legislation as will procure for the exposition an adequate supply of water from the Omaha Water Works company free to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The meeting was called for the purpose of giving the city council some idea as to how the citizens of the city felt upon the proposition made by the company.  The inclement weather deferred a big attendance from being present.  The meeting was called to order shortly after 8 o'clock and Councilman Burkley was elected chairman.  The exposition directors present were first given a chance to express their views.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">PRESIDENT WATTLE'S IDEAS.</head>
                            <p>President Wattles gave a brief statement of the condition of the funds available, which showed that it was impossible to expend any money upon a water system and for water.  Therefore Mr. Wattles asserted that it was absolutely necessary that some action should be taken to secure water, since the exposition company did not have the $40,000 to establish a system and moreover could not hope to build one with that money that would give an adequate water supply, or one that would give confidence to the exhibitors.  He spoke of the proposition advanced by the water company, but did not express himself as favoring this particular plan.  He wanted something done, however, that would bring about the desired result.</p>
                            <p>Thomas Kilpatrick had also no particular plan to offer, but he said that some arrangement should be made by the council with the water works by which the exposition would be aided.  Nothing so deterred exhibitors as the fear that there was not ample water protection to protect their property.  He did not want the council to interfere with or give away any of the city's rights, nor to put the city in debt, but if the council could give any assistance indirectly it should do so.</p>
                            <p>Z. T. Lindsay said that the situation was plain&#8212;the exposition must have water and it must get it from the water works company.  He said that a private system of wells would be unsatisfactory, as it had been at the state fair.  It would be disastrous to the exposition if the water should give out with thousands on the grounds, as happened at the State fair when 40,000 people were in attendance and the temperature was at 105.</p>
                            <p>Ex-Governor Boyd was in favor of the water works company's proposition.  He thought that the proposition was a good one and ought to be accepted, since he did not believe that the people of the city were in favor of the purchase.  It had been urged that the city could not legally extend the time, but that was the company's lookout and the city would certainly lose nothing.</p>
                            <p>W. H. Roberson said that in view of the urgency of the needs of the exposition and in view of the facts that had been stated he was in favor of the proposition or some other scheme that would bring about the desired result.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">INSURANCE MAN'S STANDPOINT.</head>
                            <p>Chris Hartman viewed the situation from an insurance man's standpoint.  He said that at the present time a fire would destroy every bit of property on the grounds unless it was checked in its incipiency.  By June 1 it was calculated to have between $1,500,000 and $2,500,000 worth of property on the grounds, and the council owed it to the public to provide fire protection at once.  If insurance rates were exorbitant exhibitors would be kept away.  To prevent this it was the aim to get the minimum rates possible and yet at the present time not an insurance company would insure the property.</p>
                            <p>J. H. Macomber was in favor of the proposition because he did not believe the city would be in a position to purchase the water works in 1903.  In five years more it would be better able and in the meantime would secure the equivalent of $50,000 for the exposition and would have the benefit of $450,000 in improvements, giving work to laborers and doubling the fire protection of the city.</p>
                            <p>It was at this point that President Wattles introduced the above resolution, which was ultimately passed.  The reading of the resolution brought John D. Howe to his feet with a vigorous protest, which precipitated the heated arguments of the meeting.  He insisted in the first place that the meeting was not a representative one of the citizens and had not been advertised.  He then exhaustively considered the water company's proposition, saying it was all one-sided and in its favor.  He said that its contract required it to give the city adequate fire protection and it had failed to do so.  Its plea was that it was not able, but the city only asked it to do the best it could.  If it did not have the means to extend mains to the grounds and erect hydrants, let it buy fire engines for the exposition company.  The water works people were simply seeking to gain time.  They offered to help the exposition by giving water for a few months, but to secure this the city was asked to mortgage itself to pay executive and extortionate water rates for eight more years, which would give the company a net profit of $240,000 a year.  Finally, he warned the council that they would be violating their oaths if they were induced to accept the proposition on the grounds that they were assisting the exposition indirectly and without expense to the city when the law prevented them from giving direct aid.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles denied that the meeting had not been publicly advertised.  He undertook to refute some of Mr. Howe's arguments, but insisted that they did not come into the matter at all.  His resolution did not ask for the acceptance of the proposition, but requested the council to find some solution to the problem.  Mr. Kilpatrick also answered, since he had made the request that the council aid the exposition indirectly.  He wished to be understood as being opposed to the acceptance of the proposition if it was found that thereby the city was incurring any future expense.</p>
                            <p>Ex-Councilman Benawa said that he had always fought the water works company while in the council, but under the circumstances, when the fate of the exposition was in a measure involved, he was in favor of the acceptance of the proposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">POPPLETON PROTESTS.</head>
                            <p>W. S. Poppleton also protested at length against the passage of the resolution as an expression of Omaha's citizens.  He insisted that the meeting was not a representative one and that it had not been properly advertised.  He was emphatically opposed to the acceptance of the water company's proposition, that it was inferior to the compromise offered last February, which had been rejected by the people and denounced by almost every organization in the city.  He insisted that the extension was of vast benefit to the company, since it virtually gave it a new franchise and breathed life into over $11,000,000 of stocks and bonds which are now worthless.  In exchange for such a rich prize the company is offering a paltry return.  That the company is not very solicitous of the success of the exposition, was shown by the fact that it had subscribed only $3,000 to the stock, whereas the street railway company, a smaller corporation, had subscribed $20,000, and the gas company, still smaller, $10,000.  Mr. Poppleton threatened that the acceptance of the proposition would be fought in the courts.  "The company is trying to hold up the community under the guise of helping the exposition," said Mr. Poppleton.  "It is attempting to blackmail the people with a club to get what it was sought to get for many years without success."</p>

                            <p>These remarks brought President Woodbury of the Water Works company to his feet.  He stated that the Water Works company's proposition had not originated with itself, but had been made as a result of a request from President Wattles that some scheme be entered into by which water would be furnished the exposition free and its mains would be taken off its hands.  Mr. Woodbury said that the company did not care whether the proposition was accepted or not.  The company did not desire to expend money in improvements unless it could get benefit of it during the extension of time asked for.  Mr. Woodbury did not believe that the city would be ready to purchase in 1903.  If it were, the company would be glad to get its plant off its hands at that time.  In an answer to a question put by Mr. Poppleton, Mr. Woodbury said the company offered its improvements for two purposes.  As citizens of Omaha paying taxes and desiring to see it successful it wanted first to help the exposition and secondly to show the citizens of Omaha that it was willing to do what it could to upbuild the city.  The company itself had nothing to ask of Omaha.  Last spring it had offered to settle in order to save the expense of a lawsuit.  The city refused and lost some $400,000.  Today the company had nothing to ask, since the differences had been settled by the United States court.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Howe reiterated his argument, warming up considerably more than before.  The result was that he, R. S. Hall, attorney for the water works company, and Mr. Poppleton got into an argument that developed into personalities.  Judge J. M. Wooolworth followed with remarks in favor of the acceptance of the proposition.</p>
                            <p>He gave a brief history of the water works case, which he said was brought about by the advice of the same people who were now opposing the present proposition.  They are threatening litigation again.  During this proposed legal fight taxpayers would nave to suffer and the exposition could take care of itself.  As a taxpayer Judge Woolworth insisted that not only in the interests of the city but also of the exposition it was advisable to accept the proposition.</p>
                            <p>Ed J. Cornish spoke in favor of the proposition and J. M. Kinney against it.  At the conclusion of their remarks the resolution was finally put to a vote and passed.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Not Ready to Take Action Concerning the Arch of States.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>At the afternoon session a committee consisting of E. J. Cornish and H. E. Palmer, representing the Board of Park Commissioners, and Edward Rosewater, representing the executive committee of the exposition, appeared before the commission to present a suggestion regarding the Arch of States, the handsome structure which is designed to be the main entrance to the exposition.  Governor Holcomb was present and listened intently to the discussion.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater acted as a spokesman for the committee and informed the Nebraska commissioners that the Arch of States had been designed for a double purpose&#8212;to form the main entrance to the exposition and to remain as a permanent decorations in Kountze park as a reminder of the beauties of the exposition after that great show shall have become a thing of the past.  He said that the design contemplates a stone arch of handsome design, with the frieze ornamented by the shields of several states in the union bearing the coats-of-arms of the states rendered in the proper colors.  It was the desire of the executive committee that this arch should be formed of stone contributed for the purpose by the transmississippi states, each state contributing one course of stone, thereby making the arch truly an arch of the states, besides providing a permanent memorial of the exposition of the resources of this great section.  Mr. Rosewater said it would be a most creditable thing for the state of Nebraska to build the foundation of this structure and lay the first course of stone and then say to the other states, "Nebraska has prepared the foundation for this arch typifying the union of the states in the great transmississippi region; now come with your stone and build upon this foundation a memorial that shall endure for generations upon the site of this great exposition of our resources."</p>
                            <p>E. J. Cornish followed Mr. Rosewater and stated that the Board of Park Commissioners had agreed to expend $30,000 in permanent improvements on this portion of the exposition grounds, but has not sufficient funds to appropriate $18,000 for the construction of this arch and do the many other things that are necessary.  He said, however, that the board would provide the shields of the state which will be required in the frieze of the arch and furnish the iron work, flag poles and other items required to complete the structure.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">COMMISSION NOT READY TO ACT</head>
                            <p>Members of the Nebraska commission asked numerous questions regarding the probable cost of the work asked of them, but none of the committee was prepared to answer this question.  It was stated that the bids for the structure complete were less than $18,000, and as the building was nearly ninety feet in height the cost of the foundation and first course could form but relatively small proportion of the cost, as the foundation could be made almost entirely of concrete.</p>
                            <p>The matter was discussed informally without any member of the Nebraska commission expressing himself positively upon the idea, and then the committee was requested to secure figures from the architect and submit them for the consideration of the commission at its meeting December 28.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater suggested that if Governor Holcomb would issue an invitation to the governors of the transmississippi states, asking them to contribute one course of stone for the arch from the mineral resources of their state, all the necessary material could be secured at little or no cost.</p>
                            <p>Governor Holcomb expressed himself in the strongest terms as being in favor of doing anything reasonable to secure some permanent memorial of the coming exposition.  He said he thought it would be a great shame to put all the money into structures which will be destroyed as soon as the exposition is over and said he was strongly in favor of erecting some building that would remain to remind future generations of the great exposition.  The governor said he would gladly issue an official invitation to the governors of other states, as suggested, and would urge the matter upon them.  He suggested that the exposition executive committee take official action in the matter upon which he might proceed.</p>
                            <p>The special committee withdrew and returned in a few moments to announce that the executive committee had passed a motion to request the governor to take official action in the matter.</p>
                            <p>The governor said he would take the matter up at once and it was thought some replies might be secured by the next meeting of the Nebraska commission.</p>

                            <p>Georgia has joined the ranks of states outside the transmississippi region which will make exhibits of their resources at the Transmississippi Exposition in order to show to the world their resources and advantages.  The legislature is taking hold of the matter and the house had passed a resolution providing for the appointment by the governor of fifteen commissioners, the governor to be the chairman of the commission.  This body is charged with the task of securing and installing at the exposition an exhibit showing the resources of the state.  The Atlanta Constitution endorses the plan in a strong editorial and suggests that the state will derive direct and substantial benefit from such an exhibit, both commercially and socially.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PARK BOARD WILL RETURN THE BIDS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Arch of States and Permanent Bridges on Exposition Grounds Will Not Be Built by the Commissioners.</head>
                            <p>A majority of the Board of Park Commissioners has definitely decided that neither the Arch of the States nor the bridges across the lagoon at Twentieth street, as now designed, will be built by the board.  According to the lowest bids that have been received the arch would cost about $18,000 and the bridges $16,000.  The members of the board assert that in neither case is the prospective benefit sufficient to warrant the expenditure.  They contend that the plans provide for structures which are on altogether too massive and expensive a scale and that the expenditure proposed would be reprehensible extravagance.  They also take the position that the board could not let a construct for either of the improvements in any case because it has not the money in sight and they cannot legally let contracts on the strength of the appropriation which they expect to get next year.  President Tukey will return the bids to the contractors at once and at the next meeting of the board his action will be approved.</p>
                            <p>Members of the board state that they will readily vote to build the bridges if plans should be submitted that are more reasonable in their provisions.  They think that bridges that would answer every purpose, both of utility and ornament, could be constructed for less than $10,000, and if the expense could be kept within that limit they would readily act.</p>
                            <p>In case no such plans are submitted, there is no definite understanding in respect to the manner in which the funds that were voted to the board for the express purpose of assisting the exposition are to be expended.  One or two members are in favor of putting in a couple of handsome fountains in Kountze Park, which would not only be substantial additions to the attractions of the exposition but would also remain as permanent improvements.  They think that an elaborate fountain would be of equal practical value to the arch and would cost only a small necessary to carry out the plans that are now rejected.  This and other plans will be discussed at future meetings of the board and some action will probably be taken within a few weeks.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Seeking to Have Money Raised for a State Exhibit.</head>
                            <p>TOPEKA, Kan., Dec. 15.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Governor Leedy today addressed letters to a number of prominent Kansans asking them if they would accept places on a commission to be appointed to raise funds for a Kansas display at the Omaha exposition next year.  In the letter he says that the legislature last winter refused to make an appropriation for that purpose after he had requested it to do so and that if any money is raised for a Kansas exhibit it will have to be done by voluntary subscription, with a hope of return from the state.</p>
                            <p>The legislature failed to make an appropriation for an exhibit at the World's fair and a commission was appointed to carry on the work just as Governor Leedy proposes now.

                            <head type="sub">Famous Depictor of Western Life May Be Commissioned to Beautify Kountze Park with Typical Groups.</head>
                            <p>Captain Edward Kemys, one of the most noted sculptors of wild animals and Indians in the United States, if not in the world, arrived in Omaha this morning to confer with the management of the exposition regarding the placing of permanent statuary on the exposition grounds to remain in the public parks for all future time as memorials of the great exposition.  The idea of securing decorations for the exposition of a permanent character has been in the minds of some of the executive committee since the inception of the exposition and the matter was brought officially to the notice of the executive committee last October by a committee of the Woman's Board of Managers, which suggested that arrangements be made with Captain Kemys to make statues of various kinds and sizes, typical of western life, which could be placed in Kountze park and other city parks after the exposition shall have closed.  No action was taken in the matter at that time, but the suggestion met with favor and it is in pursuance of the sentiment then formed <choice><sic>hat</sic><corr>that</corr></choice> Captain Kemys is in Omaha.</p>
                            <p>Captain Kemys is best known to the people of this section by his famous figure of a buffalo head which graces the Union Pacific bridge over the Missouri river at this point.  This piece is considered one of the finest examples of the shaggy head of the former king of the plains now extant.  From its lofty perch it frowns upon the encroachments of the iron horse, making a picture which has furnished a theme for more than one ambitious poet.  Captain Kemys' forte lies in depicting the wild animals and wild men of the plains.  He was formerly an officer in the regular army and numerous details at frontier posts afforded opportunities for studying the American Indian in his native state.  Opportunity was also afforded for studying the wild animals which frequented the western plains before the encroachments of the white man had driven both Indian and animal to take refuge in the mountains.  The result of the investigations and study pursued under these conditions is now seen in the reputation which Captain Kemys has achieved as one of the greatest sculptors of the Indian and the wild animals of America.  The originals are fast passing away and these copies in stone will soon be all that is left of these characteristics of this continent.</p>
                            <p>Captain Kemys is accompanied by his charming wife, who has accompanied her husband on many of his trips in search of models for his figures.  She is a capital shot and possesses energy and endurance which has stood in good stead in the many exhaustive excursions through forest and plain to the lair of the wild beast.</p>

                            <p>Captain Henry C. Ward, the representative of the War department who has been detailed to take charge of the exhibit of that department at the Transmississippi Exposition, has forwarded to President Wattles a copy of his report on the operations of the Military department of the Nashville Exposition.  Captain Ward was in charge of the War department's exhibit at Nashville and was also in charge of the Military department, a department organized for the purpose of providing accommodations for the visiting military organizations.  The matter was in charge of a local committee with Captain Ward as secretary and virtually in charge of the whole matter.  Several states had the annual encampment of their militia at the exposition instead of at the usual camping place and the large number of companies and regiments from other states visited and encamped there for one or two weeks.  Several detachments of regular troops from the different arms of the service were detailed for duty at this camp and a large force was thus encamped there during the greater part of the time.</p>
                            <p>This feature of the Nashville Exposition is important in connection with the Transmississippi Exposition as showing a method of mobilizing comparatively small bodies of troops at this point in case the plan for a mobilization under the direction of the government does not materialize.  These soldiers were cared for at small expense, camp ground with tents and all the necessities of an encampment being furnished by the Military department, and meals were furnished at 50 cents per day per man, or 25 cents for single meals.  Provisions were also made for those companies which desired to have their own mess.</p>
                            <p>The report of Captain Ward shows that this feature of the exposition was very successful in every respect.</p>

He says that he also talked with a number of the manufacturers of the city and advised them to take advantage of the opportunity to make an exhibit.  A copy of a Cincinnati paper sent to President Wattles contains an account of Mr. Jones' talk before the Young Men's club in which he advised the merchants and manufacturers of Cincinnati to make a strong effort, by exhibiting at the exposition, to draw trade from the west which has been going to Chicago.</p>

                            <p>Superintendent Barwick, in charge of the construction of the Art building, was made happy this morning by the news that ten cars for lumber for that building were in the Missouri <choice><sic>aPcific</sic><corr>Pacific</corr></choice> yards and would be delivered to him at once.  The three cars on the track inside the exposition grounds were being unloaded as fast as possible and Mr. Barwick said that with this lumber and that in the other ten cars a start could be made at once on the building.</p>

                            <p>The recent visit of Assistant General Passenger Agent Cairns of the Northwestern was of considerable importance to the advertisement of the Transmississippi and International Exposition in the states covered by that system and especially in the east.  He came out to make a personal inspection of the work being done on the exposition grounds, and returned to Chicago headquarters well pleased with what he saw.</p>
                            <p>General Agent Kuhn of the Northwestern returned from Chicago headquarters yesterday.  He said that the passenger department has decided to boom the exposition throughout the central and eastern portions of the country most thoroughly.  Assistant General Passenger Agent Cairns has ordered a large number of the birdseye views of the exposition to be handsomely framed and hung in all the eastern offices of the Northwestern.  Early in the spring he will run a special train to Omaha in order to bring out all the eastern representatives of the Northwestern's passenger department to see the prospects for Omaha's great show.  They will then be sent back to their respective territories to work for exposition business.</p>

                            <head type="main">OUTLINES FOR CONGRESSES</head>
                            <head type="sub">MAIN PLANS OF WOMAN'S BOARD</head>
                            <head type="sub">Committee Maps Out the Principal Features of Its Work and Waits for the Details to Develop.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The congress committee of the Woman's Board of Managers is actively engaged in formulating plans for the congresses which are contemplated in connection with the exposition.  The committee has begun holding weekly meetings and laying out various plans of action which are pursued during the intervals between meetings.  It is seriously hampered in its work, however, by the cumbersome machinery which limits its actions and controls its movements.  The committee is the creature of the Woman's Board of Managers and its actions are subject to review by that body.  The Woman's Board, in turn, is subject, in the matter of congresses, to the Department of Promotion, and this department is compelled to refer all matters of expenditure to the executive committee of the exposition.  As the item of expense is an important factor in the organization of any congress, the congress committee is compelled to wait until its acts are approved by these various authorities before anything can be done.  As a result, the work of organizing the several movements which are expected to bring about the congresses on the many subjects under consideration is delayed in a manner which threatens to defeat the object entirely.  The committee is proceeding as rapidly as possible, however, and has outlined a general plan which is being worked out with all the speed compatible with a scheme of this magnitude.</p>
                            <p>All work thus far done by the committee lacks the <choice><sic>aproval</sic><corr>approval</corr></choice> of the various reviewing authorities heretofore referred to.  With these restrictions the committee has decided that there shall <choice><sic>b</sic><corr>be</corr></choice> congresses under three general heads, viz:  Music, art, and literature.  Other general heads will be provided for as the work progresses, but the committee has started out with these three grand divisions as a beginning.  Each of these will be subdivided into subjects pertinent to the general head.  Under the division of art, for instance, will be organized a congress on architecture, one on ceramics, and so on to the limit of the resources of the committee.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">MUCH WORK AHEAD.</head>
                            <p>A large amount of correspondence is necessary in arranging for these congresses, it being necessary to advise with people prominent in the several branches who live at different points in the country, asking their assistance and co-operation in the matter.  This requires time, and replies have not yet been received to the letters of this character which have been sent out since the committee organized.  Until these details are arranged there is little that can be said about the matter, as it may become necessary to entirely change the plans after investigation along these lines.</p>
                            <p>Three congresses have been practically determined upon, aside from those heretofore referred to.  The first is a History congress, having reference especially to the development of the history of the transmississippi region.  The committee believes that this will furnish an almost inexhaustible mine of interesting topics, such as many important but little known details regarding the "Louisiana purchase," the investigations of the history of the cliff dwellers ,and a host of other subjects of this nature.  Another subject for a congress will be "Child's Study," and it is the hope of the committee that many prominent people may be induced to take part in this congress.  A "Mother's congress" will be another gathering which will be arranged for if the fates are propitious.</p>
                            <p>The committee having the arrangement of these congresses in charge is the regular committee of the Woman's Board of Managers known as the congress committee, consisting of Mrs. Winona S. Sawyer of Lincoln, president of the board; Mrs. N. P. Feil of Omaha and Mrs. J. R. Reed of Council Bluffs.  This committee has been augmented by the addition of Mrs. T. K. Sudborough and Mrs. W. H. Hanchett of Omaha, both of whom are prominent members of the Woman's club and active workers in that organization.</p>
                            <p>This committee hold weekly meetings and portions of the work are assigned to the members which occupy their time in the intervals between meetings.  An extensive correspondence is being carried on and the committee expects to have the details worked out sufficiently within a short time to make them public.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Map for the Children.</head>
                            <p>The Bureau of Education of the exposition has issued a device which is expected to promote the interest of the rising generation in the exposition and especially in the Educational section and the Girls' and Boys' building.  The device in question is a dissected map of the United States, each state being on a separate piece of cardboard, cut along the boundary lines of the state.  These pieces fit together, making a complete map of the country and showing the rivers and towns.  Omaha is designated by a red star, which draws attention to a foot note referring to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>These maps are sold for 15 cents, each child purchasing one receiving credit for 5 cents as a subscriptions to the Girls and Boys' building.  The patronesses appointed by the Woman's Board of Managers to visit the schools in the interest of the children's building will dispose of these maps to those who wish them.  A big demand for the maps had arisen in the smaller towns in the state and the children of Omaha are beginning to call for them.  The management of the Educational bureau has an idea that these maps will prove very attractive as Christmas presents for the little ones.</p>

                            <p>In response to a call for a mass meeting of colored people issued by the Worthington Lyceum league of St. Philip, the Deacon's parish, about twenty-five persons gathered in the guild room of the church last evening.  The meeting was called for the purpose of discussing the feasibility of getting together representatives of all the colored societies in the United States, the delegates to hold a convention in this city during transmississippi year, and to discuss means whereby the white and colored races might be placed upon more friendly terms with each other than in the past.  Delegates from the Summer club, Woman's club, Women's Improvement club, Washington club, Epworth league and Masonic lodges were present.  President E. R. Overall of the league was elected temporary chairman, with H. V. Plummer secretary.  After a general discussion of the subject a committee headed by E. R. Overall was elected to take the matter in hand, investigate the same and make a report at the next meeting.</p>

The Commercial club, which originated the committee, has already appointed its portion and therefore the only members left to be selected are the three assigned to the exposition company.</p>
                            <p>The woman's board has appointed Mrs. W. L. Ross of 2121 Lake street, Mrs. George A. Joslyn of 3902 Davenport street and Mrs. Draper Smith of 620 Park avenue.  The selections of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben are E. E. Bryson, H. J. Penfold, and Water Jardine.

Mr. Paikert has had relations with the Philadelphia museums and is more or less familiar with matters in this country, and through him the consul expects to secure the interest of the government.</p>

                            <p>All the workmen on the exposition grounds were shovelling snow this morning, the gentle deposit of "the beautiful" having covered everything with a glistening mantle three or more inches in depth.  The rafters and completed roofs of the buildings were covered completely and nothing could be done until this had been swept away.  Brooms and scrapers were in demands and the air was filled with the fine particles thrown from the lofty buildings.  Work was resumed as soon as the lofty perches of the workmen had been cleared and the sun soon made the air as pleasant and bearable as an ideal winter day could well be.</p>

These bids will be laid before the executive committee at its regular meeting at noon by Manager Kirkendall.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Concessions has closed a contract with E. H. Spraue and A. J. Love of this city for the concession for Haegenbeck's trained animal show.  This will be installed on the Midway and it is promised that the exhibition will be the genuine thing.</p>

                            <p>"I have endorsed," said the governor, "to composed this committee of energetic representative business men, without regard to politics, and to have the state's leading industries properly represented to the end that a creditable display may be made of the productions and resources of our great state.</p>
                            <p>"As our last legislature made no appropriation for this purpose, the first duty of the commission will be to arouse such an interest among the business men of the cities and towns of the state as will induce them to contribute sufficient means for this purpose.  Knowing that this difficulty would have to be surmounted, my purpose has been to appoint persons in close touch with the business and industrial interests of their respective localities, persons whose state pride will prompt them to energetic effort without pay.  There is no salary in connection with the position, yet I am persuaded that the persons appointed will not be less energetic on that account.  Judging from many letters I have received on the subject, our people are fully aroused to the importance of having our state properly represented at that great exposition.  While at first thought the undertaking appears to be somewhat difficult, many others of the transmississippi states whose legislatures made no appropriations for this purpose are going ahead with their preparations and are raising expense money the same as we propose to do in this state.  Missouri surpassed all of her sister states by the magnitude and excellence of her exhibits at the World's fair at Chicago, and there is no just reason why we should not do likewise at Omaha."</p>
                            <p>The governor requests that the members meet at the Southern hotel Wednesday, January 5, to organize for active work.</p>

                            <p>Senator Allen today attempted to call up the bill appropriating $50,000 for a representative Indian exhibit at Omaha next year, but Senator Allison of Iowa requested that the bill go over until after the Christmas holidays, in order that the appropriations committee might examine into the measure more closely.  The opposition of Senator Allison is not regarded in the light of opposition to the bill, but rather a desire to inquire into the merit of the measure and to analyze what is contemplated in view of the policy of both branches of congress to hold down appropriations to the receipts of the government.</p>

Mr. Rustin is also arranging for the running of lines about the bluff tract and the north tract for furnishing light for those portions of the grounds wherever required.</p>
                            <p>There will be no unsightly line of wire strung upon poles to disfigure the plaza in front of the main buildings, but all wires necessary for supplying the arc and incandescent circuits will be placed under ground in conduits.  The arc lights will be placed on top of high poles of a handsome design, which will harmonize with the buildings.  Immense numbers of incandescent lights will be used to accentuate the architectural design of the various buildings, bringing out their several striking features in the most striking manner.  The details of this electric decoration has not yet been fully determined, this matter being in the hands of Luther M. Stieringer of New York.  Mr. Stieringer will come to Omaha early in the coming year, when the main buildings shall have reached an advanced stage, and will then determine upon the details of the plan for this decoration.  As at present contemplated, the general effect will be decidedly novel and attractive, and Mr. Stieringer expressed the greatest satisfaction when here at the opportunities for electric decoration afforded by the general arrangement of the main court.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Commissioner Packard is Very Emphatic on This Score.</head>
                            <p>Ex-Governor S. B. Packard of Marshalltown, Ia., chairman of the executive commission of the Iowa Exposition commission, is stirring up the people of his state to a realization of the importance to Iowa of the exposition to be held at Omaha next year.  He and Secretary Chase are engaged in making plans for Iowa's participation in the exposition and the governor insists that the state cannot be represented in a creditable manner without an additional appropriation of $50,000.  He says the state will be forever disgraced if the preliminary appropriation of $10,000 is not followed up by an appropriation of $10,000 is not followed up by an appropriation large enough to place Iowa at the front in the active competition between the states in this exposition.</p>
                            <p>Ex-Governor Packard is quoted at some length in the Marshalltown Times-Republican on this matter and expresses himself in the most emphatic manner.  "If we don't get more than the $10,000 we have now, we would better shut up and do nothing," he said, "for it would make every Iowan ashamed of his state.  We ought to beat all the states in this competition and it will pay us to do it.  We can do it as less expense than Illinois, because it will cost us less for transportation and we can keep our exhibits fresher.  Besides we have had experience in this work and can do it cheaper than we could before we went through the World's fair.  We are going to present two sets of plans to the legislature, one showing what we can do with $10,000, and the other showing what we ought to do to maintain our standing as a state.  Then the legislature can take its choice.  Whatever is done must be done promptly, for we must know what we can depend upon so we can make our plans accordingly.  The other states have their buildings already up.  The exposition opens June 1, and we want to be getting our exhibits in readiness."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Packard says further that the exposition would be a great success, because Douglas county had appropriated $100,000 to help it, and with its other resources of revenue it has "money to burn," and will complete all its buildings as originally contemplated, and open on time in grand style.  The architecture of the exposition is as harmonious and of as high a grade, he says, as that of the World's fair, and the famous Court of Honor will be equaled.  "It will be the greatest exposition the country has seen, aside from the World's fair," said Mr. Packard.  "No newspaper man ought to criticise until he has seen the work that is now being done.  I wish every Iowa daily could send a man to report on it.  It is our great opportunity, even better for us than the World's fair, because we have so much better opportunity to make our displays and to get our exhibits to the exposition in good shape, with less to compete against after we get there."</p>

The Westlake Construction company of St. Louis, Mo., was the lowest bidder on the carpenter work and Alexander &amp; Son of Memphis, Tenn., were lowest on the staff work.  The Westlake Construction company proposed to do the carpenter work for $22,900 and Alexander &amp; Son offered the staff for $8,000.  The second staff bid was made by Smith &amp; Eastman, who were about $3,000 higher than the successful bidder.

                            <p>R. W. Richardson, who has been visiting numerous points in Missouri as a special commissioner in the interest of the exposition, has returned home and reports that he met with flattering success.  He had a number of interviews with Governor Stephens at Jefferson City and says that the governor is now at work selecting a commission to take charge of the work of seeing that Missouri is properly represented, both by a state building and an exhibit.  The appointment of this commission has been delayed by the determination of the governor to appoint only men who will act and take hold of the matter at once.  Mr. Richardson says that so far as the commission has been formed, it is composed of very strong men, who will see that the state is properly represented.</p>
                            <p>In St. Louis, Mr. Richardson met with encouraging success.  The merchants and manufacturers of the city have taken hold of the matter with vigor and have organized a St. Louis Exposition, commission.  This commission will visit Omaha about the first week in January and inspect the progress which has been made by the exposition management and look over the grounds with a view to reporting to the people of St. Louis and giving them the proper idea of the magnitude of the undertaking.</p>
                            <p>St. Joseph was also visited by Mr. Richardson and he reports that that city is thoroughly aroused.  President Clayton of the Commercial club will call a meeting early in January to take steps to co-operate with the commission to be appointed by the governor and secure proper representation in the state exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Richardson will return to Missouri after the holidays and complete the work thus favorably started and to attend the meeting in St. Joseph, as well as those to be held at other points.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Move to Gather the Iowa National Guard Here in 1898.</head>
                            <p>Secretary Judson of the Council Bluff's Transmississippi Exposition auxiliary, is beginning under direction of the association a regular campaign in the interest of the mobilization of the Iowa National Guard at Council Bluffs next year.  This work is one of the most important things that the association has undertaken to accomplish.  It is in line with the original intention to do everything possible to assist in the larger enterprise of national mobilization.  Hundreds of letters coming officially from the association have been sent to members of congress in Iowa and adjoining states, and to prominent citizens and politicians, urging them to make use of all their influence to secure national mobilization.  This work has been productive of good results, if the numerous responses containing favorable replies and strong pledges can be taken as any indication.  The association has deemed it wise to make a personal appeal to the citizen soldiery of Iowa, and for this purpose has instructed its secretary to send a letter to the commissioned officers and noncommissioned staff of the Iowa National Guard.  Over 100 of these letters were consigned to the mails yesterday.  The letter is as follows:</p>
                            <p>This association is endeavoring to secure a grand encampment of the entire Iowa National Guard at Council Bluffs in the fall of 1898, during the continuance of the Transmississippi and International Exposition.  It is possible that we may also secure an encampment of a large portion of the national guard of other states as well as a mobilization of the cream of the regular army of the United States during the same period.  In any event it will be a grand opportunity for the improvement of the national guard along these lines, as we have some 1,200 acres of choice camp ground within the city limits and directly on the electric car line connecting this city with the exposition grounds.</p>
                            <p>We hope to have your valued co-operation and that of your command in our endeavor, especially as certain legislation will be necessary in order to consummate this project.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Wattles at a New Trick--"The Laborer" Uncovers Jim Boyd.</head>
                            <p>The average citizen was somewhat surprised when, on reading the proceedings of the city council in the Bee he found that the membership had got a quiet "tip" to remain in the hall after adjournment on Tuesday night, and that a select caucus had been held with the agents of the water works company, who made a proposition through a proposed ordinance to secure the extension steal, which they failed to get last spring.</p>
                            <p>At the end of the Bee report it said no decision had been arrived at, but that the subject would be more fully discussed "at the mass meeting tonight."  This was somewhat startling.  "Mass meeting tonight."  Where?  At what hour?  Of whom?  We searched the Bee for a prominently displayed ad.  It was not there.  It must be in the World-Herald, then, but a search failed to find it.</p>
                            <p>Well, THE WESTERN LABORER made up its mind to find that "mass" meeting&#8212;and we did.</p>
                            <p>At 8 o'clock Wednesday night there gathered a few well known faces in the city hall&#8212;some waterworks strikers, councilmen, prominent citizens and "taxpayers."</p>
                            <p>The electric lights were burning quite dim&#8212;an appropriate setting and accompaniment for the dark and villainous work on hand.</p>
                            <p>After the "mass meeting" had assembled, not over 50 persons in all, President of the Council Bingham called the "meeting" to order and Councilman Burkley was elected chairman.  On taking his seat the chairman stated that the "mass-meeting" was called to give the citizens an opportunity of discussing the proposed water works ordinance and the question was now before the house.  The clerk was then requested to read the following ordinance:</p>
                            <ab>ORDINANCE NO. &#8212;</ab>
                            <p>An ordinance to amend section 14 of Ordinance No. 423, entitled "An ordinance to authorize and procure the construction and maintenance of water works in the city of Omaha, state of Nebraska," and to repeal section 14 of said ordinance No. 423 as heretofore existing.</p>
                            <p>Be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Omaha:</p>
                            <p>Section 1.&#8212;That section 14 of ordinance No 423, entitled "An ordinance to authorize and procure construction and maintenance of water works in the city of Omaha, state of Nebraska," be and the same is hereby amended so as to read as follows:</p>
                            <p>Sec. 14.&#8212;The city of Omaha shall have a right at any time after September 1st, A. D. 1908, to purchase the said water works at an appraised valuation, which shall be ascertained by the estimate of three engineers, one to be selected by the city council, one by the water works company, and these two to select the third; provided, that nothing shall be paid for the <unclear/></p>
                            
                            <pb n="158" xml:id="TMISB03-158"/>
                            
                            <p>Sec. 2.&#8212;That said section 14 of said ordinance No. 423 as heretofore existing, be and the same is hereby repealed.</p>
                            <p>Sec. 3.&#8212;That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>
                            <p>The city at the present time has the right to acquire the water works plant by purchase in 1900 without paying anything for the unexpired franchise of the company.  If the above ordinance becomes a law that right will not mature until after September 1st, 1908, which permit the water company to fleece the small home owner for eight years more, if not longer.  In return for this the water company will agree to furnish the Exposition company (a private corporation) with free water for five months, which amounts to absolutely nothing for the city.  We submit, dear readers, that this is paying too dearly for our whistle.</p>
                            <p>A glance at the faces present revealed the fact that outside the councilmen, exposition directors and water company lawyers and strikers, very few citizens were present.  The "mass meeting" assembled inside the rail in the council chamber.</p>
                            <p>The chair called on the first speaker.  Mr. Wattles, in a long and cunningly framed speech, related the woes of the exposition directory, who have now, at the end of nearly two years, discovered that they must have their water supply from the Omaha water company.  He bewailed the injustice the people had practiced on the benevolent water company, who now proposed to give the exposition free water
                                
                                <!-- Pages switch back and forth from 157 to 158 throughout the article -->
                                <!-- <pb n="157" xml:id="TMISB03-157"/> -->
                            
                            for five months, if the "mass meeting" would only instruct the city council to pass the ordinance giving the water works company an extension of its franchise for five years (actually eight years).</p>
                            <p>Ex-Gov. Boyd had come into the "mass meeting" in his peculiar, calm and quiet way, which few can imitate.  He looked so innocent and disinterested in the job on hand, one would have thought he had just dropped in to see what was going on, but the governor didn't deceive THE WESTERN LABORER.  The fact is that Gov. Boyd was one of the promoters and workers for the scheme.  Coming down town in a street car early in the week he unfolded the plan to Mr. Thomas Kilpatrick in our hearing and said to him, "<hi rend="italic">we</hi> want you there."  Mr. Boyd can now explain what he meant by "we," seeing that he bore such a disinterested exterior in the game of grab and fleece.  Previous to the meeting being called to order Mr. Boyd recognized John D. Howe and sidled up to him wearily, inquiring, "Well, what are you going to do?"  Howe glanced up at him laughingly through the corner of his eye and said, "I don't know.  What are you going to do?"  Mr. Boyd, finding Howe uncommunicative, left him with a sigh and a yawn, remarking, "Well, if they don't soon commence business, I will go home."  Howe knew better.  He knew the governor would stay to the last minute.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kilpatrick followed Mr. Wattles with a very cautious and non-committal speech in favor of the water company's proposition and then the chair called on Mr. Boyd, a citizen and "taxpaper" who arose quite lazily and made an argument in favor of accepting the proposed ordinance.  He said he was in favor of municipal ownership, but doubted whether the city would be in a condition to acquire the water works when the time arrived to exercise the privilege, and all the speakers who followed Boyd on that side of the question turned prophets at once.  This argument had evidently been well masticated.</p>
                            <p>A Judge Macomber was then called.  He said he had come to Omaha from Iowa to get rich.  After seven years of grievous disappointment, he thought that if the people would only give the water works company what they wanted, he could realize his hoped-for opportunity, and the city would lose nothing.</p>
                            <p>Wattles then suggested the name of Z. T. Lindsey to the chair, and that gentleman said he couldn't make a speech without a subscription paper in his hand.  He had worked hard, etc., and they must have water for the exposition, and he thought the council
                            
                                <!-- <pb n="158" xml:id="TMISB03-158"/> -->
                            
                            should accept the propos<unclear/></p>
                            <p>At this point Mr. Kilpatrick stepped over to Wattles and whispered a suggestion, when Wattles arose and delivered himself of this resolution:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That it is the sense of the citizens here present that the city council of Omaha should speedily pass such legislation as will procure for the exposition an <choice><sic>adequade</sic><corr>adequate</corr></choice> supply of water from the Omaha Water Works company free to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>But if the city council can see any authority for betraying the interests of its constituency in the adoption of such a resolution under the circumstances by which it was adopted, they will pass the ordinance at their peril.</p>
                            <p>On the reading of the resolution John D. Howe rose to protest, and denounced the "mass meeting" as unrepresentative of the people of Omaha.  He said it was not advertized; that he only knew of it by accident; that there was nothing represented there but the city officials and two corporations&#8212;the water works company and the exposition company.  He proceeded to argue the question as he did last spring, and roasted Wattles and the water company to a turn, showing that the proposition was a scheme to give the water company really an 8-year extension, (equal to more than $2,000,000) for five months free water for the exposition: the water company to pay the exposition company $20,000 for the piping they have now laid.  He pointed out that it was only a trick to avert and tide over the coming crisis for a few years, and then some other scheme would be contrived to meet the same <choice><sic>emmergency</sic><corr>emergency</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>Wattles replied and denied that it
                            
                                <!-- <pb n="157" xml:id="TMISB03-157"/> -->
                            
                            was a packed meeting.  He said he had notified an hundred taxpayers, including fifty of the exposition directory, but admitted that the meeting was not a meeting of the citizens of Omaha.  It was a stormy night and the people had not come out, not even the directory.  He said he didn't know this man Howe (we venture the statement that Howe <hi rend="italic">knows</hi> Wattles; but he wanted to see the water question for the exposition solved by the passage of the ordinance in the council "and if it was not solved, it is a question whether the exposition gates would open next June."</p>
                            <p>W. S. Poppleton protested against the resolution and declared that the meeting was not representative, he had only heard of it by accident.  He argued against the ordinance, as he did against the same job last spring; said he wanted to help the exposition but would never submit to let the water company club the exposition directory into line and blackmail the city; he expected to live here a long time and was for the exposition in every possible way but was for Omaha first.</p>
                            <p>Dick Hall, who had been called on by the chair but declined, having come there merely out of "curiosity" now interrupted Poppleton with smart sayings, but the speaker reiterated his former statements that it was a scheme to put the breath of life into $11,000,000 of stocks and bonds which are now worthless, and he had the papers and statements of the water company in his pocket which he would read to prove it, if necessary.  He warned the council that the people would not permit the consummation of this job; that they would again go into the courts, if necessary, to prevent it.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Woodbury, president of the water company, with a cross accent between cultchaw and cockneyism told us he had been telegraphed for and had come here in good faith, which we were very glad to hear.  He proceeded to bull-doze the opponents of the water works scheme; said the water company wanted nothing from Omaha but Omaha wanted free water for the exposition, which was quite generous in Omaha, but they were not prepared to give the service with<unclear/> the proposed extension was granted <unclear/> "no extension, no watah."</p>
                            <p>Dick Hall now showed his teeth <unclear/> after his employer, and attacked Poppleton personally, yelping like a terrier dog.  He insinuated that <unclear/> opponents of the scheme had a dar<unclear/> and later purpose to serve by th<unclear/> opposition now.  Mr. Poppleton <unclear/> reply said this was not the first time he had been lied about a<unclear/> denounced the charges of the last speaker as false in every particular.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Benawa modestly arose to throw oil on the troubled waters, and to<unclear/> what a change of heart he had been blessed with since last spring.  His vision was much clearer now than then and he thought the council should pass the ordinance as read.</p>
                            <p>Judge Woolworth now took the floor and told us he had been defending the interests of the water company "for pay."  This was not very startling news, but he proceeded in a long and cunningly constructed argu-<unclear/>
                            
                                <!-- <pb n="158" xml:id="TMISB03-158"/> -->
                            
                            ordinance.</p>
                            <p>John D. Howe then proceeded to flay the "curiosity" masqueraders and said the water company was represented by numerous and talented counsel, and if their clients had not paid them they should pay them well, and he would rather see them come out boldly for their clients than have them masquerade as "curiosity seekers."  At this juncture Bierbower, a water works official and son-in-law of Mr. Boyd, put his arm over the shoulder of another and murmured, "they'll spoil everything," evidently meaning Howe and Poppleton.</p>
                            <p>James M. Kenney now thought it was his turn to talk but he was mistaken in the character of the "mass" meeting.  He addressed the chair and was recognized, but the gang began to lift their overcoats and file outside the rail.  Kenney kept the floor, however, until Wattles talked of the last car and asked a vote on the resolution.  One of the exposition directors asked another one, "Who is that fellow talking?" and the other replied: "Oh, he is only a workingman, let us call for the question."  The question was called for, the chair put it, the gang voting aye standing at the doorway, and the resolution was declared adopted&#8212;and Jim Kenney's speech "died a-bornin'."</p>

                            <l>STATE JOURNAL BUREAU, <lb/> 306 South 12th Street.</l>
                            <p>OMAHA, Jan. 3.&#8212;There is a startling rumor afloat in regard to exposition affairs, to the effect that there is likely soon to be a complete turning over in the exposition official list.  Inquiry today among a number of those prominent in exposition affairs failed to yield confirmation of the report, but the story behind it is decidedly plausible.  It is related that the needs of the association for additional funds with which to carry on the work has become so pressing that some of the leading Omaha capitalists have been appealed to for financial aid in the way of the needed funds, and that they have consented to furnish it upon certain conditions.  One of the conditions is said to be that most of the men now in control shall be relegated to obscurity and new managerial talent substituted.  This story further relates that there has been nearly $500,000 subscribed for stock of the exposition association, of which only about 60 per cent has been collectible, as stockholders have refused to put up while the exposition is under its present management, the antipathy being chiefly entertained against Manager Rosewater of the department of publicity and promotion.  If there is any truth in the story as related, however, Mr. Rosewater is not the only prominent worker who will be retired in case the predicted change is made, as others equally as prominent are slated to go under the promised overturning.</p>
                            <p>The chief element of plausibility in this story is in the more or less well known fact that the exposition management is exerting every possible effort to get money.  For a long time it had two experienced collectors at work trying to get in the money that had been subscribed, and these are the men who ran against the opposition to putting up the money until there have been changes in the management.  The backwardness of some of the subscribers has been partially cured by the fact that others have paid more than their share of the assessments, and some, like the Burlington railway, have paid up in full and donated the amount to the exposition, requiring no stock in return.</p>
                            <p>Most of the gentlemen consulted with reference to this rumor were not inclined to believe that there can be any change advantageously made at this late day, and that therefore none is likely to be made of material consequence, but one of the two of those consulted thought that they could recall a forerunner of such an <choice><sic>unheaval</sic><corr>upheaval</corr></choice> in the action recently taken by the board of directors wherein it decided that on the 15th of January the newspapers of Omaha would be furnished with lists of the subscribers to exposition stock and a statement showing the amount each had subscribed, the assessments levied and the amount that each has paid.  It is urged that there must be something potent in the necessity that would prompt or suggest such a step, especially when it is remembered that this step must be taken against some of the most prominent and influential men in the community.</p>
                            <p>There are a good many people in Omaha who do not believe that it is too late to make any changes in the management of the exposition that would advance the interests of the enterprise.  There are many who have never liked the assumptions of Mr. Rosewater, and his dictatorial methods, and there are others who express the conviction that a new president could be selected who would lend prestige and assurance to the stability of the thing.  Attention is called to the fact that the men now in control are not at all the ones who first took up the exposition work and got the movement on its feet.  The original exposition association was organized in the fall of 1894, just after the trans-Mississippi congress had by resolution, offered by W. J. Bryan, declared in favor of such an exposition and for Omaha as its location.  Some of the members of the first exposition association were in that convention and some of them at least, Hon. Dudley Smith, was a member of the committee that prepared the resolution which Mr. Bryan introduced.</p>
                            <p>Immediately afterward the first exposition association was organized, with an authorized capital stock of $1,000,000, a condition being that it was authorized to do business as soon as a certain small per cent of its authorized capital was subscribed.  At the first meeting more than the required amount was subscribed and a board of eleven directors was selected, among them being J. E. Markell, J. H. Evans, C. S. Montgomery, Dudley Smith, J. A. Wakefield, Charles Metz, W. R. Bennett, G. H. Payne, Mr. Thompson of the firm of Thompson &amp; Belden, G. W. Wattles and one other whose identity is not now recalled.  Mr. Wattles was made president, J. E. Markell vice president and J. A. Wakefield secretary.  Herman Kountze, who was not a member of the directory board, was made treasurer.  Of this number only Messrs. Wattles and Kountze are now active in the management of the exposition affairs.  Mr. Wakefield <choice><sic>s</sic><corr>is</corr></choice> secretary, but has no decisive voice, as is the case also with Mr. Wattles, who is the president of the new association.  Mr. Montgomery is counsel for the exposition association.</p>
                            <p>These prime movers in the exposition enterprise subscribed the sum of $50 each to meet preliminary expenses and went to work to secure the necessary congressional appropriation, and it was not until the Nebraska delegation in congress had secured the appropriation of $200,000 that many of those who are now taking an active part in exposition affairs paid much attention to the project.  Then there ensued a fierce scramble to get into places of responsibility, and in 1896 the present organization was the result of that competition.</p>
                            <p>Some of these prime movers for the trans-Mississippi exposition who were subsequently displaced by the men now in charge do not discuss exposition affairs without manifesting a few sore spots in their memories of the progress of the work, and they at least are inclined to think that it is hardly too late to make some changes advantageously.</p>

                            <p>The people of Cheyenne, Wyo., are becoming aroused to the necessity for having their state represented in the Transmississippi Exposition and meetings are being held to devise ways and means to bring about this result.  The fact that the legislature did not make an appropriation is generally regretted, but the people are now formulating plans for making an exhibit by raising the necessary funds from private subscriptions.  Several plans have been discussed and it is announced that decisive action will be taken very soon.</p>
                            <p>Governor Lee of South Dakota is taking an active part in making provisions for raising money for a state exhibit at the Exposition.  In an interview in a Yankton paper the governor is quoted as saying that it would be necessary to raise more than $15,000 or $20,000 for this purpose and he expresses the opinion that this amount can be readily collected.  He strongly advocates prompt action and promises to do all in his power to further the movement.</p>
                            <p>The Iowa papers are giving strong support to the movement of the Iowa Exposition commission to secure an additional appropriation for a state exhibit.  The state debt is urged by the opponents of another appropriation as an urgent argument against any further expenditure in that direction, but it is urged, on the other hand, that Nebraska's nearest neighbor would suffer by such an exhibit as could be provided with the $10,000 already appropriated.</p>

The plans provide for a wooden framework covered with corrugated iron.  The building is in two sections, one for the engines and dynamos and the other for the boilers.  The latter section is to be 137x59 feet in dimensions, located alongside the railroad track which enters the exposition grounds at the extreme northern end of the bluff tract.  Immediately west of this section will be the engine room, 169x62 feet in size.  The building will be forty feet high at the summit of the roof, the side walls being twenty-six feet in height.  A visitors' gallery will be provided in the middle of the building, between the two sections, where visitors may stand and watch the operations of the plant.  This gallery will be so arranged that visitors must enter it from the outside of the building, and they will be prevented from going upon the floor of either the boiler room or engine room.</p>

                            <p>E. S. Tucker, commercial agent in Kansas for the exposition, reports that he is meeting with flattering success in that state.  He says a scheme has been adopted whereby the counties of the state are undertaking to raise a certain amount of money which is to go into a fund to be used for making a state exhibit.  It is proposed to raise about $25,000 in this way, the amount being apportioned among the counties of the state according to the property valuation.  Mr. Tucker says the counties are taking hold of the matter with <choice><sic>vim</sic><corr>him</corr></choice> and he expects that a considerable amount will be raised in this way.</p>
                            <p>He recommends that the 1,000 feet of space allotted to the state of Kansas by the Department of Exhibits be assigned to the Kansas State university and he suggests that Prof. Dyche of the university be asked to install in this space his extensive collection of mounted animals and Arctic curios, which he says attracted great attention at the World's fair.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Tucker reports that the Kansas Salt company of Hutchinson will make a large exhibit.</p>

This firm had the contract for the staff on the Government building at the Nashville exposition and was the successful bidder among a large number of others who competed for the contract on the Government building at Omaha.  His shop will stand near the south end of the Government building and the staff will be stored under the latter structure as fast as it is turned out of the shop.  Mr. Alexander says he will employ about twenty men at the start and will increase this force as the work progresses.  He will commence work as soon as the workshop is finished, which will be immediately after Christmas.</p>

There were nine bids on the carpenter work and two for the staff work.  The Westlake Construction company of St. Louis, Mo., was the lowest bidder on the carpenter work and Alexander &amp; Son of Memphis, Tenn., were lowest on the staff work.  The Westlake Construction company proposed to do the carpenter work for $22,900 and Alexander &amp; Son offered to do the staff for $8,000.  The second staff bid was made by Smith &amp; Eastman, who were about $3,000 higher than the successful bidder.  The bids on the carpenter work were submitted by local contractors and those from outside points.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall was authorized to enter into contracts with the lowest bidders.</p>

                            <p>Secretary Dearing of the Nebraska commission has sent out 10,000 circulars to the schools of Nebraska and to others interested concerning the educational exhibit to be made by the Nebraska schools.

These are in great demand and callers at the office of the department in the The Bee building are supplied with copies to send to their friends or to display in their places of business.  No charge is made for the pictures and the office force is kept busy supplying callers.  An enterprising storekeeper has taken advantage of the popularity of this picture and has sent in numerous requests to the department for a number of copies.  It has been learned that he has been selling the pictures to his customers at 5 cents each, and it is probable that his supply will be rather limited in the future.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 18.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;On motion of Senator Allen the senate today passed the joint resolution which Representative Mercer succeeded in passing through the house late Friday night, appropriating $10,000 from the general fund of the Omaha Exposition for the completion of the government building, as originally planned, and $2,500 for a life saving station exhibit.</p>
                            <p>This was the result of close investigation on Mercer's part as to the manner in which the government board  has been doing business at former expositions.  Mercer had occasion on Friday to examine the records of the Nashville exposition and found the startling fact that nearly $5,000 had been diverted from the exposition purposes for traveling expenses, subsistence and other incidentals.  But as Nashville had but $130,000, $30,000 of which was devoted to the erection of the government building it is clear to be seen that there has been not one but several colored men in the wood pile, and rather than have the Omaha Exposition curtailed in any way he thought that the appropriation of $150,000 for exposition purposes could be cut to $137,500 if the same practice as at the Nashville exposition was to be in vogue at Omaha.</p>
                            <p>In consequence of the resolution there is the greatest activity among the members of the government board, some of whom feel that the exposition will be greatly handicapped in view of the resolution as passed through the house on Friday night.  Mr. Mercer is continuing his investigations as to the manner in which the government money appropriated for specific purposes, namely expositions has been frittered away.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mercer said: "This joint resolution is in the direction of business methods.  If the Atlanta exposition board could save $12,000 and return it to the treasury; if the Nashville exposition board could save $10,000 and cover that amount into the treasury, and this has been done in both instances, in spite of the fact that almost $50,000 were consumed at Nashville for subsistence, salaries and traveling expenses, and that all the members of the government board were paid their salaries by the government and not out of the exposition fund, it seems quite possible for the board at Omaha to be equally liberal in its subsistence, salary and traveling expense account and make an exhibit much better than the one given at Atlanta and Nashville.  These expositions are not organized for the purpose of turning six months into a continuous Fourth of July celebration, but to benefit the people in the country generally in whose midst such expositions are located.  The resolution also adds $10,000 to the Government building, completes it as originally planned and at the same time gives a life saving service exhibit, which otherwise would not be seen at the exposition.  The exhibits will be removed from Omaha at the close of the exposition, but if a precedent is established the building will remain and become a fixture in Omaha, and it is better to have a $60,000 building than a $50,000 building."</p>
                            <p>W. H. Michael, chairman of the government board, representing the State department, on hearing of the action of the two houses, declared that it would necessitate the board reapportioning funds for different departments.  He seemed to think it would curtail the scope of the government exhibit.  He intimated that the $20,000 set aside as a contingent fund would not be disturbed but that the amounts for the different departments would be reduced instead.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;The exhibit of the United States Fish commission at the Omaha exposition, prepared under the direction of W. C. Rovenel, assistant in charge of the division of fish culture, will be located in the northwest corner of the government building, and will occupy 5,000 square feet of space in the form of a LL.  It will be arranged to show the character of the work performed by each of the divisions of the commission, the method and apparatus employed, and the results attained, and will be classified under three heads&#8212;scientific inquiry, fish culture, and methods and statistics of fisheries.</p>
                            <p>In the section of scientific inquiry will be found models and illustrations of the vessels of the commission, specimens of the nets, dredges and other apparatus for scraping the ocean bottom, apparatus used in assorting and preserving the collections, a model of the sounding machine used in deep sea work, and samples of the various thermometers used in physical observations.</p>
                            <p>The results of the scientific inquiry explorations of the commission appear in the form of charts, <choice><sic>besids</sic><corr>besides</corr></choice> specimens of coral, crabs, star fishes, sea urchins, and various invertebrate animals; also extensive series of oysters, showing the rate of growth on different bottoms, and the method of attachment of the spat and the injuries produced by star fish, drills and other enemies of the oyster.</p>

                            <head type="sub">FLEXIBLE CASTS OF FISHES.</head>
                            <p>Another interesting exhibit to be included in this section consists of 150 flexible casts of fishes painted from the fresh or living specimens in faithful imitation of nature.  Also a series of models of vessels showing the development of the fishing vessel of today from the crude craft first used in this country.  The various phases of fishing life will be shown by photographs.</p>
                            <p>In the fish culture section an effort will be made to show in a practical way the methods followed in hatching eggs of salmonidae.  The fish resulting from the same will be in the aquarium during the exposition.  Supplies will be received from Leadville and other neighboring states.</p>
                            <p>The aquarium will contain about twenty-five tanks, each tank being seven feet long, three feet high, and five feet wide at the top.  An equal number of tanks for salt water and fresh water respectively are arranged on each side of the grotto, with a passage way twelve feet wide dividing them.  The tanks next to the wall are to contain many of the food fishes propagated by the commission, besides a large number of the important food and economic fishes of the Mississippi river and other rivers.  In the other tanks will be shown the most important fishes of the eastern states.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WATER FROM THE SEA.</head>
                            <p>The water for displaying the fishes will be brought from Wood's Hole, Mass., in tank cars, and will be stored in a large reservoir tank beneath the floor.  From this tank it will be forced by means of nickel pumps driven by electricity into a smaller tank eighteen feet above the floor, located in another section of the building not yet decided on.  It will then be introduced by means of gravity from the overhead tank.  From the aquaria tank it will return to the reservoir, first passing through a filter, which removes all extraneous matter.</p>
                            <p>As an aid in keeping this water pure air will be constantly forced into it by means of an air pump operated by hydraulic pressure.  The air is liberated in minute particles at the bottom of the tanks through plugs of bas wood inserted in rubber liberator holders attached to rubber tubing which is connected <choice><sic>wkith</sic><corr>with</corr></choice> a pipe leading from an air pressure tank.  The fresh water will be obtained at the city water works and the overflow from the fresh water aquarium will pass into the lagoon.</p>
                            <p>The interior of the grotto will be finished in adamant and cement, partly in stucco work and partly plastered in imitation of a roughly blasted rock tunnel.  Where the two arms of the LL meet rotundas will be formed, with a pool at the bottom of the rock work in imitation of an entrance to a water cave, which will be <choice><sic>illumniated</sic><corr>illuminated</corr></choice> by electric lights.  Here and there in the grotto mosses will be planted, together with ferns and other greens.  Two arched portals in imitation of cut stone and of simple architectural design, will form the entrance of the grotto.</p>
                            <p>It is the intention of Mr. W. DeC. Ravenal to give Omaha a big fish show, and judging from the plans which he has formulated it will exceed anything that has ever been done heretofore.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Senator Allen's Bill in Congress a Move in the Line Suggested by Experts in the Science.</head>
                            <p>Walter Channing Wyman of Chicago, well known in connection with the anthropological department of the World's fair, and a student of the American Indian who has collected a large number of rare and interesting articles of Indian manufacture, is taking an active interest in the bill recently introduced in congress by Senator W. V. Allen, providing for an appropriation for an Indian exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition.  Mr. Wyman has also been in correspondence with the management of the exposition for some time regarding this matter and has made a number of suggestions as to the general form of such an exhibit, the suggestions being based on his extensive experience and observation of the Indian.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wyman wrote to Senator Allen last week suggesting a plan for an exhibit and sent a copy of the letter to E. Rosewater, who has been working actively to bring about a big Indian exhibit under the direction of the government in connection with the exposition.  In this letter Mr. Wyman suggests that groups from the most picturesque tribes of Indians be camped on the exposition grounds from the most picturesque tribes of Indians be camped on the exposition grounds for a month at a time the groups following one another in such a way as to have one or more tribes on exhibition all the time, living in their characteristic tepees and giving their peculiar dances and other ceremonies.  In addition to these groups Mr. Wyman suggests an extensive collection of accoutrements, implements, utensils, weaving, etc., along with the various specimens of archaeology from the different western states closely associated with Indian history.  He suggests that these articles be exhibited in a block house erected in the center of the camp of Indians, representing the two opposing elements which were foremost in the early frontier days.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wyman lays particular stress upon the factor of time in making such an exhibit.  He says the collection of an exhibit which would be representative and creditable would require extensive journeyings among the distant Indian reservations and the purchasing of desirable specimens from these tribes.  He calls attention to the fact that the archaeological and ethnological exhibit at the World's fair was not ready for exhibition until three months after the fair opened, notwithstanding this feature of the show was one of the first to be provided for.</p>
                            <p>In closing his letter Mr. Wyman says: "The encroachments of civilization are so rapid among the Indians, and the advancing age of the aboriginal chiefs and warriors so marked, it is safe to say this opportunity may be looked upon as the last one for the American people to see the best examples of this race in their wild condition of fantastic dress and interesting ceremonies."</p>

                            <p>John K. Goudy, United States consul general at Paris, France, writes to the Department of Publicity and Promotion from Paris under date of December 7 to the effect that he is using every means in his power to advance the interests of the exposition among the people of France.  He suggests that the United States minister to France be urged to lay the matter before the government officially, but this has probably been done before this time, as the usual round of red tape was started several months ago through the regular official channels.  Mr. Goudy encloses a letter addressed to him by the president of the Paris Chamber of Commerce, acknowledging the receipt of the prospectus of the exposition and promising to lay the matter before the chamber.  The president says the chamber will not fail to take action as soon as the government of France asks it to participate and he expresses a desire to do all in his power to extend the friendly relations between the two countries.</p>

                            <p>The exposition grounds presented an animated appearance yesterday.  Notwithstanding the threatening aspect of the weather during the afternoon, a goodly number of people visited the grounds&#8212;many to enjoy the skating, others to experience the feeling of falling off a house furnished by the toboggan slide and the remainder to inspect the progress made during the week on the buildings and to watch the merrymakers.  The attendance was not so large as on former Sundays, but the crowd was large enough not to look lonesome.</p>
                            <p>While the snow was falling scrapers were kept busily at work clearing the ice and the crowds of skaters were given an opportunity to enjoy the sport to the utmost.</p>
                            <p>Work on most of the buildings progressed as usual and the noise of the hammer added to the gay shouts of the merry crowd.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The trip of the Nebraska delegation to Texas in the interest of the Transmississippi and International Exposition was one of the most successful pilgrimages since the inception of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska party left Omaha Saturday night, December 4.  The delegation was composed of sixty-five men drawn from all portions of the state.  Twenty-five of the party were from Omaha and the others were from Lincoln, Beatrice, Holdrege, Kearney, Tekamah, Fremont, O'Neill, Hastings, Kenesaw, Valentine, Lexington, Beemer, York, West Point, Chadron and Springfield.</p>
                            <p>At Kansas City the party were taken in charge by the management of the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas railway, usually referred to, for brevity's sake, as "the Katy."  George A. McNutt, district passenger agent for this road, with headquarters in Kansas City, took charge of the party and accompanied it until Kansas City was reached on the return trip.  The courtesies extended to the party by this road, through Mr. McNutt, and also through the general passenger of the same road, W. C. Crush, who met the party at Fort Worth and again at Dallas, traveling with it a part of the way, were unlimited.  Time cards were thrown to the winds.  Although the party traveled in two special sleepers attached to the regular trains, stops were made wherever the members of the delegation desired to do missionary work for the exposition by addressing the crowds which congregated at the depot or up town.  These stops were regulated to suit the occasion, without regard to the running time of trains and telegrams were sent ahead to notify the towns that the party was approaching and desired to address the citizens.  Everything, in short, was done by these officials that could conduce in the slightest degree to the success of the mission of the travelers and the amount of benefit inuring to the exposition by the opportunities thus afforded to pour the hot shot into people all along the line is incalculable.</p>
                            <p>At every stop members of the party made a willing detail to distribute advertising matter related to the exposition.  This matter was taken around to the stores and hotels and distributed along the streets and among the crowds gathered at the depots.  None of it was wasted, but a strip of country through Texas was literally plastered with this advertising matter as effectually as could have been done by the advertising car of a well regulated circus.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The first stop of any length was made at Fort Worth, Tex., Monday morning, where the party stopped for an hour and a half.  W. E. Skinner, superintendent of the stock yards, took the party in charge down the line and the entire delegation was escorted to the Worth hotel, where the Nebraskans were the guests of the town.  Mayor Paddock acted as host and greeted the tourists in the most enthusiastic manner.  After breakfast the visitors were escorted  to the court house, a beautiful granite structure, of which the people of Fort Worth are very proud.  Mayor Paddock welcomed the party in a felicitous speech full of witticisms.  General Colby replied on behalf of the Nebraska delegation and then a short time was given to the interchange of greetings.</p>
                            <p>At Waco a large crowd of citizens was at the depot and a short talk was made by L. H. Austin, editor and proprietor of the Lincoln, Neb., Call, who expounded the gospel of the exposition in a convincing manner.  M. B. Davis, editor of the Waco Times-Herald, replied on behalf of the people of Waco, the mayor having been called away.  Mr. Davis said he was authorized to pledge the mayor, the Commercial club and all the other organizations of the city to aid the exposition in every possible way.</p>
                            <p>Numerous short stops were made at other points along the way, at each of which the time was filled to the best advantage in spreading the news of the exposition.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Houston was reached about midnight Monday.  Tuesday morning the party was escorted to the convention hall by a committee of Houston citizens appointed for the purpose.  Lieutenant Governor Jester called the meeting to order and Frank Holland, ex-mayor of Dallas, was elected temporary chairman.  L. L. H. Austin of Lincoln, Neb., was elected secretary.  Judge Norman G. Kittrell of Houston, a prominent citizen and one of the foremost members of the bar, made a formal address of welcome and voiced the enthusiasm and interest of the people of Texas in the exposition project.  Ex-Governor Saunders made a response for the visitors and injected an amount of vim and vigor into his remarks which surprised even those who knew him best.  His talk was a ringing speech which aroused the Texans and served to expedite business.</p>
                            <p>The convention proceeded immediately to business and adopted without a dissenting voice a resolution indorsing the exposition in the most glowing terms and commended it to the people of Texas.  It provided that the vice president for Texas, who was to be appointed
                            
                            <pb n="162" xml:id="TMISB03-162"/>
                            
                            at once by the governor, should appoint a second vice president in each senatorial district in the state, the persons thus appointed to constitute the Texas Exposition commission, with the state vice president for the state at once, in view of the fact that the two heretofore appointed had both resigned.</p>
                            <p>After this resolution had been adopted John H. Reagan, chairman of the State Railway commission and an ex-member of Jeff Davis' cabinet, as well as the idol of all good Texans, addressed the meeting briefly, commending the movement to secure representation for the state at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the advertisement for the exposition afforded by this convention the exposition was represented in the most favorable manner in the float parade which passed through all the important streets of Houston the night of December 8.  One of the handsomest floats in this parade was a large one on which the Arch of States was reproduced.  It attracted attention on every side and was a most attractive display.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Wednesday morning the party started for Sabine Pass and Port Arthur over the lines of the Sabine &amp; East Texas railway, a line operated by the Southern Pacific.  The party was in charge of John B. Goodhue, vice president of this line.  A short stop was made at Beaumont, one of the principal lumber points in the state.  The visitors visited the lumber mills where much of the lumber used in this section is turned out, and returned to the station to talk exposition to the townspeople who had congregated there.  The party was joined at this point by Herman Kountze of Omaha and Charles Kountze of Denver, who are largely interested in Sabine Pass.  They accompanied the party to Sabine Pass, one of the oldest towns in the state, where the company in which the Kountzes are interested is engaged in building slips and making a deep water port.  After the banquet served here speeches were made by both sides and then a schooner was boarded and the party treated to a ride out on the rolling waters of the gulf.  A number of the Nebraskans failed to realize on the delicious repast which they had so recently devoured and the fishes of that section were treated to a banquet which must have excited their wonder.  The water was as gentle as a spring lamb, but the slight roll was too much for some of the party.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <p>After returning to the dock the party boarded two small steam yachts and were taken in charge by a delegation from Port Arthur.  By the time the latter town was reached, however, it was too dark to see anything and the party was driven in carriages to the magnificent hotel, which faces Sabine lake, where a most delicious supper was served.  By this time all of the party had recovered their appetites, but the capacity of the hotel was taxed to accommodate the large number of regular boarders who were taking refuge there from the cold weather of the north, and only a portion of the Nebraskans could be accommodated at one time.  Before the second relief could satisfy its appetite the time had arrived for the special train which was to take the party back to Beaumont to catch the regular train to which their sleepers were attached.  Mayor Graham of Lincoln and two of his party were "lost in the shuffle" and missed the train.  The people of Port Arthur were full of resources, however, and a special was made up in short order and the mayor and his little

                            party were forwarded to Houston, where they rejoined the main party.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The main party returned to Houston and remained there until the following morning, when it left at an early hour for Galveston.  The Oleander City had made the most elaborate preparations for the entertainment of the delegation from the north.  When the approach of the train was made known by the whistle of the locomotive as it left the long bridge all the whistles in town broke loose and the air was filled with the shrill shrieks of big whistles and little whistles.  This warning brought out a large crowd of the business men of Galveston and when the depot was reached the visitors were taken in charge by the delegation of Galvestonians and escorted at once to the wharf, where a small steamer was boarded and the visitors carried along the entire length of the water front and then out into the rolling waters of the gulf, past the life saving station and through the jetties.  The rolling of the boat upset the internal economy of some of the Nebraskans, but no serious results followed.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>When the wharf was reached on the return trip the party boarded street cars and traveled all over town on fast time, visiting the Gartenverein, a luxuriant garden belonging to a private club, where the green foliage and beautiful flowers in full bloom delighted the eyes of the visitors, who had just left a foot of snow behind them.  From here the party went to Woolam's lake, where an old-fashioned oyster roast had been in preparation.  No time was lost in gathering around the long tables and the Galvestonians stood aghast at the unfathomable capacity of the Nebraskans.  Raw oysters were ladled out with a quart dipper and the way they disappeared excited the wonder and amazement of the southerners.  The fried oysters shared the same fate, with no apparent diminution in the demand, and then the hosts tried oysters roasted in the pan.  These were a little rich for the Nebraskans, but they "stayed in the game" with a persistency worthy of a better cause.  By this time the oysters roasted in the shell were ready for consumption and the Galvestonians abandoned all efforts to keep their guests supplied with the prepared article.  They dumped the hot shells on the tables and furnished each man with an oyster knife and a small square of jute bagging, telling them to help themselves.  The task of opening the bivalves was a sticker for the visitors and the rapidity with which the fruit disappeared was quickly reduced.</p>
                            <p>After several bushels of the juicy morsels had been disposed of Mayor Fly rapped for order and made a brief speech, in which he expressed in a most delicate manner the astonishment of his people at the marvelous feats of gastronomy which had just been witnessed, and called Governor Saunders to the front, where the venerable patriarch was presented with a leather medal as the consumer of 986 oysters, the highest number ever disposed of by any visitor to Galveston.  The others were given oyster shells containing the authentic record of their capacity for the moluses, and then Judge Mann made a neat speech, in which he expressed the kindly feeling entertained for the people of <choice><sic>Nbraska</sic><corr>Nebraska</corr></choice> by the citizens of Texas in general and of Galveston in particular, concluding with presenting to Governor Saunders the following deed to a portion of the extensive water front of Galveston:</p>

                            <p>This statement was applauded and the resolutions adopted at Houston were reaffirmed with a great shout.</p>

                            <p>The Nebraskans went at once to the depot and boarded their cars, starting for Dallas without delay.  Dallas was reached just before noon Friday.  A delegation of business men, headed by Mayor Barry and ex-Governor Gibbs met the party at the depot and welcomed them in truly southern style, after which the visitors were escorted to the Oriental hotel, a magnificent hostelry, which would do credit to any metropolitan city.</p>
                            <p>After luncheon a business meeting was held at the Commercial club rooms, presided over by President Zang of the Commercial club.  Governor Gibbs made a short talk full of good points, in which he assured the visitors of the hearty co-operation of the people of Dallas in all matters which were to the mutual interests of both states.</p>
                            <p>General Colby and Editor Austin made eloquent talks regarding the exposition, and ex-Governor B. R. Sherman of Iowa made a short speech, which was a gem and pleased the Texans immensely.  Colonel L. W. Crawford of Dallas voiced the sentiments of the people of that city, promising assistance in the exposition to the full extent of the power of their citizens.</p>
                            <p>Emerson Benedict, on behalf of the Nebraska delegation, took this opportunity to present to General Passenger Agent Crush and District Passenger Agent McNutt, both of the Katy, a handsome silver matchbox as a slight token of the appreciation for the many favors and the courteous treatment extended to the party.</p>
                            <p>The remainder of the afternoon was spent in seeing the sights of Dallas and the homeward trip was commenced Friday night.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <p>The next stop of importance was made at Kansas City.  When 100 miles below the city on the Kaw a delegation from the Commercial club of Kansas City met the delegation in a special car and escorted it to the city.  This special car was liberally supplied with refreshments and the time was passed by pleasant interchange of courtesies between the two delegations.  When Kansas City was reached the entire party was taken in carriages to the Midland, where a grand banquet was served.  The dining room was decorated with the civic colors of Omaha, and the menu cards bore the same bright colors.</p>
                            <p>After the banquet the party proceeded to the Commercial club.  Although the hour was late there was a large crowd of Kansas City business men assembled to meet the Nebraskans and hear the gospel of the exposition.  Governor Saunders, General Colby and Mr. Austin made glowing speeches descriptive of the plan, scope, object and progress of the exposition and the importance of the project to Kansas City and Missouri.</p>
                            <p>The speakers for Kansas City expressed the appreciation of their people for the importance of the exposition to them and strong promises were made regarding the manner in which Kansas City would respond by putting up a handsome building and making a creditable exhibit.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MRS. HORTON OFFERS HER COLLECTION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Representatives of All Races Included in the Exhibit, Together with Degrees from Highest to Lowest in Rank.</head>
                            <p>Mrs. Elizabeth R. Horton of Boston, Mass., the woman who has achieved notoriety on account of her collection of dolls, has offered her collection of dolls to the Woman's Board of Managers for exhibition at the exposition.  The dolls number 300 and they represent every nationality.  They were collected by Mrs. Horton from all parts of the world and are instructive as well as amusing, showing, as they do, the national dress as well as the peculiar characteristics of the nation from which they come.  There are Chinese dolls and Dutch dolls, dolls from the far away regions of the frozen north and dolls from the wilds of torrid Africa.  Some are garbed in the dress of the lower classes of their country and others are arrayed in the gorgeous robes of royalty.  They are of all sizes and conditions, from the rag baby of our grandmothers to the dainty wax creatures which rejoice the hearts of the petted child of fortune of modern times.  It is said, with every appearance of truth, that no such collection was ever gathered before and the historic value of the group is considerable.</p>
                            <p>The owner of this dolls' congress has offered the collection to the Woman's board with the suggestion that it be displayed on the exposition ground and a small admission fee charged, the proceeds to be devoted to some charitable enterprise.  The owner says the collection has only lately been shown in public, the proceeds being always used for the support of some charitable institution maintained for children.  She proposes to make a charge of $300 to cover the cost of packing, transportation, care, etc., of the dolls.</p>
                            <p>Whether the Woman's board can take hold of this matter is the question which will come before the executive committee of the women at the next meeting, but the idea is meeting with great favor in other quarters and it is not unlikely that some of the charitable institutions devoted to children may take the matter up.</p>

                            <p>General C. F. Manderson, general attorney of the B. &amp; M. railway, who acted as trustee in making the subscription of $30,000 to the exposition on behalf of the railway company, has notified President Wattles that the road elects to make this contribution toward the exposition a donation instead of a subscription to the stock of the enterprise.  At the time the contribution was made it was stipulated that the railway company reserved the right to make the amount either a subscription to stock or a donation.  The full amount of this contribution has been paid in full, hence the action of the company in notifying the exposition management that it does not desire a stock certificate.</p>

                            <p>The Colorado Exposition commission is getting ready for active work and has sent out an appeal to the county commissioners of each county asking them to make small appropriations to assist in making a state exhibit.  At a meeting of the state commission held last week a committee on ways and means was appointed, consisting of J. B. Swan of Loveland, M. L. Allison of Grand Junction, H. A. Lee, S. K. Hooper and R. R. Goodell of Denver.  This committee immediately formulated the appeal to the county commissioners and ask them to assist in raising $30,000 for a state exhibit.  In case this method fails the Colorado Exposition association is ready to incorporate at once and begin the work of making a state exhibit which will be a credit to the state.  The people of the state, and especially those of the western slope, are thoroughly aroused to the fact that Colorado has lost much valuable time and that energetic work will have to be done if the state is to be represented in any but a small way.  A friendly rivalry has sprung up between the fruit raisers in the Grand Junction region and those of the Arkansas valley and each is preparing to make an exhibit of resources that will surpass the other.</p>
                            <p>The Colorado commission has recommended to Governor Adams that Edward F. Bishop of Denver be appointed vice president for the state to succeed Henry P. Steele, who recently resigned.</p>

                            <p>Prof. C. R. Richards, who has been in the east for several weeks in the interest of the exposition, negotiating with makers of engines for furnishing motive power for the power plant of the exposition, has submitted a lengthy report to the Department of Buildings and Grounds, showing the progress made in securing desirable offers from manufacturers.  He has also forwarded to the Department of Exhibits a number of applications for space for machinery exhibits.  Among these are applications from the J. A. Fay &amp; Egan company, the Lodge &amp; Shipley company, all of Cincinnati, O., and the Buffalo Forge company of Buffalo, N. Y.  He writes that Colcord &amp; Sanderson of St. Louis are making preparations for a collective exhibit by the numerous founderies and machine companies represented by them.</p>

                            <p>Inventor Sherman, he of the Umbrella, announces that the iron for the foundation and framework of the gigantic umbrella which is to amuse the thousands of visitors to the exposition has been prepared and is ready to ship.  He says the erection of the shaft will be commenced at once and that he will be in Omaha December 27 to personally supervise the work.</p>
                            <p>The workmen on the exposition ground put in the early hours of the morning in shoveling the snow from the roofs of those buildings which have not been entirely enclosed.  The construction progressed in a satisfactory manner on all the buildings, the temperature being agreeable and the snow interfering but slightly with building operations except in cases where the workmen were employed on the roofs.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner J. P. Hymer writes to the Department of Exhibits that the people of South Dakota are talking very strongly of an extra session of the legislature to make an appropriation for a state exhibit.  The people of the Black Hills region feel especially sore as a bond proposition for $3,000 was carried, but the county commissioners refused to canvass the vote on account of some legal technicality.  The practical failure to accomplish anything in the way of a state exhibit by private enterprise has started a movement for an extra session, but it is stated that the governor is opposed to the idea and refuses to issue a call.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SOUVENIR TO BE STAMPED BY GOVERNMENT</head>
                            <head type="sub">Design Prepared for a Memento that Will Commemorate the Great Transmississippi Show.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The management of the Transmississippi Exposition has determined upon the design for a souvenir medal to be issued in commemoration of the great exposition of the resources of the states lying west of the Father of Waters, and steps are now being taken to produce a medal which will be unique and characteristic of this region.  These medals will be stamped at one of the government mints and will be made in gold, silver and bronze.  The design for the medals will be supplied by the exposition, and the selection of the most appropriate subject has formed the object of a great deal of discussion and consideration on the part of the Ways and Means department and the members of the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>A conclusion has finally been reached and the medals will be made after designs which will make them most desirable mementoes.  The reverse side will bear in bas-relief a spirited group showing a typical American Indian mounted on a pony and in the act of spearing a buffalo.  This will form a scene suggestive of the conditions existing in this section before the encroachments of the white man drove both Indian and buffalo into the mountains and finally accomplished their almost complete extinction.  Above this design will appear the inscription "Transmississippi," and below will be the date "1848," being the date, half a century ago, when the Indian hunted the buffalo undisturbed.</p>
                            <p>The obverse of the medal, however, will be one of its most interesting features.  The most prominent object on this face will be a profile of a woman's head in bas-relief.  Above it will be inscribed the word "Souvenir," and below will appear the inscription "Omaha, 1898."</p>

                            <p>The manner in which the drawing for the woman's head will be obtained will be a most interesting proceeding.  It is the intention to make this head a characteristic type of the women of the transmississippi region.  In order to accomplish this a composite picture will be made of the forty-eight most beautiful women in the transmississippi region.  Two women from each of the states and territories in this great region will be selected and from their photographs the composite picture will be made by George A. Rockwood of New York, the inventor of composite photography.  The very suggestion of this effort to depict the combined beauty of the women of the great west makes the thankless task of Paris to decide between the ancient beauties dwindle into insignificance.  Each vice president will be asked to select the two most beautiful young women in his state and send to Chairman Lindsey of the Ways and Means department a photograph showing a profile view of the head and shoulders of each, the photograph to be cabinet size.</p>
                            <p>Letters to this effect have been sent to the vice president of each state with the request that prompt action be taken and the photographs sent at once.  The choice of Nebraska beauties will be left to Judge William Neville of North Platte, the vice president for Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>In order to make the task for the vice presidents as easy as possible and avoid serious complications, Manager Lindsey suggests to the vice presidents that the selection of the most beautiful women be made by means of voting contests through the newspapers.</p>

                            <p>In accordance with the resolution adopted at the last meeting of the Board of Directors of the exposition, declaring the absolute necessity of immediately collecting the assessments on stock which have been levied, but not paid, the Department of Ways and Means is beginning a vigorous campaign to collect the large amount of money outstanding.  Letters are now being sent to all subscribers, urging them to pay at once or name an early date when they will do so.  The full text of this letter follows:</p>
                            <p>The time has arrived for each citizen of Omaha to demonstrate his loyalty to the city, and his desire to aid the exposition by prompt payment of his subscription.</p>
                            <p>Construction contrates now in force and nearing completion require further expenditures of more than $200,000 within the next sixty days, and very large payments must be made prior to January 1, 1898.</p>
                            <p>"The management based all calculations on subscriptions placed in their hands, and reasonably expect every subscriber or donor, may the amount be large or small, to pay up as fast as assessments are called.  The eyes of the people of not only the United States, but of many foreign countries are watching the progress of this great exposition.  To make it the success contemplated your money is needed.</p>
                            <p>"Each and every director and manager is giving his time, valuable as it may be to him, without one dollar of compensation.  Economy is practiced as much as possible in every department, but the project is a gigantic one, and there must be great outlay before there can be any returns.  It is believed the stock subscribers will get some of their money back, but no such promise is made by the management.  All that is promised is that people who have money to invest will be attracted to the Transmississippi states, and Omaha, South Omaha and Council Bluffs will reap their share of the westward movement.</p>
                            <p>Please send you check or money at once for what is due <choice><sic>fro myou</sic><corr>from you</corr></choice>, to John A. Wakefield, secretary.  <choice><sic>I f</sic><corr>If</corr></choice> you cannot pay now, please name the earliest date when you will pay.</p>
                            <p>This move will be followed by others and more vigorous ones until the desired result is accomplished.  If it becomes necessary suits will be instituted to recover the amount of the unpaid subscription.  Estimates for the construction of the exposition buildings now under contract will be due and payable the first of next month and heroic measures will be resorted to, if necessary, in order to raise the money.</p>

A telegram received yesterday morning by Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion from Major T. F. Bickford, special commissioner for the department in the east, conveys the information that Governor Black has taken hold of the matter in a vigorous manner and announces that he will appoint an active state commission at once.

                            creditable exhibit, but the best manner of procedure to raise the necessary funds is forming the subject of discussion.  The Cheyenne Sun-Leader insists that the time is too short in which to raise the funds by the ordinary methods of private contribution, and that this method is inequitable, and it suggests that some of the moneyed men of the state advance the necessary money with the understanding that it be refunded by the legislature at its next session.  The paper says the sentiment in favor of an exhibit is so strong that the legislature would unquestionably refund the money and the state thus be saved the odium of not being represented in a manner befitting its extensive interests and resources.</p>

                            <head type="sub">J. H. Dumont Chairman and Mrs. Draper Smith Secretary.</head>
                            <p>Yesterday afternoon was held the first meeting of the joint committee appointed by the Commercial club, the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben, the Woman's club and the Exposition directory, which is to have in charge the providing of lodging and entertainment for convention delegates and other visitors next year, the securing of halls for the conventions, and other similar matters.  The committee is proposed to be a sort of bureau of entertainment, comfort and information.</p>
                            <p>The committee organized by the election of J. H. Dumont of the Commercial club as president and Mrs. Draper Smith of the Woman's club as secretary.  The remainder of the meeting was devoted to a discussion and explanation of the proposed objects and plans of the body.</p>
                            <p>It was the general impression that the committee could not assume the burden of seeing that entertainment and lodging and accommodations of other character were provided visitors.  The suggestion was rather made that the exposition directory should create a sort of bureau of comfort, placing some responsible man at the head.  The joint committee made up of representatives of the four bodies now in it and of other business organizations, should have a directory control of this bureau.  According to this plan the committee would see that the necessary money was secured and that proper hotel and lodging accommodations were erected, while the bureau would see to it that necessary information regarding accommodations, conventions, lodgings and other matters should be gathered and dispensed, and should directly look after visitors.</p>
                            <p>Finally, upon motion of Mrs. Strawn, a committee, consisting of Mrs. Draper Smith, C. M. Wilhelm and John E. Utt, was appointed to formulate a plan and present it to the committee at a meeting on January 3.  This plan will also go to the various bodies for approval.</p>

                            <p>The suggestion, made more in joke than in sober seriousness, that one feature of the exhibit to be made at the Transmississippi Exposition by the state of Kansas be a ton of canceled farm mortgages, has been taken up by the newspapers all over the country, and it seems more than likely that such an exhibit will actually be made.  Papers all over the country have commended the scheme as the most effective advertisement the state could have to demonstrate to the world that prosperity has actually arrived in the Sunflower state and that with "dollar wheat" and good crops the Kansas farmer is the most prosperous individual in the country.  The plan contemplates the gathering up, through the offices of the recorders of deeds in the several counties in the state, of all the mortgages which may be paid off during the six months ending some time early in the spring and sending them to Omaha to be arranged as an exhibit.  It is estimated that enough of these souvenirs would thus be collected to fill a freight car and would make a most unique and striking exhibit, giving the lie to the calamity howlers.</p>

                            <p>The committee meeting, which was called at the city hall this morning to consider Stuht's resolution relative to the water works matter, was postponed until afternoon on account of the absence of Stuht.  Chairman Burmester says he will have the committee together every day this week if necessary in order to give Stuht's plan the fullest possible investigation.  Stuht says that he has a proposition in his pocket to pump the water to the exposition grounds from Cut Off lake at an expense of $15,000.  The parties interested are those who made a proposition to the exposition people through Geraldine when the subject was first brought up.  At that time the owners of the water front on Cut Off lake emphatically refused to allow the water to be taken and the plan was dropped.</p>

                            <p>A water color drawing of the Afro-American village which is to form one of the principal attractions on the Midway of the exposition has been received by George B. Haynes, one of the members of the company which has the concession for this attraction.</p>
                            <p>The Afro-American village will be located on the bluff tract near the north end.  It will be opposite the Street of Cairo and its main front will face the west along the broad avenue running from the Grand Plaza to the viaduct leading to the north tract.  The ground occupied by this village will be divided into two parts by a line running east and west about in the center.  The north section will illustrate the condition of the negro in ante-bellum days, and the southern section will illustrate the progress made by the race since the extinction of slavery.</p>
                            <p>The north section will comprise a typical southern plantation.  There will be a cotton field with the plants in full growth and the pickers pulling the fleecy balls from the pods and placing it in the bags hung from the shoulders, afterward emptying it into the storehouse, where it is put through the gin and baled for market.  The little log cabins constituting "the quarters" will be shown in the most realistic manner, true to life in every detail.   The old-fashioned chimneys built of sticks and clay will add to the picturesqueness of the cabins, which will be grouped about the sides of the enclosure.  In the center will be the house where "the voodoo doctor" will dispense his mysterious charms, guaranteed to bring good luck and keep off all evil spirits.  A central pavilion will afford an opportunity for the "bucks and wenches" to show their accomplishments in the way of dancing; the buck and wing dance, the hoe down, cake walk and various other terpischorean novelties to these people will be in full blast at all times.</p>
                            <p>The southern section of the village will be devoted to buildings in which will be shown the advancement made by the race in the quarter century since the shackles of slavery were removed.  A restaurant will form one of the attractions, where visitors may procure fine examples of delicious southern cooking.  A handsome structure will be devoted to a minstrel show, where the most prominent colored minstrels will give a continuous performance.  A more imposing structure will be devoted to the drama and opera.  In the latter will appear some of the most noted singers in the world as well as the foremost actors.  Other structures will be occupied by exhibits illustrating the mechanical ability and ingenuity of the colored race.  All of these last named buildings will be constructed of staff in attractive designs and will form a desirable addition to the architecture of the Midway.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Groups for Decorating the Machinery and Electricity Building.</head>
                            <p>The designing of the statuary which is to ornament the exposition buildings in the main court is gradually assuming form and during the months intervening before the opening of the exposition sculptors in various parts of the country will be engaged in molding the large figures which will add the finishing touches to the magnificent buildings.</p>
                            <p>T. R. Kimball of the firm of Walker &amp; Kimball, architects-in-chief of the exposition, spent yesterday in Chicago in consultation with Dwight H. Perkins, architect of the Machinery and Electricity building, regarding the statuary for that building.  Mr. Perkins had already prepared small models of the groups which he proposes to install on the building designed by him.  These groups were made by Sculptor R. W. Bock of Chicago after designs made by Mr. Perkins.  There are five principal groups in the lot, the main group being over the large square mass which forms the central entrance and the others being placed on the four corner pavilions of the building.  The following descriptions of these groups were prepared by Mr. Perkins:</p>
                            <p>The southwest and northeast groups are identical.  They represent the primitive struggle of man with untamed brute force.  The group shows a lion attacking two men.  The men are barely maintaining life and are bringing to their assistance such brain power is shown dead.  The group is full of force and vigor.  The entire group is about twelve feet high, the figures being about ten feet.</p>
                            <p>The southeast and northwest corners are also duplicates.  They represent the intermediate stage, where man, endowed with intelligence, conquers brute force (symbolized as in the first group by the lion), assisted by the hound.  The brute is, however, simply subjected.  The man is able to protect his dependent family.  The latter makes an architectural composition in conformity and contrast at the same time with the first group.  It conforms in contour and in mass; it contrasts in idea and development.  The hound co-operating with the man symbolizes the dawn of organization.</p>
                            <p>Evolving from this, and crowning the center of the building, rises the principal group.  Here man, in later and more matured development, possessing intelligence and wisdom, takes the same lion, symbolizing force, which in the first stage devours, in the second simply allows to let live and in this, the third, makes the lion do his bidding.  While they are active, they are still in service.  At the sides of the gigantic driver are two figures carrying standards, symbolic of machinery and electricity.  The triumpher is in the vigorous Norse type and carries the magic hammer of Siegfried, by which the mechanical wonders of the age are produced.  The group is twenty-four feet across the front, is twenty feet from front to rear and is sixteen feet high, the middle figure being twelve feet high.</p>
                            <p>On the four intermediate pedestals are placed eagles, designed to symbolize the ethereal quality of electricity and to assist in the architectural composition as well as to suggest the central group below which they are placed.</p>
                            <p>S. S. Beman, architect of the Manufacturers building, is having models made of his designs for the statuary which is to decorate the upper portions of the building designed by him, and these will be submitted for approval as soon as completed.</p>
                            <p>The other architects are likewise working on their designs for statuary, the idea, in each case, being to bring out, by this means, the design and purpose of the building.</p>
                            <p>Propositions have been received for making the statuary for the Administration building.  The designs for this work were made some time ago by the architects-in-chief and the models have been prepared.</p>
                            <p>The time in which these large figures must be made is getting short and energetic action must be taken very soon in order to give the sculptors time to complete the work.  All of the statuary will be made in staff.</p>

                            <p>LINCOLN, Dec. 21.&#8212;My Dear Governor: I am requested by the president of the Transmississippi and International Exposition association to forward you herewith a lithograph cut of a proposed Arch of States to be placed over the main entrance to the exposition grounds at Omaha.  The exposition management and those interested in the matter are desirous of erecting a handsome arch to represent the various states and territories of the transmississippi country, to be composed of twenty-four courses of stone.  On the face of the arch it is proposed to have chiseled prominently and artistically the seals or coats of arms of the different states or territories.  The projectors desire to have each state provide stone sufficient to build one course of the proposed arch from its best quality of building stone.</p>
                            <p>It will be highly appreciated by the exposition management, as well as myself, if you will give your encouragement and assistance to the project.  If the plan meets with your approval you are respectfully requested to have forwarded at the earliest convenience a few samples of the best building stone in your state to Messrs. Walker &amp; Kimball at Omaha, the architects-in-chief of the exposition.  On receipt of these samples the architects will devise the plan of combining the different stone in the structure and advise you what kind of stone should be shipped for the part of the arch representing your state or territory.</p>
                            <p>Thanking you in advance, in behalf of the exposition management, for you kind attention to this matter, I am, yours very truly,</p>

H. Aldrich, the president, presided, took steps looking to providing an exhibit of Alabama's resources at the Transmississippi Exposition to be held in Omaha, Neb., next year.  It was reported by the secretary that Governor Johnston had advised him that the state had no available funds for such an exhibit.  The association then adopted a resolution to the effect that Alabama's resources should be properly represented at Omaha and that the association use its efforts to that end.  The plan, it is understood, is for the various coal, iron and manufacturing companies to co-operate in arranging a suitable display, special attention to be given to the mineral feature.  The exhibit will be got up under the auspices of the association at the expense of the exhibitors.</p>

The cost of clearing away the snow is beginning to be an important factor with the contractors who have not completed the roofs of their buildings.  With a snowfall of from one to three inches during nearly every twenty-four hours within the last ten days every piece of timber and the floors of the buildings have been covered to a depth of several inches.  It has been necessary to clear away the snow form the floors so that the workmen could get around and that on the roofs has been swept off to prevent the men from slipping.  The work has cost these contractors from $10 to $25 per day in addition to the loss occasioned by the delay to the work of construction.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding this obstruction and the delays caused by the low temperature which has made outside work almost impossible in the early hours of the day very satisfactory progress has been made on all of the buildings.</p>
                            <p>The staff men&#8212;those employed in nailing the casts on the buildings&#8212;have set an example which few of the carpenters seem fit to follow.  These men have worked from early morning until late at night putting up the plaster casts which form the ornamental portions of the outside decoration of the Machinery, Electricity and Mines building.  This work is practically the same as carpenter work, the heavy pieces being nailed up like so many boards, the joints mitred and fitted in the same way that finishing lumber is put on a building.  With the temperature 10 degrees below zero these men have stood on the scaffolds erected along the sides of the buildings and nailed the staff in place with about the same speed as in the warmer weather of the fall.  The result is that the staff work is rapidly approaching completion on these two buildings.  The workmen are now engaged in putting the ornamentation in and around the windows of the clear story of the Machinery and Electricity building.  The cornice along the front of this building is almost completed and the effect produced by the placing of the clear story decoration conveys a good idea of the beauty of the completed building.</p>

                            <p>On the Mines building the staff men have made good progress at the west end and the southwest corner.  The cornice and a part of the decoration of this corner pavilion are well advanced and a slight hint at the impressive beauty of this magnificent building may be gathered from the decoration.</p>
                            <p>The carpenter work on the Machinery and Electricity building is progressing, the roof being nearly completed.  The skylights remain to be covered and the workmen are now engaged on the corner pavilions.  There is a great deal of detail work about both the exterior and the interior of this building and considerable time is required to finish up these portions.</p>
                            <p>The carpenter work on the Agriculture building is well advanced.  As many men as can work to advantage are engaged on the corner pavilions, which are elaborate in their details, and others are employed in putting in the windows.  A few skylights remain to be covered with the translucent fabric and when this is finished the building will be entirely covered.</p>
                            <p>The Mines building looks like a huge factory.  The staff shop in which the stucco is cast occupies the middle of the floor of this building and the white casts are pulled all around under the galleries.  The carpenters are engaged in putting in the windows and stairways and finishing the railing about the edge of the galleries.</p>
                            <p>The Liberal Arts building is making good progress.  The roof is completed over the middle of the building, including the skylight, and all that remains to be done to put the entire building under cover is to complete small places about the sides and cover a few side skylights.</p>

                            <p>The Art building is well under way after a long series of delays caused by failure to receive lumber.  The sills are nearly all in place and the floor joists have been laid on the east section of the twin building.  All of the lumber is on the ground and Superintendent Barwick is increasing his force daily, working as many men as can be handled to advantage.</p>
                            <p>The Government building is progressing with a small force of men, about half of them being negroes brought here from the south by the firm having the contract for this building.  These latter handle the heavy timber used in the construction and in doing this the foreman of the gang sings his orders in the style familiar along the wharves of southern Mississippi river ports.  The posts for the side walls of the south wing of this building are in place and those for the main, central portion are being raised.  The pile driver has nearly finished his work and the sills are being placed for the north wing.</p>
                            <p>The Auditorium building is making good progress.  Contractor Creedon has been at his post in all kinds of weather, and a portion of his men have not allowed the severity of the weather to interfere with their work.  The floor of the lower portion of the building and in the gallery has been laid, and the roof is being put on around the sides of the building.</p>
                            <p>Little is being done on the Nebraska building on account of the weather.  The work has reached a stage where little can be done by the carpenters, and the roof can not be put on during cold weather.  The staff contractor is not ready to proceed. Secretary Dearing having gone to Lincoln yesterday to close up the contract with the successful bidder for the staff and plaster work.</p>

                            <p>The skylights which are being put on the main exposition buildings are exciting the curiosity of visitors to the grounds on account of their unusual and attractive appearance.  Over the large openings in the roofs designed to admit light to the <choice><sic>uper</sic><corr>upper</corr></choice> parts of the buildings, and especially to the galleries, is stretched an amber colored material which has the pliability and toughness of fiber paper and the translucent quality of stained glass.  It admits a soft, yellow light which is agreeable to the eye and adds greatly to the penetrating power of the light rays.  No expensive frame is required, but the edges are simply fastened down and covered to make them water tight.  The material is what is known as translucent fabric and is the product of a <choice><sic>Masachusetts</sic><corr>Massachusetts</corr></choice> factory.  It is made by some patented process and its exact composition is a trade secret.  It has the appearance of gelatine, with a fine meshed brass wire screen which forms the framework upon which the composition is spread, and at the same time gives strength to the material.  The advantage of this material over glass lies in the fact that any settling of the building which would cause glass to break and fall <choice><sic>wil</sic><corr>will</corr></choice> not affect this material in the least, as it is very flexible.  For the same reason a hail storm would not cause the damage that would result to glass skylights.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Meeting Called for Tomorrow Afternoon to Consider the Construction of Cheaper Structures Than at First Proposed.</head>
                            <p>The park commissioners has decided to again take up the question of the construction of the bridges across the exposition lagoon.  President Tukey has called a special meeting at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon for that purpose.  The plan as now contemplated is to entirely drop the expensive plans submitted by the exposition architects and begin on a new basis.  It is believed that while the previous plans were highly artistic, they were unnecessarily heavy and extravagant.  In fact each of the bridge companies that submitted propositions stated that the plans as proposed called for ridiculously heavy structures and that if the strains were calculated from an engineering standpoint it would be found that the bridges could be built at a great reduction in cost.</p>
                            <p>Since then the members of the board have been looking up the matter and they are convinced that the bridges can be built for less than $10,000.  They propose to advertise for specifications and bids at once, each bidder to submit the specifications on which his bid is based.  These must all follow a specified general outline which has been prepared by the engineering department of the city.  This is practically Cooper's plans, which are accepted as standard bridge plans, but each bidder will be left free to work out the details according to his own practice.  It is believed that by this means materially better figures can be secured.  The board will then let the contract on what appears to be the best bid, taking both <choice><sic>specifictaions</sic><corr>specifications</corr></choice> and price into consideration, and it is expected that active work on the bridges will be in progress sometime next month.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 21.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Senator Allen today addressed the following letter to all members of the upper branch of congress in relation to his bill asking an appropriation of $50,000 for a congress of Indian tribes at the Omaha exposition next year:</p>
                            <p>"My Dear Senator: I take the liberty of calling your attention to the bill introduced by me (S. 2,508) to provide for the holding of a congress of the Indian tribes of the United States at the city of Omaha, in the state of Nebraska, in the year, A. D. 1898, and for other purposes.  You will greatly oblige me if you will read the bill and the report accompanying it, and if you can, consistently with your sense of public duty, do so, I would be pleased to have you support the measure.  I beg to suggest, if the bill should become a law, this will be the first and probably the last general exhibition of the savage tribes of America, and will be a source of great interest to many people who have never had an opportunity of observing our Indian tribes, their habits and customs.  No doubt the educational features will be of great advantage to thousands.  Omaha is geographically well situated to hold such a congress at a minimum expense to the government.  I believe the money will be well expended in authorizing this congress."</p>
                            <p>The auditor for the Treasury department, William E. Andrews, today approved the requisition for the issuance of a warrant to George A. Bartlett, disbursing agent of the Treasury department, for $25,000, to be used in construction of the government building at the Transmississippi Exposition.  This is the first money to be drawn on behalf of the government board and is understood to be for preliminary work in conjunction with pushing the building to an early completion.</p>

                            <head type="sub">LOCAL MEN SAY THEY ARE SHUT OUT</head>
                            <head type="sub">Were Figuring on Getting Lots of Work, but Find They Are in a Good Way to Get None at All.</head>
                            <p>The dealers and firms in this city who handle electrical appliances and work connected therewith are rising in arms against the exposition directory on the grounds that the latter has effectually debarred them from securing any of the work of wiring or fitting up the exposition grounds or buildings with electric lights.</p>
                            <p>There is a goodly lot of work to be done on the grounds in an electric light way, since it is estimated that some 700 arc lights and 14,000 incandescent lights will be put in.  As a consequence the electricians figured on making some money in supplying the necessary material and appliances and by putting them in place.</p>
                            <p>The first blow came when the exposition directory commenced to figure on the wiring that was used at the Nashville and other expositions, on the grounds of economy.  The electricians, however, did not protest against this, if by this plan the exposition people could secure the necessary material cheaper than if they bought it new.  They still figured that they would secure benefit by putting the wiring in.</p>
                            <p>It has been discovered, however, that by one of the rules of the directory this will be impossible.  This rule provides that all the wiring and work of installing the electric light system shall be done by the exposition company at a fixed price.  This rule is being assailed with vigor.  In the first place it is contended that it is unjust to the local dealers and to the exhibitors both.  The former are knocked out of business they expected and the latter are compelled to pay a higher price for the work than if local companies were allowed to compete for the business.</p>
                            <p>A meeting of representatives of all the local dealers was held at the Commercial club yesterday afternoon.  After talking over the situation a committee, consisting of G. W. Johnston, B. McInnerney and A. Thurby, was appointed to see Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds.  The committee and Mr. Kirkendall met later in the afternoon, but no conclusion was reached.  Mr. Kirkendall said that he was not aware that such a rule was in existence and could promise no relief.  The electrical men will meet again this afternoon in the Commercial club for the purpose of passing a resolution asking the exposition directory</p>

                            <p>The decision of Postmaster General Gary to order a series of special issues of postage stamps commemorative of the holding of the Transmississippi and International Exposition is a matter of highest importance.  It is a mark of distinction and favor at the hands of the government which must prove of immense benefit to the enterprise.  When it is borne in mind that within the 120 years of national life the government has made but two such issues of commemorative stamps, the true significance of General Gary's order can best be appreciated.  The issue will be, not merely that of a postage stamp to be sold at the Omaha postoffice, but it can and doubtless will be placed on sale at every one of the 70,000 postoffices in the United States.  What this widespread circulation would mean to the exposition will be readily perceived by those who recall the popularity of the Columbian stamp, which did so much to attract public attention to the World's fair.  The issue will be not only valuable as a medium of advertising the exposition of 1898, but it gives to the project the prestige of government recognition and support.  The stamps will be issued in denominations of 1-cent, 2-cent, 5-cent, 10-cent, and $1, making it possible for the people of this country to use these stamps on all outgoing foreign as well as domestic mail matter and packets of merchandise.  With the possibilities suggested for the widespread issue of these stamps, certainly every postmaster in the transmississippi region will not fail to make requisition for them.  They will be in most active demand from the start, not only by stamp collectors, but by the hundreds of thousands of people of the west who will take advantage of this means of popularizing the Transmississippi Exposition throughout the west.</p>
                            <p>This issue of commemorative postage stamps will do more to raise the Transmississippi Exposition to the high plane of a national and international enterprise than any other act of the government.  Postmaster General Gary has earned the lasting gratitude of every friend of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>The Department of Publicity is now negotiating with W. H. Green, who managed the excursion to Texas, to take charge of another poetry which will make a tour of the southern and southeastern states for the purpose of arousing the enthusiasm of the people of those sections and inducing them to take an active part in the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The plan for this venture, as at present contemplated, is on a more elaborate scale than the trip to Texas.  It is proposed to have a special train, consisting of a baggage car, a dining car and two sleepers.  The train will run on special time, allowing stops to be made wherever desirable, and the diner will obviate the necessity of stopping for meals.  The baggage car will be stocked with advertising matter and extra baggage of the party.</p>
                            <p>The itinerary now contemplated is about as follows: Starting from Omaha, St. Louis will be the first important stop and public meetings would be held, addressed by able speakers accompanying the party.  Continuing south, short stops will be made at the smaller towns and advertising matter thoroughly distributed all along the line.  The next important stop will be at Memphis, then to Little Rock and from there to New Orleans.  From here the route would include Mobile, Birmingham, Jacksonville, Savannah, Augusta, Atlanta, Chattanooga, Louisville, Cincinnati, Dayton, Columbus, O., Indianapolis, Terre Haute, Bloomington, Springfield, Ill., Keokuk, Davenport, Des Moines, Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The trip will occupy about two weeks or a little longer.  Manager Rosewater and Mr. Green are working out the details of the trip and preparations will be completed as rapidly as possible.  It will not be practicable to organize such a trip before some time early in January.  The arrangement of the details will be largely in the hands of Mr. Green.</p>

E. Thurman for placing on the road an advertising car which will distribute advertising matter in profusion.  Mr. Thurman proposes to have a car elaborately decorated with large pictures, 8x10 feet, on each side of the car, showing the birdseye view of the exposition and the main buildings.  This car will be filled with pictures and printed matter descriptive of the exposition.  Commencing about February 1, Mr. Thurman will have this car hauled over all the railroads within 500 miles of Omaha, making frequent stops, at which the men employed for the purpose will thoroughly distribute the printed matter.  By this means the country surrounding Omaha will be thoroughly covered with exposition literature, millions of pieces being disposed of in this way.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Explains Something of the Nature of the Controversy and the Predicament the Executive Board is In.</head>
                            <p>"The public doesn't seem to understand the position of the exposition executive committee on this water question," remarked Manager Babcock of the Transportation department.  "The committee doesn't ask that the franchise of the water company be extended five years or any other time.  It simply appears before the city council to state that the exposition must have water in order to be a success, and the council is asked to take whatever action it may deem best to bring about this result.  The committee doesn't care how this is accomplished or what arrangement is made between the city and the water company to bring it about.  No terms of settlement of compromise are suggested by the committee.</p>
                            <p>"It may appear rather remarkable, on the face of it," continued Mr. Babcock, "that this important matter was not settled by the exposition management before the plans for the exposition had reached an advanced stage, but the fact is that negotiations have been pending with the water company since the beginning of the exposition work.  We have been given to understand all along that some way would be found to supply the necessary water whenever a satisfactory arrangement should be made with the city authorities.  At one time the committee seriously considered the idea of pumping water into the lagoon from Cut Off lake, keeping the lake full by pumping water into it at the further end from the river.  The property owners along the lake objected and threatened to enjoin us and there the matter was dropped.  I still believe that this scheme is feasible and that the lake can be kept full by means of a pipe line laid along the river bank to a point where a sufficient grade can be secured to allow the water to run into the lake by force of gravity, thus saving the expense of pumping into the lake.  A plant for pumping the water from the lake to the lagoon in the main court could be installed and operated for a small amount.</p>
                            <p>"The serious phrase of the matter, however," said Mr. Babcock, "lied in the fact that the water company now says that it cannot supply the exposition with water for domestic purposes, drinking, fire protection, etc., to say nothing of keeping the lagoon filled.  The water from Cut Off lake would not be suitable for these purposes, and we are absolutely dependent upon the water company in this matter.</p>
                            <p>"What the exposition management asks is that the company furnish the necessary water on the best terms that can be obtained, either for nothing or at the expense of the exposition."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Centennial State Proposes to Afford a Luscious Feast.</head>
                            <p>G. W. Swink of Rocky Ford, Colo., has been in the city for a few days completing arrangements for a "watermelon day" during the great fruit festival which will form an attractive feature of the exposition during the whole summer.  Out where Mr. Swink lives the watermelon carnival has come to be as important an event each year as the apple carnival, which has given Glenwood, Ia., and Grand Junction, Colo., wide repute as fruit districts.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Swink claims to be the <choice><sic>originateor</sic><corr>originator</corr></choice> of the watermelon festival.  He says that the first one was given nineteen years ago and considerable difficulty was encountered in getting the people to dispose of one wagon load of the big melons.  The next year the scheme met with more favor and each year has seen the consumption increase until the climax was reached last year, Mr. Swink being authority for the statement that 30,000 big melons were disposed of by the hungry crowds.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Swink promises that his people will ship to Omaha several carloads of the finest melons that ever came to this section and will have a watermelon day on the exposition grounds that will eclipse anything in the fruit line ever attempted.  He says melons will be provided for everybody and that no person will be allowed to leave the grounds until he is able to prove that he has eaten at least one melon.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Plan to Have a Great Delegation Early at the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>The commercial organizations and newspaper representatives of California are taking steps in a movement designed to bring to Omaha during the early days of the exposition the editors of the principal newspapers in the country.  The National Editorial association will hold its next meeting in Denver some time in the spring of the coming year, the date not having been fixed.

                            The design of the California people is to have this date fixed after the opening of the exposition with the purpose of then taking such stops as will bring all these newspaper representatives to Omaha to visit the exposition while en route to or from the association meeting.  J. A. Filcher, secretary and manager of the California State Board of Trade, is taking an active interest in the matter on behalf of his organization and writes that if this arrangement can be brought about the editors of California and the Pacific coast will arrange excursions to Omaha and take in the exposition before or after the meeting.  <choice><sic>Hs</sic><corr>He</corr></choice> asks for the co-operation of the exposition management in this plan and this will be given in the most effective manner.  It is thought that if this can be accomplished great good will result to the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="main">DESIGNS FOR THE STAMPS</head>
                            <head type="sub">PROPOSES TO HAVE AN ARTISTIC ISSUE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Calls for Suggestions for the Stamp Which Will Be Commemorative of the Great Western Empire.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Third Assistant Postmaster General Merritt, who will have charge of the selection of subjects for the series of Transmississippi Exposition stamps, which the postmaster general has officially announced will be issued to commemorate the exposition, has written a number of letters to leading artists of the country asking for suggestions relative to designs.  Three divisions are suggested in the letter:</p>
                            <p>First&#8212;That they should contain portraits of distinguished people identified with the country.</p>
                            <p>Second&#8212;Appropriate historical events should be represented as illustrated by existing paintings or engravings.</p>
                            <p>Third&#8212;Unique pictures of national scenery or of other things associated with the progress of the transmississippi region.</p>
                            <p>General Merritt said today that it would be his aim to give the exposition a series of stamps that would be artistic in character and would appeal to all classes of people, and especially typical of the greater west.  Incidentally he suggested that possibly one of the stamps might contain the reproduction of the celebrated etching known as "Fremont Hoisting the Flag on the Rocky Mountains."  The well known statue of Thomas H. Benton at St. Louis contains upon one side of the base a quotation from one for Mr. Benton's celebrated speeches, wherein he outlines the possibilities of the country beyond the Mississippi, and it has been thought that the Benton statue would be an appropriate design for one of the stamps.  The complex picture which hangs in the south corridor of the capitol, known as "Westward-ho," emblematical of the hardships attendant upon the pioneer, and suggested by Bishop Berkley's quotation, "Westward the course of the empire takes its way," was also mentioned by General Merritt.</p>
                            <p>There is a picture in the rotunda of the capitol&#8212;De Soto's discovery of the Mississippi river&#8212;which might also be used upon one of the denominations.  General Merritt said the department would endeavor to select subjects that had been painted or engraved and would not call upon artists to draw new scenes, which wold necessitate a great amount of time, but on the contrary, would endeavor to get photographs, reproductions of famous paintings and personages, so that the engraving of dyes might be quickly done.</p>
                            <p>The stamps will be somewhat of the same shape as the Columbian stamp, twice the size of the present postage stamp.  They will be sought after by collectors, and as there are nearly half a million of these people in the world, the government, instead of being philanthropic, expects to realize handsomely upon the issue.  Columbian stamps today are selling at prices many times higher that was once paid for them and they are growing more valuable each year.  It is the same way with the Centennial stamp, and it will also be true of the Transmississippi stamp.  Suggestions of scenes on stamps are invited by the Postoffice department, as it is General Merritt's desire to give the exposition the handsomest set of stamps ever issued, to commemorate an exposition.</p>
                            <p>Architect Taylor said today that his office had determined to award the entire contract for construction of the government building at Omaha to George E. Moore &amp; Sons.  Bids will, however, be asked for the life-saving station, and just as soon as the officers in charge of the life service have determined upon the display to be made the architects' office will go ahead with the plans.</p>

                            <head type="sub">KLONDIKE AND EXPOSITION ARE WEDDED</head>
                            <head type="sub">Californians with a Carload of Alaskan Products Arrive in the City and Are Immediately Gathered In.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The Klondike and Omaha have been wedded together.  The wooing took place last night through some of the members of the exposition directory and a dozen San Franciscoans who are whirling over the country in a special car containing an Alaskan and Klondike exhibit.  The ceremony will be performed this afternoon at 2 o'clock, at a meeting to be held at the Commercial club.</p>
                            <p>This welding together of interests is the result of the arrival of a special car at the end of the Union Pacific train from the west late yesterday afternoon.  It was a special coach peopled by representatives of the Alaska Trade committee of San Francisco, which is made up of the Merchants' association, the Chamber of Commerce and the Board of Trade of that city.  Besides the people the car was loaded with an exhibit of great interest and all relating to the Klondike.  There were multitudes of furs snatched from the backs of wild beasts of Alaska, specimens of the handiwork of the Indian inhabitants of that country, snowshoes, gold specimens, every part of the outfit that a prospective Klondiker must figure on and a multitude of other things connected with the Yukon district.</p>
                            <p>This car has been sent out by the merchants of San Francisco to induce people of the country to take up a pilgrimage to the Klondike and also to purchase their outfit from San Francisco merchants.  The scheme was found necessary in view of the keen competition among coast cities to secure the trade.  The car left San Francisco a week ago last Tuesday and will go all the way through to New York.  Incidentally the junket is furnishing a royal good time for those on it and the latter are not sparing in dividing their good things with the people who visit them on the car.</p>
                            <p>The plan is being worked after a system.  The car is preceded by a couple of advance men and royal good fellows, L. R. Hare and C. H. Holbrook.  These make arrangements for the reception of the junketers, for the placing of the car where it may be visited and inspected by the public and its objects may be explained and for a lecture on the gold fields, which is delivered by ex-Governor Sheakley of Alaska.  Other information of the Klondike is dispensed by the remainder of the party, which consists of D. M. Carman, secretary of the Alaska Trade committee; Thomas C. Willis, Henry Gray, Thomas McGee, H. J. Taylor, C. M. Jenkins and others, all capitalists or representative business men.  Some of them are accompanied by their wives.</p>
                            <p>Immediately after the arrival of the party here they all went to the Millard hotel, where they took dinner.  Before the meal was finished the visitors were greeted by a number of exposition directors, among them being Messrs. Wattles, Dudley Smith, D. M. Dearing, Babcock and Kirkendall.  An informal reception followed it and it was at this that the exposition and the Klondike exhibit were in a measure combined.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">CAME TO THE EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <p>There will be held in San Francisco from January 24 to 28 next a golden semi-centennial celebration of the discovery of gold in California and following this for several weeks a mining exposition will be held.  This exposition will close some time in May.  The suggestion was made and heartily approved by both exposition directors and San Franciscoans that the entire display should be removed to this city and planted on the exposition grounds.  Regarding this plan Secretary Carman of the trade committee stated that he saw no reason why it should not be followed out and thus furnish an excellent exhibit for California.  He stated that no provision had been made by the legislature for any exhibit and that the state could not expect to get up a good one by means of individual subscriptions.  The mining exposition would furnish an excellent one, for it would not only display the mining industry of the Klondike and of California, but also the fruit and other resources of the latter.  The plan is heartily favored by the Californians and they have also practically agreed to advertise the Transmississippi Exposition equally with the Klondike during the remainder of their junket.  Secretary Carman is of the opinion that great good will result to both from the eastern trip.</p>
                            <p>The San Franciscoans will be the guests of the city today.  At 11 o'clock a delegation of citizens, consisting of Mayor Moores, G. W. Wattles, John E. Utt, T. S. Clarkson, E. A. Benson, C. S. Montgomery, H. J. Penfold, F. J. Burkley and George H. Payne and others, will visit the car and take luncheon with the Californians.  The latter will then be taken for a drive about the city and to the exposition grounds.  Following this the party will be taken to the Commercial club and will be entertained.  At 2 o'clock a public meeting will be held, at which the Klondike will be boomed and the exposition will come in for its share of boosting.  Ex-Governor Sheakly of Alaska will deliver a lecture upon the Klondike region.  The public is especially invited to this meeting.  All day today the car in which the Californians journeyed will be open to the inspection of the public.  It is standing on a sidetrack at the Union depot.</p>
                            <p>A pleasing feature connected with the arrival of the Californians in this city was the meeting of Mr. Wills and a sister whom he had not seen for ten years.  Mr. Wills was completely surprised.  The meeting of brother and sister was an affecting one.</p>
                            <p>The party leave the city for Chicago tonight.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Aggregation to Be Brought to Omaha and Placed in the Boys' and Girls' Building Next Year.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee of the Woman's Board of Managers has decided to secure the international collection of dolls owned by Mrs. Elizabeth R. Horton of Boston and exhibit the same for the benefit of the Girls' and Boys' building to be erected on the exposition grounds.  The collection, as has been heretofore announced, consists of 300 dolls of all sizes and shapes, collected by Mrs. Horton from all corners of the earth, representing the various kinds and conditions of dolls petted, caressed and punished by the rising generation of mothers in every section and of every nationality.  The dolls are dressed in the national costume characteristic of their native land and are said to be a most interesting and instructive collection.</p>
                            <p>The whole aggregation will be brought to Omaha about May 1, 1898, and exhibited in some prominent place down town, the proceeds of the exhibition to be turned into the fund for the erection of the Girls' and Boys' building.  After the exposition is opened the collection will be installed in one of the rooms of the building and an admission fee will be charged for admission to the show.</p>
                            <p>The greater part of the session of the committee yesterday afternoon was taken up in the consideration of routine business, the only matter of general interest before the committee, aside from the doll proposition, being the report of progress made by the congress committee regarding plans for congresses which have been under consideration.  The action of the committee was approved and the matter will be laid before the executive committee of the exposition.  As announced in these columns several days ago, these plans are in an embryonic condition and little of a decisive nature can be announced concerning them.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Advertise for Bids for Construction of Bridges Over Lagoon.</head>
                            <p>The meeting of the Board of Park Commissioners yesterday afternoon was of rather more than ordinary interest, as a couple of important matters were exhaustively discussed.  In the matter of taking up the plan of constructing the bridges over the exposition lagoon there was no particular difference of opinion.  The members had agreed all along that the bridges should be constructed if the work could be done with the funds that were at the command of the board.  President Tukey was instructed to advertise for new bids on a general plan of standard bridge work, each bidder to work out the details according to his own views.  It is believed that in this manner the bridges can be built for less than $10,000.</p>
                            <p>There was a long and somewhat vigorous debate on the proposition which was submitted by Curtiss Turner some months ago to donate certain lots at Thirty-second and Farnam streets for a park boulevard on condition that they should be improved by the board without taxing any part of the cost against certain adjoining lots and also that certain other lots in the vicinity should be exempted from all taxation.  More recently Mr. Turner stated that he proposed to withdraw his proposition unless it was accepted at once and yesterday the committee on improvements of the board recommended that it be accepted.  Other members opposed it and so did City Attorney Connell, who was called in for advice.  Mr. Connell stated that while the idea of parking the worthless ravines in the city was certainly a good one, this was the wrong way to go about it.  He contended that the minute the city accepted the Turner proposition it was committed to the improvement of this ravine.
                            
                            <pb n="172" xml:id="TMISB03-172"/>
                            
                            Then an additional value would attach to the other lots that would be required in order to complete the boulevard and the result would be that the gift of the first few lots would be a very expensive one for the city.  He advised that no such step be taken until the board was ready to do the entire job and then the ravine could be condemned at a comparatively slight expense and most of this could be assessed on adjacent property on account of benefits.  The board decided to postpone action for one week.</p>

                            <p>The electrical dealers of the city held another meeting at the Commercial club to take some action on their grievance that a rule of the exposition directory debars them from doing any of the work of putting in wiring on the exposition grounds.  The dealers carried their troubles by means of a committee to Superintendent Kirkendall of the Department of Grounds and Buildings, but secured such small satisfaction that another meeting was held yesterday.</p>
                            <p>The objectionable rule is: "Commissioners and exhibitors occupying space in buildings must have their wiring installed by the exposition."  After discussing the situation the meeting passed resolutions calling for the abolishment of this rule.  After setting out the reasons for the action the resolutions are as follows:</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the electrical dealers and contractors of Omaha protest against the enforcement of said rule as arbitrary and unjust to the electrical interests of the city, and contrary to the established business principles, and believing that as justice to the men who are established business firms and as subscribers to said exposition association should be permitted to compete for such electrical work; be it further</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That we hereby request the said exposition directory to reconsider its action by which said rule was adopted, and so amend same that all interior work of exhibitors and on buildings may be done by Omaha contractors, subject to the approval of the superintendent of the electrical department of the association and subject to the rules of the National Board of Fire Underwriters and the ordinances of the city of Omaha governing such work.  Should the rule be so amended the subscribers herewith agree to give the Omaha Electrical workers the preference on all work secured and will employ none but union men.</p>

                            <p>So far as the Omaha Fair and Speed association is concerned there will be no state fair held next year on account of the exposition.  That was the decision reached at a meeting of the executive committee of that body yesterday.  The action was taken in a resolution unanimously passed.  This provided that the association was willing to call the fair off on condition that such action would not affect the contract according to which another state fair is to be held in this city in 1899.  The resolution was passed at the request of the Board of Agriculture, which wanted to know how the association felt regarding the matter.</p>
                            <p>The remainder of the evening was spent by the directors in getting installed in their positions and learning the condition of affairs of the association.  In connection with the latter, ex-President Bennett presented a report showing the items with which he had something to do by virtue of his office.  This included an inventory of property and an account of the recent bond issue.  According to this report, over $30,000 of the bonds have been sold, a majority of the subscriptions being paid in.  There is remaining some $4,000 unsold bonds.  It was also learned that with the exception of this bonded indebtedness the association owes nothing and has several hundred dollars in the treasury, enough to pay the first half year's interest on the bonds.  There is still some work connected with the bond matter and therefore Mr. Bennett and Walter G. Clark were appointed a special committee to bring it to a close.</p>
                            <p>The resignation of W. A. Paxton was received, but action was postponed until a subsequent meeting.  Next week's meeting was declared off on account of the holidays and the next meeting was fixed for Thursday, January 6.</p>

The councilmen were given to understand that the executive committee did not have any interest in any settlement that might be made between the city and the water company any further than to see that the exposition is supplied with the water, which is an absolute necessity to the success of the enterprise.  If this result could be accomplished by the city authorities in some other way than through some settlement with the water company, the executive committee explained that it would be entirely satisfied.</p>

                            <p>The stakes are being set for the Horticultural building.  The contract for the carpenter work on this building has been signed by the Westlake Construction company and the work will be commenced on the building within a short time.  This building will stand on the bluff tract between Lothrop and Spencer streets and about midway between Sherman avenue and the edge of the bluff.  It will face north and south, with the long axis of the building running east and west.</p>

                            <p>Word comes from Arkansas that the flourishing town of Fort Smith is making preparations to have an exhibit of its own at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The report comes from Wisconsin that the exposition commission for that state has raised the sum of $6,000 by private subscriptions and has double the amount now in sight.</p>
                            <p>The Dover (N. J.) Index of recent date says that New Jersey will undoubtedly have a state building at the exposition and it urges that the legislature make an appropriation for this purpose.</p>
                            <p>The Board of Trade of Pittsburg, Kan., has taken hold of the matter of a state exhibit to be paid for by private subscriptions and has asked the governor to appoint A. H. Greef of that place as a commissioner.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska papers are taking up the matter of an educational exhibit and are urging all schools to prepare exhibits of their best work to form a part of what promises to be one of the finest educational exhibits ever seen at any exposition.</p>
                            <p>The citizens of Natrona county, Wyoming, held a meeting at Casper recently and appointed a committee of five men to open correspondence with all the other counties in the state and endeavor to organize a movement whereby every county will take part in the work of preparing a big state exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The Colorado Exposition commission has abandoned all idea of trying to raise the private subscriptions and a letter has been sent to each county commissioner in the state asking for appropriations from county boards sufficient to aggregate $30,000.  If this move is not successful a private company will be organized and an exhibit prepared in this way.  This will exclude many portions of the state entirely, but the commission takes the position that the counties now have the matter in their own hands.</p>

Sutherland, editor of the Rocky Mountain Husbandman, published at White Sulphur Springs, the Montana commissioner to the Omaha exposition to be held next year, was in the city on business connected with that work.  He stated that Montana had been assigned excellent space at the exposition and that the outlook for a fine exhibition of this state was very favorable.  In agriculture particularly he thought that Montana would surprise the world, as that is commonly looked upon as once of the least of the state's resources.  In regard to the mineral display he says that his assistant, J. W. Chapman of Butte, had that part in charge, and that the display was going to be a credit to the state.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Committee Formulates Plans Which Will Afford Ample Protection if Mains on the Ground Are Connected with Water Works.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>With the progress that is being made in the erection of the buildings for the exposition the question of fire protection and insurance is becoming an important factor.  A fire which would destroy or partially consume these buildings would be fatal to the exposition, as the time within which the gates must open would be too short to reconstruct them.  In order to obviate this danger as mush as possible every precaution is being observed on the grounds in the use of fires, etc., and a fire company with a chemical engine has been installed in the main court.  Small fire extinguishers are placed in the buildings and the workmen have been instructed in their use.  Other plans are under consideration and will be put in operation as fast as possible.</p>
                            <p>These matters have been arranged by a special committee appointed by the executive committee at the suggestion of Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds.  This committee consists of Insurance Inspector Christian Hartman, Chief John Redell of the Omaha fire department and John H. Butler, city building inspector.  In addition to what has already been done in the way of providing fire protection this committee has recommended still further steps to Manager Kirkendall and these will be laid before the executive committee at an early day.</p>
                            <p>"It is absolutely necessary that the exposition have water connection that will afford fire protection," said Mr. Hartman in speaking of the work of the committee.  "The mains are in the ground and the hydrants are ready to make connections, but there is no water and it would be utterly useless to send a hose company to the grounds in case of fire.  There is no hydrant near enough to the grounds to give any pressure if connection should be made with it.  If water is secured and the plans laid out by the special committee are carried out, the exposition grounds will have first class fire protection and be provided with the best facilities for preventing fires known to modern times.  These plans contemplate a complete system of fire patrol and a police and fire alarm system covering the grounds in such a way that every foot of ground and building will be under constant <choice><sic>susveillance</sic><corr>surveillance</corr></choice>.  The most necessary thing at this time, however, is that connection be made with the mains on the ground so as to afford sufficient pressure to give fire protection."</p>

                            <p>Regarding the insurance question, Mr. Hartman said that the several contractors are required by their contracts to carry insurance to indemnify the exposition management in case of the burning of any of the buildings.  The aim is to have a sufficient amount of insurance to cover the amounts paid the contractors on account of their contracts.  Upon the acceptance of the buildings the exposition will place insurance on each to cover 80 per cent of the cost of the building.  These policies will be continued in force until the close of the exposition and the disposal of the buildings.  Each exhibitor will be required to carry his own insurance.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hartman stated that the form of policy adopted for the use of the exposition and for exhibitors is the same as that used by the World's fair and at the expositions in Atlanta, San Francisco and Nashville.  The method of insuring will be that used by the management of the World's fair.  Mr. Hartman said this form was arranged by the best insurance men in the country and was based on the experience gained in that enterprise, hence no better model could be found anywhere.</p>

                            <head type="sub">CITY OFFICIALS COUNSEL.</head>
                            <p>City Engineer Rosewater, Fire Chief Redell, City Attorney Connell and Councilmen Burmester, Stuht and Lobeck spent the greater part of yesterday afternoon in a thorough investigation of the water works question as connected with the exposition.  President Wattles and W. N. Babcock, who were delegated to represent the Exposition association, could not be present on account of another engagement, but President Wattles stated his views to the city officials during the forenoon and Manager Kirkendall of the Department of Buildings and Grounds came in for a short time.  The only thing the exposition people had to say was that they wanted water and they wanted it badly.  They practically declared that they must have water in order to run the exposition, and that they could not get it themselves.  They then urbanely dumped the responsibility on to the city officials, and intimated that it rested entirely with them whether the exposition should go grandly forward or come to an ignominious end, all on account of their inability to secure a water supply.</p>
                            <p>Left to themselves the officials present set to work to seek a way out of the difficulty.  They drafted plans and made calculations and then talked some more, and invariably came around to one proposition.  That was that if the council refused to grant the extension of the limit of purchase, as is demanded by the Omaha Water company, it would not cost less than $50,000 to supply water for the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Two propositions were considered.  One was to compel the water company to put in hydrants and pay for all the water consumed at meter rates.  If this was done, it was figured that fifty hydrants would be required which would entail a cost to the city of $3,000 a year for ten years.  Then the hydrants which have been put in by the exposition company are not located on the curb lines, and this expenditure of $20,000 would have been wasted.</p>

                            <p>The proposition to supply the water from Cut-Off lake and the Missouri river was considered at length and the calculations showed that the cost of the plant would be about $55,000 in round numbers.  The plan contemplated a pumping capacity of 500,000 gallons a day at the grounds.  The rest of the machinery was figured out as follows:</p>

                            <p>The cost of operation during the exposition was figured at $7,300.  This plant would furnish water for fire protection, the lagoon and for sprinkling, but that used for drinking, cooking, etc., would have to be purchased of the water company at meter rates.  This plan would also involve the sacrifice of the plant which has already been put in at the grounds to a considerable extent.</p>
                            <p>Having accomplished this much, the committee was no nearer an understanding than before.  It was decided that all the information that had been secured should be submitted to the council and then that body will be allowed to take whatever action it sees fit.</p>

                            <p>John C. Bonnell, advertising agent for the Rock Island railroad, called at exposition headquarters with C. R. Rutherford, general agent of that road at Omaha, for the purpose of making arrangements for space in the Agricultural building for an exhibit showing the resources, in an agricultural way, of the territory along the lines of the Rock Island.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bonnell wanted 8,000 feet of space set apart for the display to be made by his road and he was somewhat taken back when he was informed by Superintendent Hardt that it would be impossible to grant that much space to any exhibitor inside the main buildings.  Mr. Hardt said that the greater part of the space in all the buildings had already been applied for, and the best that could be done would be to set apart a space 30x100 feet either on the main floor or in the gallery of the Agriculture building.</p>
                            <p>The Rock Island representative was doubtful if his road could make such an exhibit as it desired in this small space, less than half the amount applied for, and Mr. Hardt suggested that the only alternative would be for the railway company to erect a building of its own on the grounds and install its exhibit therein.  Mr. Bonnell agreed to take this suggestion under consideration and requested that the 3,000 feet offered by the department be reserved for a few days until he could consult with the management of the road.  He then started for Chicago to consult the officers of the Rock Island, promising to return in a few days and make known whether the road would install its exhibit in the Agriculture building or erect a building of its own on the grounds.</p>

                            <p>It is more than probable that among the exhibits in the Manufactures building will be a number of silk looms in full operation weaving book marks.  Judging from samples of the work of these machines and the description accompanying them, these book marks will be souvenirs of the most interesting kind.  They will be about two inches in width and about six inches long, and each will contain a picture of one of the main exposition buildings.  These pictures will be woven in the silk and the work is done by these machines with all the skill of an artist making a sketch in colors.  They are works of art and will form most desirable mementoes of the exposition.  The application for the installation of these looms comes from a New Jersey silk mill, Anderson Brothers, proprietors of the Barnett mills at Paterson, N. J., submitting the application through F. F. Ford, the New Jersey agent of the Department of Exhibits.  The matter is being considered by the Departments of Exhibits and Concessions.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The making of staff work, or stucco, which is to form the outer covering and decoration of the beautiful buildings at the exposition, giving them the appearance of having been chiseled out of the finest marbles and other building stone, is a process which is little understood by the general public, but which is of more than passing interest to those who have opportunity of witnessing the many operations involved in turning out the completed casts.</p>
                            <p>The contracts for the staff work on the large exposition buildings in the main court are nearly all in the hands of Smith &amp; Eastman, experienced contractors in this line, who did a large amount of the work on the World's fair buildings and who have done similar work on many of the largest buildings in this country, prominent among them being the headquarters building of the State, War and Navy departments in Washington, one of the largest buildings of its kind in the world.  These contractors have two shops, one just outside the exposition grounds near Sherman avenue and Pinkney street, and the other in the Mines building, inside the main court.  In these two shops the casts are made which are to transform the huge frames being erected about the Lagoon into palaces of beauty decorated with all the lavishness which characterized the most stately architectural piles of the ancient world.</p>
                            <p>The shop outside the grounds is devoted entirely to the modelers and pattern makers, who prepare the patterns and moulds from which the casts placed upon the buildings are made.  These casts are all made in the shop in the Mines building.  A visit to the modeling shop the latter part of last week found the workmen engaged in making some of the patterns for the staff work which is to decorate the Agricultural building.  The ornamentation of this building is not only very ornate and elaborate, but it is decidedly unique and original.  Architect Cass Gilbert of St. Paul designed this magnificent building and originated its decoration.  In so doing he utilized the vegetable and animal life of an agricultural community and adapted it to his purpose.  The result is a character of decoration which will be most attractive as well as artistic.  It necessitates, however, on the part of the staff workers a tremendous amount of new work in making the models for the casts.  Ordinarily the classic forms of decoration can be adapted to the occasion with a little alteration, but in this case complex patterns must be built up from the beginning.  The same is true to a large extent of the decorations of the other main buildings, the decoration of the Machinery and Electricity building for instance, being formed of cog wheels pinions, incandescent lamps, switches and many other things peculiar to the two sciences to be displayed in the building.  All of these require complete new sets of patterns, so that the decorations of all the main buildings will be peculiar to the Transmississippi Exposition and not a repetition of set architectural design.</p>

                            <head type="sub">IN THE MODELING SHOP.</head>
                            <p>To return to the modeling shop, the first thing striking the eye of the visitor was a modeler in clay engaged in making a pattern for the keystone which is to crown the arch over the main entrance to the Agriculture building.  A large plaster keystone of handsome design, measuring fully two and one-half feet across at the top and about three feet in height, had been utilized as a base on which to build up the striking ornament which will attract the attention of visitors to the big building.  This ornament was nothing more nor less than a big turkey gobbler, life size, with tail outspread and wings drooping, looking for all the world as though he was preparing to step down from his perch and strut about among the chickens, ducks, geese and other barnyard fowls, which were lying around on all sides in counterfeit presentment, "done" in staff and ready to take their places on the Agriculture building.  This keystone will crown the arch of the main entrance only and but one cast of it will be used, but the modeling process is the same as though a hundred gobblers were to be mounted on the
                            
                            <pb n="174" xml:id="TMISB03-174"/>
                            
                            building to add to the picturesqueness of the scene.</p>
                            <p>A second modeler was engaged on a garland of fruits, hanging in a graceful festoon.  This pattern will be repeated many times on the building.  The original model was being formed of clay on a board, the various articles of fruit composing it, like the gobbler, being formed of the plastic clay with the fingers, aided by two or three curiously shaped tools.  The clay used by these workmen is the ordinary potter's clay.  The gumbo so plentiful in this locality was tried by the modelers, but was found to be too sticky and was discarded.</p>
                            <p>Other modelers were engaged in making patterns for capitals for the numerous columns which will form a part of the decoration of the Agricultural building and of the columns themselves.  As a rule the standard types of capitals and columns of the various schools of architecture can be used for patterns with slight changes in the detail of the decoration.  The type of capital is selected and the desired changes are made with clay.  For the plain portions of the cornices the patterns are made of wood and in many cases the moulds from which the cornice is made are also made of wood and the staff moulded in this.</p>
                            <p>In another room the moulds are made from which as many paster casts as are necessary may be made.  These moulds are made of a preparation of glue and gelatin, which is somewhat elastic, and this greatly removes the danger of breaking the cast in removing the mould in case any "undercuts" occur in the model.  On account of the plastic nature of these moulds they are reinforced by plaster backs, the whole making a very bulky affair.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MAKING THE CASTS.</head>
                            <p>After the moulds are made they are taken to the large shop in the Mines building, where the casts are made.  This shop is about 250 feet in length and about fifty feet wide.  It has a low roof and is lighted dimly by skylights.  About thirty men are employed in this shop.  A mould is laid on a low table and covered with a light coating of oil to prevent the plaster from sticking.  Two workmen then take a huge pan about the size of a washtub and partially fill it with water.  Into this is slowly sifter hard wall plaster, which is thoroughly mixed until a thick paste is formed.  This is poured over the inner surface of the mould with small pans and spattered with the hands into every nook and corner of the mould.  This material "sets" very rapidly and the face of the mould is quickly covered to a depth of about a quarter of an inch.  Hemp fiber is then taken in small wisps and dipped into the large pan of plaster and spread over the inner side of the cast.  This process is repeated <choice><sic>unti</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> the whole cast has reached a thickness of about an inch and one-half.  It is allowed to stand about half an hour, by which time it becomes thoroughly "set," and it is then removed from the mould and is carried out of the shop to be placed with its fellows in the long rows of white casts which fill the big Mines building on every side.</p>
                            <p>When these casts are first taken out they are quite wet and they smoke and steam in the frosty air as if they were hot.  During the cold weather now prevailing the casts freeze and become like huge chunks of ice.  They do not dry out, but can be handled and are put on the buildings in this frozen state.  When thawed out by the warmth of the sun they will dry and retain their place and shape as well as though thoroughly dried before being put on the building.  They are handled like so much lumber, being sawed and mitred to make close joints and nailed in place like boards.  In warm weather the holes made by the nails, as well as the openings left in making joints, will be carefully gone over by a workman with plaster and all inaccuracies and holes "pointed up," making a continuous surface without any joints.</p>
                            <p>The plain surfaces of the buildings are covered with plaster in the ordinary way, during suitable weather, the plaster being brought up to the stucco and covering the entire building.</p>

                            <p>Postmaster General Gary has written the following letter to Manager Edward Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion of the exposition regarding the souvenir postage stamps which are to be issued by the government in honor of the exposition:</p>
                            <p>"Upon the receipts of your letter of the 13th inst.  I immediately considered the proposition contained therein as to the issue of a special set of stamps to commemorate the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be held in your city next year, and have decided to issue a set of the denominations of 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents and $1.  The time is short, however, in which to prepare for this issue, and we are desirous of having any suggestions you may wish to offer to aid us in selecting the proper designs for stamps.  Will you not kindly give me your views as early as possible on that point?  We are receiving suggestions from other sources and out of the abundance of material from which to choose we hope to be able to select designs that will be satisfactory, not only to the department, but to the exposition authorities.  Kindly give prompt attention to this matter, as it will take nearly all the time between now and the opening of your exposition to prepare the dies for printing the stamps."</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater desires to receive suggestions from anyone who thinks he has an original idea regarding the designs to be placed on these stamps.  The Postoffice department wishes to make these stamps desirable from an artistic standpoint and also to make them illustrative of the transmississippi region and the Department of Publicity and Promotion wishes to render all possible assistance in the matter.</p>

                            <p>The moves being made among the gamblers of Omaha to have everything run "wide open" during the exposition is attracting a great deal of attention all over the country and numerous editorial comments are made on the matter by the newspapers.  The following from the Muscatine, Ia., Journal of recent date is a fair illustration of the character of the comment made:</p>
                            <p>"Omaha gamblers, who hope to run wide open during the Transmississippi Exposition are rejoicing over the turning down by the courts of a state law which made gambling a felony as 'unconstitutional.'  Yet the county attorney at Omaha says he can find plenty of good law to thwart them.  And the exposition authorities ought to see that he does his duty, or else with the 200 extra saloons that have taken out licenses for next year, running, as they usually do, each a gambling annex there will be such a gang of toughs in that city that it will be absolutely unsafe for people to go there to see the exposition."</p>

                            <head type="sub">CITY ENGINEER ON EXPOSITION WATER</head>
                            <head type="sub">Plan Whereby Domestic Service and Fire Protection Can Be Afforded at a Most Moderate Cost.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The time is approaching when the members of the city council will be compelled to vote one way or the other on the water works ordinance which was introduced two weeks ago at the request of the exposition management.  Although the question has been in process of almost continuous agitation in the meantime the councilmen are no nearer agreeing on the proposition than they were in the first place and with one or two exceptions they are still reluctant to forecast their action when the ordinance comes to a vote.  It appears quite probable that the ordinance will be passed, but the opposition is still vigorous and the votes for the ordinance cannot be counted on with certainty.</p>
                            <p>Since Saturday, when the subject was exhaustively considered in the office of City Engineer Rosewater, that official has worked out what he regards as a feasible plan to furnish the exposition with water in case it is not considered advisable to waive the right of purchase.  In the first place he asserts that the statement of the exposition officials that they will require 1,000,000 gallons of water a day is considerably exaggerated.  He has made careful calculations of the maximum amount that will be required for all purposes and finds that the aggregate is about half the amount contended for.  He contends that there is no question but that the water company can be compelled to furnish any amount that is required at meter rates and that in view of the rate at which water is furnished to the city a rate of ten cents per 1,000 gallons could be obtained.  This would make the water charge $50 a day, or about $7,500 for the entire exposition.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">DETAILS OF THE PLAN.</head>
                            <p>The city engineer contends that the matter of fire protection can be easily provided for.  While the city could not compel the water company to put in hydrants except at a heavy expense, it has the undoubted right to do what it pleases with the water which is has purchased and paid for at meter rates.  His plan is to make the lagoon furnish the water supply for fire fighting, if any is needed.  The lagoon will hold 13,000,000 gallons, and the greatest amount that would be required to fight even a big fire would not exceed 500,000.  Consequently, the lagoon would furnish a reserve supply largely in excess of what would be needed in any emergency.  The only question remaining is how the necessary pressure is to be secured.  Mr. Rosewater believes that the most satisfactory plan would be to put in a big stationary engine, which could be rented at a reasonable figure for the exposition, even if some enterprising concern was not willing to put in the engine on account of the free advertising it would receive.  This pump could be connected with the lagoon and the hydrant system which has been already put in by the exposition company, and in case of fire the water could be pumped from the lagoon and shot into the mains at any pressure desired.</p>
                            <p>This plan, together with the detailed figures showing the cost of putting in the engine and boilers, expense of operation, etc., will be submitted to the council, and it will be vigorously supported by those councilmen who are opposed to making any concession to the water company.</p>
                            <p>The members who favor the ordinance contend that the city has no funds that can be used to assist the exposition people at this time, and that the only way in which water can be furnished is by passing the ordinance and giving the water company the concession that is demanded.  They declare that there is not the slightest possibility that the city will be able to purchase the plant in 1903, and that consequently the concession is no concession at all.  They urge the fact that water for fire protection has become an imperative necessity at the exposition grounds, as the buildings have now advanced to a stage where a fire would practically wipe out every prospect for the exposition.</p>

Mr. Mattox was connected with the wild west show at the World's fair and also at the San Francisco exposition, and Mr. Miller is a banker of Tennessee.

                            <head type="sub">Everything Free and Everything Put to Use by the Merry Crowds Who Fill the Ice and Slides.</head>
                            <p>This was children's day at the exposition grounds, and when the gate keepers came on duty they found small knots of boys standing about the gates making the foggy air ring with their shouts.  They made at once for the toboggan slide as soon as the gates were opened and their number was rapidly increased by new arrivals until the ground seemed to be alive with them.  There were big boys and little boys, white boys and black boys, boys with good clothes and boys whose bare skin showed through numerous rents in well worn clothes.  Most of them scorned to wear an overcoat, but all were provided with skates.  There was every variety of skate known to mankind.  The new club skate from the latest Christmas tree knocked against the "Dutch runner" with an old fashioned wood top, which had been resurrected from some forgotten corner in the old garret.  There were club skates with the antiquated heel plate arrangement and the modern variety with clamps fore and aft.  Some of the youngsters followed the example of the forefathers and used small pieces of wood to tighten the straps after pulling them as tight as possible, but any small inconveniences like this were lost sight of in the general scramble for a good time.</p>
                            <p>Every boy in the crowd climbed the long incline leading to the top of the toboggan slide only to find that there were no toboggans there.  Not to be cheated of a ride, however, some procured small pieces of board and, seating themselves on this, were whirled down the chute with the speed of the wind.  Others disdained the use of such a vehicle and sat boldly down on the bosom of their knickerbockers.  With a shove from the boys standing around they were off with a shout, but few of them undertook this trip more than once, as the covering provided by nature was all that was left to guard their anatomy from the frosty air.</p>
                            <p>The smooth ice at the west end of the lagoon was literally covered with joyous humanity, the small boy and his sister being in evidence on every side.  They arrived before the ice men had finished "making ice" for the day and several men were required to keep them off the new ice until it had hardened.  As the day advanced the crowd increased, the older children coming in slowly, but the small boy held his own all day and succeeded in getting his full measure of enjoyment out of the performance.</p>

                            <p>Architect John Latenser, the superintendent of the new postoffice building, who is also charged with the duty of supervising the construction of the Government building at the exposition grounds, has received instructions from the office of the supervising architect of the Treasury department to make an immediate report on the progress which has been made on the Government building.  Mr. Latenser infers from this that preparations are being made to change the plans to make the Government building larger in accordance with the act of congress in increasing the appropriation for the building.  The appropriation referred to will increase the size of the building to the length originally designed.  When bids for the construction of the building were opened they were found to exceed the appropriation and the size of the building was reduced to bring the cost within the amount available.  This was accomplished by cutting off a portion of each wing, but the wings will now be extended to the point originally contemplated.</p>

                            <p>Governor Culberson of Texas has notified the exposition management that he has appointed S. J. T. Johnson of Corsicana to be vice president of the exposition for Texas.  Mr. Johnson was a member of the committee on resolutions at the Houston convention which was attended by the delegation from Nebraska and as such member showed interest in the series of resolutions prepared by the committee providing for a Texas Exposition commission, to be appointed by the state vice president.  Governor Culberson told several members of the Nebraska delegation at Dallas that he would be careful in appointing the next vice president to select a man who would take an interest in the matter of state representation and push it vigorously.  Two former vice presidents for Texas resigned on account of urgent private business and the governor said he would try to avoid future complications in this direction.</p>

                            <p>The Merchants' Review of New York, the official organ of the retail grocers, in its issue of December 24 devotes a column and a half to news of the exposition, including a few paragraphs covering the plan and scope, and editorials urging upon the people of the east the importance of not letting slip the opportunity of getting in touch with the Gate City of the West.  Another editorial states that New York will soon follow the example of New Jersey and have a state commission and an exhibit.  It gives the credit for the strong sentiment in this matter to the energetic efforts of Major. T. F. Bickford, general eastern commissioner for the Publicity and Promotion department, and E. O. Halstead, commercial agent for the Department of Exhibits.</p>

                            <p>gram.)&#8212;Congressman Mercer will have charge of the Indian congress bill while that measure is in the house committee, notwithstanding his statement that he would not ask for any additional appropriation for the Omaha exposition during the Fifty-fifth congress providing an additional sum to complete the government building according to original plans should be diverted from the money appropriated for a government exhibit.  Mercer was forced into making this statement by opponents of expositions generally, but stated today that it had no bearing whatever upon the assemblage of representative Indian families at Omaha during the coming year.  He said that the bill as introduced provides for a congress of representative Indian families, and also provides that the congress should be held between June and November but that it had no direct bearing on the Omaha exposition.  If it should turn out that the exposition authorities would grant space for a congress of the Indian tribes, that was a matter entirely outside the scope of the present bill.  The statement of Mercer has been so variously construed that he deemed this explanation necessary in view of the fact that members of the populist party had indicated that they would not be bound by Mercer's statement made in the heat of debate and at a time when the issue at stake was not very apparent.</p>
                            <p>It is Senator Allen's intention to put the bill on its passage through the senate immediately after the convening of congress next week, and he feels certain that there will be a good strong majority in its favor, even though it should come to a stand-up fight on the floor.  A great many senators have replied to the senator's letter of explanation regarding the merits of the bill and have signified their willingness to do what they can toward helping it along to its final passage.</p>

                            <p>City Engineer Rosewater submitted his proposition concerning water at the exposition at the regular council committee proposition at the regular council committee yesterday afternoon.  President Wattles and Secretary Wakefield of the exposition association were present as well as the entire council and City Attorney Connell.  The exposition officials did not regard Mr. Rosewater's scheme favorably.  They declared that his figures on the quantity of water that would be required were too low and that not less than 1,000,000 gallons a day would answer the purpose.  City Attorney Connell said that it was very doubtful whether the council could compel the water company to furnish water for a temporary and extraordinary purpose even by paying the meter rates.  In any case the plan meant an expenditure of nearly $50,000, including the amount that had already been expended by the exposition association in putting in mains and hydrants.  The discussion occupied nearly the entire afternoon and left the situation as much muddled as before.</p>

                            <head type="sub">He Finds a Decidedly Favorable Sentiment Among Painters and Sculptors, While Owners Are Very Friendly.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>A. H. Griffiths, art director of the exposition, is in the city to consult with the exposition management regarding the art exhibit.  He will remain in the city for a day or two and will then return again to the east.  Mr. Griffiths expresses himself well satisfied with the measure of success attending his efforts to collect a sufficient number of pictures of recognized merit to make a most creditable showing and says that the art exhibit of the Transmississippi Exposition will take a high rank among the expositions in this country as an artistic exhibition.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Griffiths says that when he first commenced his work, early in the summer, he encountered considerable difficulty in inducing artists and owners of valuable paintings to allow them to be exhibited at Omaha, the objection being made that the exposition was only a small affair, like those of Nashville and Atlanta, and the owners did not care to take the risk attendant upon the shipment and exhibition of their priceless treasures.  This sentiment has been entirely changed within the last few months, and Mr. Griffiths anticipates no considerable difficulty in securing a collection that will be highly creditable from an artistic standpoint.  The people in the art centers are now well aware that the Transmississippi Exposition is to be an exhibition in which more than half of the states of the union are directly interested, and they were willing that their works of art shall be exhibited here.</p>
                            <p>Another thing which Mr. Griffiths says is forming a strong inducement for artists to send their best pictures here for exhibition is the fact that no medals are to be awarded for the pictures declared to be the best and that no prizes are offered.  Instead of these empty honors a syndicate of wealthy men will expend a stipulated amount of money in buying pictures, and this is more of an inducement to artists than a bushel of medals and diplomas.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PICTURES ALREADY SECURED.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Griffiths now has about sixty pictures from the Nashville collection stored in the vault of the Detroit Art museum, of which he is the director.  These, together with a large collection of Scotch pictures from the Nashville exposition, which are in Mr. Griffiths' control, will be exhibited during the spring in eastern cities and then brought to Omaha to be installed in the Art building.  About forty other pictures selected from the Nashville collection and a number selected from the collection at the St. Louis exposition are now in the east and will be shown at the usual spring exhibitions and then sent to Omaha.  The art director says he now has about 300 or 400 pictures in sight for the art exhibit, as well as a number of pieces of fine statuary, casts, etc.</p>
                            <p>In a conversation with R. Hall McCormick in Chicago Mr. Griffiths found the Chicago millionaire disposed to be very liberal with the Transmississippi Exposition in the way of loaning some of his priceless pictures.  Mr. McCormich is the Illinois representative of the art bureau and his approval is necessary on any picture from Illinois before it will be received by the exposition for exhibition.  He promised Mr. Griffiths to give the matter of loaning some of his pictures most favorable consideration and the art director will consult with him on his return to Chicago the latter part of the week.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Griffiths will not go to Europe until some time early in the spring.  He has a representative there, however, who is working under his direction and is making good headway in securing desirable pictures.  Among other pictures which Mr. Griffiths is trying to secure is one which was awarded the first prize at the last Paris salon.  It is the work of a young colored man, the son of Bishop Turner of the African Methodist church.  The picture is said to be a magnificent work, depicting the raising of Lazarus, and has attracted worldwide attention.</p>
                            <p>"I understand that objection has already been raised to exhibition of the famous painting 'The Fall of Babylon,'" said Mr. Griffiths.  "I sent a photograph of the picture here some months ago and I understand that some influential people have objected to its exhibition.  This picture is one of the finest examples of realistic art extant.  I hope no serious objection will be raised to it, as it is recognized as one of the standards of its class."</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;It is expected the government board in charge of the Omaha exhibit will meet this week or early next week to reapportion the space and amount of money for exhibition purposes to the several departments made necessary by the enlarged dimensions of the building.  Members of the board are not feeling especially jubilant over the turn affairs are taking as to the bill introduced by Allen in the senate and Mercer in the house to correct certain administrative features in the old bill making an appropriation for the government exhibit.  There are certain features in the new bill which the members of the board will be called upon to explain and this is taken to be a slap at the board, when the reverse was intended by the ways and means committee of the house and international exposition committee of the senate.  The question of how far the government board can go as to the purchase of exhibits is the subject that comes up for the committee to decide.  The purchasing clause is necessary in order to make new cases and tables and to surround pictures with new frames, the wear and tear at Atlanta and Nashville having made the government exhibit look old.  As for the provision for a disbursing officer, Mr. Kemper of the Treasury department was emphatic in favor of the proposed amendment.  It is understood that Mr. Kemper has written a letter to Representative Mercer, wherein he takes exception to the latter's statements that at both Atlanta and Nashville too much money was spent on transportation and subsistence.  Supervising Architect Taylor has added $7,950 to the bid of George Moore &amp; Sons, for extending the wings of the government building at Omaha thirty-three feet in length.  The Life Savings department of the government is engaged in outlining plans for the life saving station at the exposition and as soon as these are completed the supervising architect will direct plans to be made for the building.</p>

                            <p>The water question in the city council has now reached a stage at which it requires a good memory to remember its various convolutions.  The first move was made by the exposition management in a communication, which was practically a request that the city should waive the right of purchase of the plant in 1903 in return for free water for the exposition.  The communication and an ordinance carrying it into effect were referred to the committee on fire, water and police.  Then Stuht chipped in with a resolution declaring against the ordinance and providing that the city should take immediate <choice><sic>stepts</sic><corr>steps</corr></choice> to furnish the exposition with water independently of the water company.  This went to the same committee and the report was returned without recommendation, but with a statement from City Engineer Rosewater showing the cost of providing water by purchase at meter rates in case the water company could be compelled to sell the water.  Then W. S. Poppleton secured an injunction restraining the council from taking any further action in the matter, and about twenty of the heaviest property owners in the city united in a petition asking the council not to waive the right of purchase.</p>

                            <p>For the present at least the city council will not be able to pass the ordinance waiving the right of purchase of the plant of the Omaha Water company without getting in contempt of the district court.  Yesterday afternoon W. S. Poppleton appeared before Judge Scott with an application for an injunction to enjoin the mayor and city council from passing the ordinance.  The application was set for hearing at 10 a. m., December 31, and a restraining order was issued.  By the terms of the order the mayor and council are enjoined "from passing, approving or taking any steps toward enacting or adopting an ordinance introduced into the city council December 14, 1897, entitled, 'An ordinance to amend section 14 of ordinance No. 423,' and referred to in petition filed herein.  And restraining and enjoining said defendants and each of them and their successors in office from passing, approving or taking any steps toward enacting or adopting the proposition of the Omaha Water company made to the city council of Omaha and introduced into the council December 14, 1897.  And enjoining the said defendants and each of them and their successors from passing, approving or taking any steps toward enacting or adopting any other ordinance, resolution or proposition or contract which shall in any manner or to any extent whatever embarrass, curtail, weaken, diminish, put off or change the right of the city of Omaha, under ordinance 423 and the laws of the state of Nebraska, to acquire by purchase under the exercise of the right of eminent domain, or under the laws of the city or state, or contract of contracts, heretofore entered into with said company, the water works plant a present supplying the city of Omaha, upon the plaintiff executing an undertaking in the sums of $1,000, as required by law."</p>
                            <p>Copies of the order were served on the city officials just before the council meeting last night.  As no action on the ordinance was contemplated at this meeting, the order involved no change in the proceedings.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>HELENA, Mont., Dec. 28.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;William H. Sutherlin, Omaha Exposition commissioner for Montana, has moved his headquarters from White Sulphur Springs to Helena.  He has secured offices in the Montana National Bank building, from where he will direct the work of securing a Montana exhibit for the Transmississippi Exposition, which will open June 1 next.  Mr. Sutherlin found it necessary to centralize the work, and as all parts of the state are more readily reached from Helena than any other city he naturally established his headquarters in the capital.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Sutherlin is confident that Montana will have a creditable exhibit at the Omaha exposition in every particular.  He has practically arranged the agricultural and horticultural exhibit, almost everything in that line being now ready for shipment to Nebraska's metropolis.  He is at present engaged in collecting material for a mineral exhibit and is meeting with encouraging success.  Mr. Sutherlin believes that the mining exhibit will be much more representative of the state's principal industry than the Montana exhibit at the World's fair.  There will be more of it, and it will be arranged as to be of much practical benefit to the state.</p>

                            <p>"Without reflecting upon those having it in charge, I will say that the Montana mineral exhibit at the World's fair was not at all satisfactory," said Mr. Sutherlin.  "In the first place, it did not have a good space, and then there were not enough assistants to attend to the exhibit and answer the question of inquiring sightseers.  The World's fair exhibit, for the most part, was merely a collection of minerals and metals&#8212;interesting, to be sure, but of little practical value to the mines represented there.  I propose to systematize the Omaha exhibit and group the specimens into districts as much as possible and plainly label each one.  Those labels will tell the reader from what mine the specimen was taken, the value and character of the ore and something of the development of the mine.  Such information will convey intelligence to prospective investors that should be worth something, not only to them, but the mine owners themselves.  Our whole aim will be to make an honest representation of the mines of Montana and so attract the attention of investors to what this state offers.</p>

                            <p>"The mining men of the state have shown an encouraging interest in this enterprise.  When their attention has been called to the object of the exhibit they have co-operated with me as well as I could wish.  All I ask of the mine owners or managers is for them to take out specimens of their ores and furnish me the desired information as to their character, and something about the mine itself, if they wish, and I will label the pieces, box them up and ship them to Omaha.  We will have a larger and more <choice><sic>representattive</sic><corr>representative</corr></choice> exhibit of minerals at Omaha than at the World's fair.  I expect to have all of the principal districts of the state represented, the ores from each district to be grouped together.  I am having some difficulty in obtaining specimens of exclusively silver ore, but my collection of gold ores, and gold and silver, and galena ores is large and growing.</p>
                            <p>"The Montana mining exhibit will have one of the four best positions in the Mines and Mining building.  It will occupy a space 30x60 feet at one corner of the building and there is not a better position in the <choice><sic>biulding</sic><corr>building</corr></choice> and there is not a better position in the building than the one allotted us.</p>
                            <p>"We were not so fortunate in securing a place for our agricultural and horticultural exhibits.  Still, it is not a bad position, and we will have a very creditable showing indeed.  Our space in the Agricultural building will be 24x50 feet.  I have already secured exhibits from all the leading agricultural sections of the state.  No prominent section has been omitted, but if I had had more money for this work I could have made it still more complete.  In this work I have had the assistance of about a dozen men, not all of whom, however, have been under pay.</p>

                            <p>"The horticultural exhibit will doubtless surprise many thousands of persons who will see it.  It will be amazing to persons who have never considered the possibilities of Montana as a fruit raising state.  We have a large number of jars of fruits preserved and they are very showy and representative of what this state can do in the fruit growing line.  In addition to the preserved specimens we will have such other fruits in fresh form as will be possible to exhibit during the exposition.  Marcus Daly's Bitter Root ranch furnished some of the finest specimens of fruit that we now have.</p>
                            <p>"I had hoped that Montana would have a timber exhibit, but am very much afraid that our funds will not allow us to branch out in this direction.  Montana's timber interests are immense and should be represented at this great exposition if possible.</p>
                            <p>"On the whole, I think Montana will have reason to be proud of the showing made in its name at the Transmississippi Exposition.  I will frankly say that it will not be as good as it could have been made had there been plenty of money to defray the necessary expenses of collecting, shipping and afterward arranging the exhibits, but it will, nevertheless, be a credit to the state.  I am convinced that the benefits to the state from this exhibit will be many times more than what it cost.  It will divert capital to this state and that is what we need more than any other thing.  We have more natural resources than any other state in the union, and it is to our interest to let them be known.  It pays to advertise, and this exposition exhibit will be the best kind of an advertisement for Montana and its people."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Contractor Puts in Vouchers for Thirty and Precipitates an Investigation&#8212;Result of the Commission's Inquiry.</head>
                            <p>The greater part of the session of the Nebraska Exposition commission at the Millard hotel today was devoted to an executive session to consider a charge that had been made that Contractor Fagan, who has the contract for putting the roofing on the Nebraska building, was having his employes make false affidavits in turning in their pay vouchers.  It developed in the investigation that the contractor was pursuing a course common in business between individuals and was turning in the pay of his men at 30 cents per hour, whereas the men were getting but 15 cents per hour.  As the state was paying the men and they were <choice><sic>compelld to swar</sic><corr>compelled to swear</corr></choice> to the correctness of their vouchers it was evident that they were committing perjury.  The contractor explained that he was boarding the men and furnishing the tools with which they worked, the 15 cents per hour being his pay for these items.  The matter was straightened out by allowing the men $1.50 per day, the minimum under the law, and paying Fagan for the use of his tools at the rate of $1.50 per day.</p>
                            <p>In this investigation it developed that the roof was not being completed as rapidly as possible.  Fagan and his men had been working but six days and it was decided that the entire force at work on the building should be put on the roof and kept at that work until the building is entirely under cover.</p>
                            <p>Charles F. Catlin appeared before the board in the interest of his scheme to decorate the interior of the Nebraska building with the work of Nebraska artists..  He submitted a lengthy communication outlining his plan and stated that an appropriation of $250 would be necessary for the contingent expenses.  He also intimated that it would be necessary to employ some competent man to take charge of the matter at a salary of about $125 a month.  He was asked if he had any one to suggest for this soft berth, but declined, with becoming modesty, to make any suggestions in that connection.  The commission decided to adopt the suggestion as far as using Nebraska art for decorative purposes, but provided that L. C. Chapin of Lincoln, superintendent of the Floral bureau, should be consulted at all.</p>

                            <p>Art Director Griffith appeared before the executive committee of the exposition at its meeting yesterday afternoon and urged upon the committee the necessity of constructing a fire and burglar proof vault in connection with the Art building in which pictures and other very valuable works of art might be stored at night away from all harm by fire or thieves.  Although the Art building will be a fireproof structure Mr. Griffith said owners of valuable paintings would not consent to having them sent here unless every precaution is taken to guard against injury or loss.</p>
                            <p>After discussing the matter the executive committee coincided with the art director and the vault will be constructed at once.</p>
                            <p>The committee authorized a contract to be made with Richard W. Bock, a Chicago sculptor, to make the statuary for the Machinery and Electricity building.  A full description of this statuary was printed in The Bee a few days ago.  The several groups designed by Architect Perkins include thirteen heroic human figures ten or twelve feet high, nine large lions, two rams, two hounds and four eagles.  Mr. Bock offered to make all of them and put them in position on the building, including the necessary painting to make them conform in tone to the building, for the sum of $4,000.  The architects-in-chief strongly recommended the awarding of the contract to Bock, and Architect Perkins presented a strong argument in writing.  This is the first of the buildings for which arrangements have been completed for statuary.</p>

                            <p>SALT LAKE, Utah, Dec. 28.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;Mr. Cederstrom is just in from the Pelican Point onyx mines, and reports all assessment work now done, and also that the mines look better than ever before.  A large amount of very fine onyx is now in sight and can be got at very easily.  It is expected that in a few weeks a large windmill will be put in running order at the mines to run the machinery for cutting and polishing and turning blocks of onyx.  Mr. Cederstrom expects to make a very fine exhibit at the Omaha exhibition next June, and will no doubt attend in person, as he thoroughly understands his business, when it comes to the handling of this stone.  He is a good carver in stone and will show very fine specimens of his handiwork.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Contractors Hurry Everything to Get Ahead of Another Snow Storm&#8212;Finishing Touches on the Exteriors.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The exposition ground is a sea of mud.  In the main court, especially, the combination of melted snow and Nebraska soil has made a mixture which covers the ground to a depth of about two inches.  The only apparent effect, however, is to diminish the number of visitors.  Few people have the courage or the disposition to battle with the mud in an effort to see what the exposition grounds look like and the workmen have a clear field.  They are making the most of it.</p>
                            <p>A snowstorm would do little damage now.  Nearly all of the buildings are under roof.  The carpenter work on the roof of all of this is practically finished and if it was not for the delay on the part of the people supplying the translucent fabric for covering the skylights the buildings would be entirely covered.  The roof of the Agriculture building has been completed, with the exception of this skylight covering, for two weeks and the recent heavy snow could have done no damage if the skylight material had been put on when the roof was ready for it.  The material is now being put on and will be completed in about two days if there is no further delay.  The workmen who are putting on the rubberoid and gravel roofing follow closely behind the men with the translucent fabric and the entire north side of the roof of the Agriculture building is now completed.  The workmen are engaged on the south side and are making goof progress.  The carpenter work on the exterior of this building is almost completed.  The carpenters are putting the finishing touches on the corner pavilions and around the cornice.  The plasterers are putting up their staging for covering the north wall.</p>
                            <p>The roof of the Mines building is being covered with rubberoid and gravel roofing, the former being used on the central portion, which has considerable slope, and the gravel being used on the flat portions, which will be used for promenades.  The corner pavilions on the west end have been finished and those at the east end of the building are being rapidly completed.  The plasterers are working on the north wall of this building and have it nearly covered.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ROOFERS DELAYED.</head>
                            <p>The Machinery building is another building which is being delayed by the non-arrival of the fabric for the skylight.  The roof has been ready for several days and could be entirely close up in a short time if the material was at hand.  The roofers are delayed, as they cannot proceed until this material is in place.  The remainder of the building is progressing satisfactorily.  The windows are being put in place in the clear story, and as much interior work being done as is safe so long as the rain and snow has free entry via the roof.  The staff workers are making good progress on this building and the clear story is assuming a finished appearance which is very attractive.</p>
                            <p>The roof of the Manufactures building is completed except the rubberoid covering on the pavilions, and workmen are now employed on those.</p>
                            <p>The roof of the Liberal Arts building is in an advanced stage.  The skylights have been covered and the rubberoid roofing is being put in place.  The gravel roofers have not yet commenced work, but the board covering of the roof is sufficiently tight to keep out the snow or rain.</p>
                            <p>It will be seen that these buildings are so far advanced that the most severe weather can have but little effect on building operations on any of them except the Machinery building.  The carpenter work that remains to be done is nearly all inside work and there is comparatively little of that.  In view of these facts the contractors on the building heretofore referred to have commenced reducing their forces and a few men are laid off every week.  Any of these buildings could be entirely completed within thirty days if there was any necessity for this to be done.</p>
                            <p>The Art building is making rapid progress.  As many men are employed as can be handled to advantage and both sections of the building are rising rapidly skyward.  The walls of the east section are nearly all in place and the west section is following close behind.</p>
                            <p>The Auditorium is assuming a finished appearance.  The side walls are finished and the sheathing is being put on the sides of the roof.  The trusses are being framed in the position they are to occupy on the building, thus obviating the necessity of raising them.  The interior of this building is being carried along at the same time and has reached an advanced stage.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PUTTING UP THE SEALS.</head>
                            <p>One of the finishing touches has been put in place on the Administration building.  This is one of the large seals which will decorate the large panel forming one of the sides of the arch.  The west seal has been completed and is in place.  The seal which is to adorn the opposite panel is not finished, but the niche it is to occupy is prepared for it.  The west seal is that of the state of Nebraska.  The seal proper is circular in shape, being formed of staff.  It is about four feet in diameter, the seal being in bas relief.  The figure of the blacksmith stands out in strong relief, while in the background is seen the steamboat, railway train and other features entering into the state seal.  The whole is white, but when the proper colors are laid on the effect will be most pleasing.  The seal is surrounded by a heavy, ornamental scroll, the whole decoration being 8x10 feet in size.</p>
                            <p>The seal which is to go in the east panel is that of the city of Omaha.  This will be the same size as the Nebraska seal, and the surrounding scroll work is in place.</p>
                            <p>At the rate the Government building has been progressing since work was commenced on the superstructure it will not be completed for about two years.  But nineteen men are employed on it and the progress made from day to day could scarcely be discerned with a magnifying glass.  The contractor or superintendent who has charge of the work keeps himself locked in the temporary office building erected between the Government building and the lagoon, and his version of the delay could not be obtained.  It was reported that the delay is caused by the recent action of the government in increasing the size of the building.  This could scarcely be the case, because the increase simply makes the building the size originally contemplated and on which bids were submitted.  When the structure was reduced in size about thirty feet was taken out of the east and west walls of each wing and the ends moved that much nearer the center.  No change was made in the construction of the central part of the building.  The contractor has put up the side walls and end of the south wing and has raised a few of the posts which are to form a part of the support of the dome.  A few of the posts of the north wing are also in place, but no attempt has been made to push the work on the central portion of the building, which will not be interfered with in the least by the change in the plans.</p>

                            <p>The Rocky Mountain Husbandman of White Sulphur Springs, Mont., whose editor is one of the commissioners of the Montana commission of the exposition, says that a portion of the grains and grasses collected in Yellowstone valley for exhibition at the Transmississippi and International Exposition in Omaha next year has been destroyed.  The work of collecting exhibits in Yellowstone valley was principally done by Mr. I. D. O'Donnell of Billings.  Being secretary of the Yellowstone fair, Mr. O'Donnell stored the exhibits in floral hall at the fair grounds where he considered them perfectly safe, and they could be kept without expense to the state.  Arrangements had been made to pack the exhibits in boxes and ready for shipment to Omaha, but the work was deferred on account of a delay in the delivery of a portion of the grains from farms in the neighborhood.  The loss will not materially affect the display at Omaha, says the Husbandman, as Mr. Sutherlin has secured a very large collection in other parts of the state, but it will be damaging to the Yellowstone valley region.  Mr. Sutherlin had taken care to make a fine, large collection in this section of the state and hoped to give it especial prominence on account of the opportunities of inducing immigration now developing through the work of the arid land commission.  We cannot conceive what would prompt any person to commit so grievous a wrong to a community.  Intending locators take an especial interest in examining the products raised, and it is especially important to Yellowstone that it be well represented.  Mr. O'Donnell is using his best endeavor to replenish the exhibits, and it is hoped that the farmers will render him all of the assistance possible.</p>

                            <p>ATLANTA, Ga., Dec. 29.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Georgia will have one of the best exhibits at Omaha.  The material collected for the Atlanta and Nashville expositions is on hand, and will be supplemented by popular subscription.  The railroads will help on transportation and probably add important exhibits of their own.  Assistant General Superintendent J. S. B. Thompson of the Southern railway, President Thomas K. Scott of the Georgia railway, President George C. Smith of the Atlanta &amp; West Point and Western of Alabama railways, and Charles E. Harman, general passenger agent of the Western &amp; Atlantic railroad, are members of the state commission, and will use the strength of their positions to promote the success of the Georgia exhibit.  The Southern railway, Western &amp; Atlantic and Georgia railway have fine collections, and the Georgia exhibit will doubtless be the nucleus of a fine display from the railroad of the Piedmont states, Georgia, the Carolinas and Alabama.</p>
                            <p>Governor Atkinson enthusiastically says: "I will do all in my power to make this the best exhibit Georgia has ever had at an exposition.  We have on hand material it would cost $15,000 to duplicate, that we can easily bring up to date and supplement.  If a creditable exhibit is started I will ask for a Georgia day and will go there to see the state well represented.  In that event I would take a military escort equally as imposing, if not more so, than the state had at Nashville on Georgia day."</p>

                            <p>Secretary Holmes of the Manufacturers' and Consumers' association spent his Christmas at Burlington, Ia.  While there he met his old friend, Brigadier General James A. Guest, who commands the Second brigade, Iowa National Guard.  General Guest, in the course of a conversation on exposition topics, touched on the mobilization of the militia at Omaha during the exposition.  He expressed himself as very much in favor of the encampment of the Iowa guard at Council Bluffs during the summer of 1898, and went into some detail in explaining his efforts to bring about this end.  General Guest is of the opinion that the gathering of the militia at Council Bluffs will be a good thing for the men, as well as affording an attraction for the exposition.  He explains that it will be contrary to law and custom for the Iowa guard to leave the state for the purposes of encampment, but thinks that the camp across the river will be close enough.  He hopes that the main idea of a general encampment can be carried out.  It will be necessary for the citizens to assist some, in case both brigades of the Iowa forces are brought together at the same time, which General Guest hopes to see.  The camp equipage supplied by the state is only sufficient to outfit one brigade.</p>

                            <p>The action of the Postoffice department in deciding to issue a special postage stamp in honor of the Transmississippi and International Exposition has been heralded to the world through the columns <choice><sic>o fevery</sic><corr>of every</corr></choice> newspaper in the country which prints the reports of the Associated Press, and also those having special correspondents at Washington.  The amount of advertising that the exposition is receiving by this means is simply tremendous and is attracting more attention than could be excited in any other way.  This is the only instance, except the World's fair, in which a special postage stamp has been issued as a recognition of expositions, and goes to establish the important character of the event.</p>

                            <p>The committee was prepared to submit its report, but before this point in the proceedings was reached, J. Y.

                            <head type="sub">Strong Resolution Adopted at the General Session&#8212;Short Review of the Sectional Work of Yesterday.</head>
                            <p>LINCOLN, Dec. 29.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;The State Teachers' association has been growing in size as well as in interest today.  The total enrollment at 6 o'clock this evening is 1,060, by far the largest ever registered at an association meeting.  The inadequacy of the Oliver theater to hold the crowd last night has brought forth much discussion on the problem of a hall large enough to hold the meetings hereafter and a proposition has been made by the people of Lincoln who are pushing the new auditorium.  They offer to furnish the meeting place for the association free of cost for the next two years if the association will donate $300 to the auditorium fund.</p>
                            <p>The question of holding an educational congress at Omaha next year is also receiving much attention and the opinion is unanimous in favor of the idea.  At the Oliver theater meeting the following resolution was offered and adopted without a dissenting vote:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, It is proposed to hold in Omaha during the progress of the Transmississippi and International Exposition, which continues from June 1 to November 1, 1898, a gathering of the teachers of the region west of the Mississippi, and</p>
                            <p>Whereas, This educational meeting, if held, will give thousands of those engaged in school work in this region an opportunity to benefit by the inspiration of such a great meeting at the same time that they attend the exposition, therefore, be it</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That we, the teachers assembled in our annual state association, do hereby express our approval of the plan to hold such a meeting in Omaha during the time mentioned above, provided that such a meeting is arranged upon dates which will not in any way conflict or interfere with the meeting of the National Educational association to be held in Washington, D. C., July 7 to 12, 1898; and we pledge ourselves to co-operate in any way practicable for advancing the enterprise, the organizing and success of the meeting as described above.</p>
                            <p>Resolved further, That the secretary of this association be instructed to forward at the close of this meeting a copy of these resolutions to the secretary of the committees having the project in charge&#8212;Miss Anna Foss, principal Kellom school, Omaha, Neb.</p>

                            <p>ATLANTA, Ga., Dec. 30.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Today at noon the commission appointed by Governor Atkinson to provide for an exhibit of Georgia's resources and products at the Transmississippi Exposition met and organized by electing ex-Governor Northen as chairman.  The commission consists of leading railroad presidents, editors and businessmen in Georgia which sent forty carloads of provisions to Nebraska three years ago.  The meeting today developed enthusiastic feeling in favor of a Georgia exhibit at Omaha.  Georgia had the finest state display at the Nashville Exposition, but this will be a mere nucleus for what the state will bring to Omaha.  From all parts of the state cordial responses come to invitations to join in the movement for a Georgia exhibit at Omaha, which will surpass any that has been made even at Georgia's own expositions.</p>

                            <head type="sub">STYLE OF BUILDINGS UNDER CONSIDERATION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Architects-in-Chief Decide on Swiss as the General Feature of the Architecture, with Some Slight Modifications.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The style of the architecture of the buildings which are to be erected on the north tract of the exposition grounds is engaging the attention of the architects-in-chief of the exposition, now that the drawings for the buildings and architectural embellishments of the main court and the structures for the bluff tract are practically out of the way.  As has been said many times, the design of the architects-in-chief has been to concentrate the stunning effect in the main court and the measure of success which has attended their efforts in this direction is daily becoming more apparent as the magnificence of the stately main buildings is revealed as the work progresses.  The bluff tract having been set aside for the state buildings, the architects-in-chief have little to do in that direction except to exercise sufficient supervision to guard against architectural monstrosities.  There will be a number of buildings on the north tract, however, and it is the selection of the style which shall dominate these that has been under consideration.</p>
                            <p>It has been decided that the style of architecture prevailing among the farming districts of picturesque Switzerland shall be followed in making the designs for the buildings which are to be erected on the north tract.  This style is charming in its simplicity and pleasing to the eye.  In a general way it may be described as a style which brings the heavy timbers of the building into prominence, these timbers remaining uncovered.  The space between the timbers is covered with a rough coating of plaster.  The timbers will be painted a dark red color, technically known as burnt sienna, and the plaster will remain the natural color.</p>
                            <p>The idea of the architects is that this character of construction will act as a foil for the elaborate buildings of the main court and will form a pleasing contrast to them.</p>
                            <p>Prominent among the buildings on the north tract will be the Transportation building.  The preliminary sketches for this structure have been made, but have not yet been approved by the executive committee.  These sketches provide for a building designed in the Swiss style referred to, the building to be about 400x600 feet in size.  As at present contemplated it will stand a little east of Twentieth street, about the middle of the old fair grounds.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">ADAPT IT TO A BRIDGE.</head>
                            <p>Following out the decision of the architects-in-chief regarding the style of architecture to be used on the north tract, the viaduct which will afford a passageway from the north end of the bluff tract across Sherman avenue to the old fair grounds will form a pleasing example of Swiss architecture.  The trusses supporting this viaduct will be of the cantilever style and the sides of the roadway will be formed by miniature Swiss chalets, in each of which will be installed merchants with small wares of various kinds, giving the viaduct the appearance of a street in a Swiss village.  The plans and specifications for this viaduct will be turned over to the Department of Buildings and Grounds within a few days and bids will be asked for construction.</p>
                            <p>The plans and specifications for the colonnades which are to form covered passageways from the Government building to the Agriculture building on the north side of the lagoon and the Art building on the south side have been completed by the architects-in-chief and turned over to the Department of Buildings and Grounds.  Bids for the construction of these colonnades will be asked at once.</p>
                            <p>These two colonnades will form an important feature of the general design of the main court.  Starting at the west end of the Agriculture building the north colonnade begins with a handsome pavilion, extends due west a short distance and then describes a wide circle around the bank of the Mirror, being forty feet from the water.  When near the Government building it changes direction slightly, running in a southwesterly direction to the point where the north wing of the Government building joins the main body of the structure.  There are four pavilions in each of the colonnades and these, with the handsome design of the colonnades proper, form a handsome and striking setting for the broad Mirror and the stately Government building.  The style of the architecture used in these colonnades is Pompeiian Doric and it is the intention to enhance the beauty of this portion of the ground by a liberal use of foliage along the colonnades, adding to their beauty.  In addition to adding to the architectural beauty of the west end of the main court the colonnades will afford a covered passageway twelve feet in width entirely around the Mirror, and it is thought that this shady walk will be very popular when the sun is shining on the exposition grounds.</p>

                            <p>The force in the office of the architects-in-chief is now working on the drawings for the two large restaurant buildings which are to form the east end of the viaduct leading from the main court across Sherman avenue to the Bluff tract, and the colonnades and pavilions which are to form the exedra at the east end of the main court leading to the viaduct.  These drawings are well under way and are nearing completion.</p>
                            <p>The detail drawings for the Moorish village have been completed and several contractors are now figuring on the plans preparatory to putting in bids for the construction of the several beautiful buildings which will form one of the most attractive features of the Midway.</p>

                            <p>A mechanical genius has applied to the Department of Concessions for the privilege of installing and operating a wonderful contrivance which he calls "rolling the roll."  He proposes to construct a track on the order of a switchback, about seventy-five feet in length, and for cars he has immense tubs, seven feet in diameter, with seats inside.  The passengers who desire to take the thrilling voyage are strapped in these seats and the tub starts on its trip.  Tub and passengers are rolled over and over with lightning speed, the track being built on a sharp incline.  At the end opposite the starting point the tub strikes against heavy springs which starts it off in the opposite direction down another incline.  When the end of the journey is reached the tub is directly beneath the starting point and the passengers are lifted out and the tub is raised to the higher platform, where it is ready for another load.  The promoter of this extraordinary contrivance says he has operated it in several places in the east, where it met with great favor.  He says the motion is rather unusual, but is not disagreeable after a trial or two.</p>

                            <p>One side of the water works question was discussed with much vigor at the council chamber last night.  If there was any sentiment on the other side it was not in evidence.  There was a fair representation of property owners, among whom were Guy C. Barton, John D. Howe, P. E. Iler, J. B. Kitchen, J. M. Kenney, W. O. Saunders, John Powers, Ferdinand Streitz, Henry W. Yates, Herman Kountze, John L. Webster, Thomas Swift, Thomas Kilpatrick, J. J. Points, S. Jonasen and James E. Boyd.  The entire evening was occupied by a series of speeches, which expressed unanimous opposition to the ordinance now before the council, by which it is proposed to waive the right of the city to purchase the plant until 1908.  The members of the council and other city officials were present, but with one or two exceptions they took no part in the discussion except to propound an occasional query to one of the speakers.</p>
                            <p>President Bingham of the city council called the meeting to order and stated that the members of the council were present merely to listen to what the property owners had to say.  J. B. Kitchen was made chairman, Mr. Bingham declining to serve in that capacity.  There was some delay in beginning the discussion, as no one seemed inclined to take the initiative.  Finally a labor delegate suggested that some of the councilmen who favored the ordinance should state their reasons.  President Bingham submitted the demurrer of the councilmen, which was based on the fact that this was a citizens' meeting at which they were merely listeners.  John D. Howe called for the reading of Stuht's minority report on his resolution and the motion was amended to include the majority report.  While City Clerk Higby went after the document City Engineer Rosewater was called on.  He said in the beginning that his report, which was included in both committee reports, dealt merely with plans for providing a water supply for the exposition and not with the question of extension.  He briefly stated the result of his investigations as contained in his report.  The reports were then read in full.</p>

                            <p>Kountze was called on.  He said that he had come to hear what the councilmen had to say in favor of the ordinance rather than to talk.  He did not wish to advocate anything that was unfair to the water company or to the exposition, but he believed that it was the duty of the city council to protect the interests of the city first.  He contended that to waive the right of purchase was too great a price to pay for the service desired and that the city should take no step that would interfere with the purchase of the plant in 1903.  He was as much interested in the success of the exposition as any man in Omaha, but he did not believe that the city should barter away valuable rights for a nominal sum as was proposed by the ordinance under discussion.</p>
                            <p>Henry W. Yates referred to the proposed extension as a sacrifice of municipal interests for a mess of pottage.  He said that in the original water works controversy in 1880 the right of purchase in twenty years was regarded as one of the most important features of the contract.  Some eight years ago the question of an extension had been disposed of by the <choice><sic>givorous</sic><corr>vigorous</corr></choice> opposition of property owners.  He contended that the twenty years dated from the passage of the ordinance in 1880 and that the right of purchase consequently matured in 1900.  It was purely a business proposition and the money that would be expended by the city and the exposition company in carrying out the plan submitted by the city engineer was a mere bagatelle in comparison with what the city proposed to give away by this ordinance.  He attacked the statement that the city was not in a position to buy the water plant by quoting figures to show that municipal bonds were being floated at 3 and 3½ per cent.  Money was never cheaper and the city could never enjoy a more favorable opportunity to float bonds to purchase the plant.  He then gave a succession of figures to show what the extension meant to the water company.  It would bond its plant for $11,000,000 and the city of Omaha would indirectly pay the 6 per cent interest on these bonds instead of paying 3½ per cent on the amount of bonds that would be required to effect the purchase of the plant.  He urged the council to refuse to pass the ordinance and instruct the city attorney to take an appeal from the recent decision of Judge Munger.  Then if the water company refused to furnish water for the exposition its franchise would be forfeited and the city could proceed at once to acquire the plant.</p>

                            <p>Guy C. Barton said that when the water works franchise was granted it was conceded that the rates were exorbitant, but admitted that the inception of such an enterprise at that time justified high rates.  But the Omaha of that day bore no comparison to the present city.  The limit of the time during which the city must bear this onerous burden had been fixed at twenty year, and it expired in 1900.  The city council should see that the load was not imposed for an additional period.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WEBSTER WANTS TO KNOW.</head>
                            <p>John L. Webster wanted to know where this ordinance came from.  It was said to have been submitted by the exposition directory, but the members of that body had told him they were opposed to any extension of the water works franchise.  In reply to the alleged statement of the water company's officials that they could not furnish water for the exposition without enlarging their plant Mr. Webster said that the sworn statement of these officials, which was on file in the United States court, was that they had the capacity to furnish 18,000,000 gallons of water a day, exclusive of the Burt street pumping station, which could supply 6,000,000 gallons a day additional.  The same testimony was that the maximum consumption in Omaha was only 14,000,000 gallons a day, thus leaving the plant a surplus capacity of 10,000,000 gallons daily.</p>
                            <p>Continuing, Mr. Webster called attention to the fact that the owner of the Bee building contributed $5,000 to the exposition, while this immense corporation, which drew $300,000 a year from the municipal treasury, and was capitalized for $11,000,000, had only given $3,000, and now when the exposition company asked for water it was made a condition that the water company should receive this extension of its franchise.  He predicted that if it was settled that the exposition company would put in an independent water plant the water company would come to time in less than forty-eight hours.</p>
                            <p>President Bingham answered Mr. Webster's first interrogation by stating that the ordinance had been brought to the council by the exposition people, who have practically declared that unless water was provided the exposition would never open its gates.</p>

                            <head type="sub">HOWE IS SURPRISED.</head>
                            <p>John D. Howe said he was gratified, but somewhat surprised to hear that President Wattles had brought in this ordinance.  Where did he get it?  Who told him what section to amend?  Was there any doubt where he got his inspiration?  This extension was worth millions of dollars to the water company and it was worth just as much to the city.  And it was proposed to give it away for a months' water supply.  He declared that the city council should unanimously oppose the proposition.  He made a vigorous argument along the line of municipal ownership and warned the council that if the right of purchase should be frittered away now it might be lost for all time.</p>
                            <p>J. M. Kenney made the speech that he didn't get a chance to complete at the meeting two weeks ago.  He referred very sarcastically to that occasion and declared that he had seen letters written by President Wattles to prominent citizens asking them to be present and advocate the passage of the ordinance.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kountze finally brought the matter to a focus by moving that it be declared the sense of the meeting that the council should immediately order the water company to make connections with the mains on the exposition grounds.  This was carried by a unanimous vote and succeeded by a post mortem discussion which accomplished nothing except to prolong the session.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Yates then offered a resolution by which the city council was requested to instruct the city attorney to appeal the recent water works case.  He said in support of his resolution that he had the opinion of John L. Webster that Judge Munger's decision would be reversed on appeal, and that was good enough for him.</p>
                            <p>City Engineer Rosewater said that the city was not concerned in this case.  This was in the interest of outside parties, and the city should not step in to be a catspaw for the Venner interests.  The resolution received a few scattering votes and was declared adopted.  The same action was taken on a subsequent resolution by Mr. Kountze, which expressed the sense of the meeting that the council should take no action contemplating the waiver of the right of purchase.</p>

                            <head type="sub">DEMAND THAT NO SPECIAL STAMP ISSUE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Argue that Collectors Will Have to Buy Them if They Are Put Out, and Consequently Spend Money.</head>
                            <p>The action of Postmaster General Gary in deciding to issue a series of special postage stamps in honor of the Transmississippi and International Exposition has raised an indignant protest from some stamp collectors, who see this action of the department nothing but a prospective raid on their pocketbooks.  They are formulating protests to the Postoffice department, in which they insist that the idea should be abandoned.  These collectors all use the same argument against the issue of special stamps by the United States government.  The following copy of a letter sent to the postmaster general by a Chicago dealer in stamps shows the argument used by them:</p>
                            <p>Postmaster General Gary: Dear Sir&#8212;I wish to register a protest against the issue of special commemorative stamps for the Omaha exposition, and respectfully urge that the idea of their issue be reconsidered and abandoned.  Since the issue of the Columbian set in 1893, or more strictly in the last few years, the custom of emitting special stamps to celebrate occasions of varying national importance has been abused, especially by minor countries that consider such issues primarily as a convenient means through which to replenish governmental exchequers by the sale of stamps to philatelists, that the commemorative issues have lost all charm and novelty to the philatelist or stamp collector.  Rather, the philatelist now views special, unnecessary issues with disfavor and impatience.</p>
                            <p>By resorting to the hackneyed plan of providing special stamps for the Omaha exposition, you will unwittingly disquiet stamp collectors, and, in consequence, exercise a sinister effect on the stamp business.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Publicity and Promotion of the exposition, through which the special stamp issue was secured, Manager Rosewater having urged the matter with the postmaster general and various other officials and congressmen ending in Washington recently, is not greatly alarmed about the efforts being made by the stamp collectors to ward off what they regard as a deep laid plot to get into their pocketbooks.  This special stamp issue is regarded as one of the most effective moves made by the federal government so far as the exposition is concerned.  It fixes more firmly in the public mind the importance of the exposition as a national and international affair, and the widespread effect on the exposition of the action of the Postoffice department is almost incalculable.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Ice Carnival Concession Changes Hands&#8212;Concessionaire's Plans.</head>
                            <p>The ice carnival concession at the exposition grounds has changed hands, having been sold by Norris &amp; Love to Thomas Swobe of this city.  The negotiations for this deal have been in progress for several days and were completed late yesterday afternoon when the papers were signed and Mr. Swobe took formal possession at midnight.</p>
                            <p>"i saw that this concession was a big thing," said Mr. Swobe, this morning, in speaking of his new business deal, "and I have been considering for some time how it could be secured.  The opportunity presented itself a few days ago and I took advantage of it.  I have looked into the details sufficiently to know that the concession is an excellent one.  I shall give it my personal supervision and shall see to it that nothing is left undone to make it a success in every respect.  The arrangements made by Norris &amp; Love for the ice carnival, the curling and toboggan clubs and all the other amusement features, will be carried out and I am now working on an elaborate plan which will eclipse anything which has been proposed in the way of entertainment.  The matter is not in shape to make public at this time, but it will be ready for full announcement in the Sunday papers of January 9.</p>
                            <p>"The public can rest assured," continued Mr. Swobe, "that the ice carnival is going to be a big thing and that a series of events is in prospect that will eclipse anything in the line of winter festivities ever attempted in this part of the country."</p>
                            <p>The first official move made by Concessionaire Swobe after taking charge of the winter concession was to appoint W. L. Mardis in charge of the ice gang.  His duty will be to see that the ice is kept in condition at all times.  Mr. Mardis and a crew under his direction worked all of last night on the ice in the lagoon and this morning the broad surface was like a sheet of glass.  Not a lump or a soft spot were to be seen and the ice was as hard as flint.</p>

                            <p>As a class American workingmen are intelligent, as well as skillful, but what they lack is intelligent and honest leadership.  As a class the men who seek to lead them do not want to work, but prefer to make a living by agitation.  In order to create a want for their services they often precipitate contests which are not in the interest of the wage workers and advocate policies that are actually to the detriment of the bread winners.  For example, the recent action of the Board of County Commissioners in setting apart $75,000 toward defraying the cost of the exposition buildings is being denounced by men who claim to speak for labor as injurious to the working classes.  How such a conclusion can be reached by any intelligent person passes our comprehension.  In what way could the commissioners have promoted the interest of workingmen better than by devoting the bulk of the proceeds of the bond sale toward the erection of exposition buildings?  How could the money have been expended to greater advantage to workingmen?  While it is true that the buildings toward which the county is contributing were planned and some of them contracted for before the bond proposition had been ratified, it was well understood on all hands that the proceeds of the bonds would go toward aiding the exposition in carrying out the plans for a creditable exhibit.  That did not mean that the money should be expended in buildings expressly designed for exhibiting the industrial products of this city and county, but for structures in which these products should have a proper place with those of other localities in this and other states.  Nobody in or out of Omaha had any right to expect that the county would use the proceeds of the bonds for the purchase of articles to be exhibited, whether these articles were the product of the farm, orchard and dairy or of the mill and factory.</p>
                            <p>Had such a course been pursued the workingman's share of the outlay would have been much less that it will be when paid in wages to members of the building trades.  To say that the exposition managers would have completed the necessary buildings in any event and without aid from the county is an assumption that is far-fetched.  With all the aid they can possibly get from the city, county and state and with every dollar of stock subscription paid in the managers will still be short $200,000 before they can pay for all the buildings that will be required by the extraordinary demand for space that comes from all sections of the United States and from foreign countries.  It is a condition and not a theory by which they are confronted.  Instead of obstructing the men who are struggling night and day to make the exposition a success, the workingmen should join with them in every effort to secure more aid for the great task that has been loaded upon their shoulders.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Reproduction of Mormon Tabernacle to Be a Feature.</head>
                            <p>SALT LAKE, Jan. 1.&#8212;(Special Correspondence of The Bee.)&#8212;A reproduction of the Mormon tabernacle will be one of the novel and attractive features of Utah's exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition.  The material used in the construction of the model of this famous building will be Utah onyx, which varies in color from pure white to all shades of lemon and orange yellows.  The root of the miniature tabernacle will be hollowed from a solid block of onyx.  The material is found in ledges and may be obtained from the quarry in any size desired singularly free from flaws or imperfections.  The forty exterior pillars, which will support the roof and contribute to the massive solidity of the building, will afford ample opportunity for displaying the mirrorlike surface of the polished onyx, and electric lights on the interior of the building will reveal the transparent properties of this beautiful material, which has only recently been discovered within the boundaries of the new state.  The work of the building will be done by Olaf Nilson of Salt Lake City, an expert marble cutter who made the onyx casket to contain the Book of Mormon which was recently presented to King Oscar of Sweden.</p>
                            <p>Silk culture, an industry which was introduced into Utah by Brigham Young almost forty years ago, has been given a new impetus by the appointment of a state silk commission and by the payment of a state silk commission and by the payment of a bounty of 15 cents for each pound of cocoons raised in the state.  Efforts are being made to have a complete working exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition, which will demonstrate the development attained by this industry in Utah during the last five years.  The women of Utah who have engaged in this work have not only succeeded in raising cocoons of extra good quality, but have added to their knowledge the art of reeling the silk from the cocoons with marked success.</p>
                            <p>A silk flag formed a part of the decorations of the tabernacle last July when the pioneers celebrated their entrance into the valley.  This flag, which was two yards long and weighed a pound a quarter, was made from silk raised, reeled and woven in Utah.</p>
                            <p>Silk culture is an industry which is yet in its infancy in the United States, and one which offers a new and broad field for women.  The task of reeling the silk is particularly adapted to women, as it requires a light yet accurate touch, and the Utah exhibit will be of extraordinary interest, as it is proposed to show the progress of silk reeling as carried on by Mormon women.</p>

                            <head type="sub">"Bureau of Courtesy," Whose Members Will Make it Their Business to Aid Anyone Who May Ask Assistance.</head>
                            <p>A "bureau of courtesy" is a novel association of which the Real Estate exchange is sponsor.  Its sole duty will be to see that courteous treatment is given every visitor to the city this year, so that all may go away with the impression that the transmississippi country is as much on the top of the heap in the matter of politeness as in hogs and corn and minerals.</p>
                            <p>The bureau is to be quite a comprehensive one.  It will be directed by a committee appointed by the exposition directory and this body will be in command of an army of men and women.  In fact, as many of the people as possible of this city  will be enrolled in the ranks of bureau.  There will be a barbers' league, a street car men's league, a children's league, and so on through all the occupations and positions in Omaha's social life.</p>
                            <p>Each member of the bureau will carry a button or badge and visitors will be privileged to address at any time or place any wearer of this insignia for the purpose of getting information of any sort.  The bureau member will be pledged to give up all he knows, and if that does not satisfy his questioner he will take the trouble of directing him to some one who can give the additional information.</p>
                            <p>According to this scheme an exposition visitor can strike any Omaha citizen for information in a barber shop, theater, street car or anywhere else.  If the man approached cannot answer the questions he will take the inquirer into the nearest barber shop in case a barber is likely to give the desired information, or into a shoe shop if a shoeman is likely to be the possessor of the knowledge and so on.  It is believed that by this plan visitors will come to the conclusion that Omaha is the center of politeness of the universe.</p>
                            <p>The scheme was outlined at noon today at the meeting of the Real Estate exchange, by a committee appointed to get something of the kind, consisting of Members Benson, Selden and Harder.  The scheme was well received, and the committee was continued to work up public sentiment in its favor.</p>
                            <p>The special committee appointed to draw up a form of contract between real estate agents and property owners for the placing with the former of property to be sold reported progress and was continued in force.  The matter was discussed at some length and a number of suggestions was made.  Some such contract form is required, since the last legislature passed an act which provides that a real estate dealer can collect commissions for sale of property only when he has a written agreement from the property owner authorizing him to make the sale.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Shriver reported that he had received a number of responses from cities along the route of the regent exchange trip to Texas in answer to the resolutions passed by the exchange, thanking the city for the courtesies extended.  Among the number were very cordial letters from Chairman H. B. Cullum of the Deep Water Utilization committee of Galveston and Secretary Tom Richardson of the Houston Business league of Houston.  The trip resulted in arousing a big amount of interest in the coming exposition in Texas.</p>

The desire of the exposition management is to make this arch a permanent structure, which shall remain for all time as a memorial of the exposition and a monument typical of the transmississippi states, located at the gateway of the vast region lying toward the setting sun.  At the request of the executive committee of the exposition Governor Holcomb has requested each state and territory in the transmississippi region, through its chief executive, to furnish a small quantity of building stone, sufficient for one course, to form a part of this arch.</p>
                            <p>The design for this arch shows a handsome and imposing structure of pleasing proportions.  It is designed to span the Twentieth street boulevard at the main entrance of the exposition grounds.  The arch is to be about seventy feet in width and about ninety feet in height.  A high arched passageway will afford ample room for entrance of the crowds which will throng the grounds and will afford plenty of space for the passage of vehicles after the arch shall have performed its function as an exposition gateway and become a monument of western progress.</p>
                            <p>The striking feature of the arch will be the decoration of the frieze and it is this which gives the arch its name of Arch of the States.  The frieze will be finished in Moorish design, with a number of superimposed arches.  In each of the niches thus afforded will be placed a seal of one of the transmississippi states or territories, the seals or coats-of-arms of the United States, surmounted by an immense eagle holding in its talons the olive branch and bunch of arrows.</p>

                            <head type="sub">REQUIRED OF THE STATES.</head>
                            <p>The letter sent by Governor Holcomb to the governor of each transmississippi state asks the state to furnish stone sufficient for one course in this arch, and requests that samples of the building stone quarried in each state be sent to the architects-in-chief of the exposition that they may indicate which variety was most acceptable in order that the harmony of color might be preserved.  While sufficient time has not elapsed for replies to be received, it is evident from articles appearing in the newspapers published at the state capitals and from telegraphic dispatches from those points that the governors are taking an active interest in the matter.  Several of them have requested the stone quarries in their states to at once submit samples of stone to them for transmission to Omaha as requested and it is probable that favorable responses to the request of the governor will soon be received.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion has been especially active in urging this means of securing a permanent memento of the exposition and appeared before the Nebraska Exposition commission to urge that body to supply the foundation and first course of the Arch of States on which the other states might erect the balance of the structure.</p>
                            <p>"There is a great variety of building stone quarried in many of the transmississippi states," said Mr. Rosewater, in discussing this matter, "and there are few of them which do not produce any stone.  Some of them have a dozen or more different kinds, and it would be an easy matter to select varieties which will harmonize in color and make a structure which will be pleasing to the eye.  A very small quantity of stone will be required from each state so that the task of supplying the stone will not be a burden on any of them, and the exposition management will supply all the finishing touches, besides doing the work of constructing the arch.</p>
                            <p>"My idea would be to make this arch a memorial arch in every sense.  The courses of stone and the coat-of-arms will accomplish this to a considerable degree, but I shall advocate the placing of stone tablets on either side of the archway and cutting into these the names of the governor, state officers and exposition commission of each state, thereby making it a lasting monument of the transmississippi region and of the year of the great exposition of the magnificent resources of that section."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Vice President Johnson Outlines His Plan of Campaign.</head>
                            <p>The Galveston News of December 25 prints the following interview with Captain S. J. T. Johnson of Corsicana, who was recently appointed vice president of the exposition for Texas by Governor Culberson:</p>
                            <p>I shall accept the appointment made by Governor Culberson yesterday tendering me the position of vice president for Texas for the Transmississippi and International Exposition.</p>
                            <p>I have felt all along much interest in this exposition, for I believe that the proper representation of Texas products will mean much to the state.  I am of the opinion that there will be in the next few years a great deal of immigration from the northwest into this section of the country, and if Texas realizes the benefit to be derived from the exhibit of her products she will be well represented at the Omaha Exposition.</p>
                            <p>The products from that section of the country which have to be exported should be sent through Texas seaport cities.  They raise much grain, corn, etc., and there is a close commercial relation between the two sections.  To my mind an exhibit to this exposition will be of more benefit to Texas than that which may have been made to any exposition yet held.  I sincerely hope that our people will take hold of the matter in a substantial manner and let the Lone Star state be represented as it has never before been placed before the public.  To do this we must have the hearty co-operation first of every railroad in Texas.  In fact, I am of the opinion that we can absolutely accomplish nothing unless the railroads display a liberal policy toward the enterprise.</p>
                            <p>Of course they derive much benefit.  If Texas is well represented there will be many Texans who will visit the exposition who otherwise would not go.  If freight comes from that section this way of course the railroads will handle it, and I desire to say this early that it is my intention to have, if possible, at an early day, a meeting of the railroad managers to take up this matter and come to an early conclusion.</p>
                            <p>It will be my aim to effect a thorough organization in the state, as was favored by the meeting held in Houston the first part of the month.  There the convention thought it advisable for the vice president to appoint a second vice president from each senatorial district in the state, and they further decided that it was advisable for all of them to meet in convention at the call of the state vice president and to proceed to organize the state into further subdivisions with such officers as was thought proper and expedient for the furtherance of the enterprise.</p>
                            <p>I shall put myself in communication with parties in each of the thirty-one senatorial districts in the state, looking to the selection of acceptable senatorial chairmen.</p>
                            <p>My experience with the senatorial exhibits which have been heretofore sent from Texas to other exposition is that, as a rule, men have been selected to do certain work who did not feel much interest in it.  This was especially so with reference to the Nashville exposition.</p>
                            <p>This is as much as I care to say at this time.  I might conclude, however, by saying that we must have the hearty co-operation of the state press.  I realize that the press is a power and it can make an interest in the exhibit so that we can have a display that will reflect much credit upon the state.</p>

                            <p>Superintendent Pearse is continually receiving letters from prominent educators which endorse the plan of holding a Transmississippi Educational congress in connection with the exposition.  Out of twenty-five communications received up to date only two are opposed to the enterprise.  Two more give it a cautious approval, and the remainder are enthusiastic in their expressions of approval and co-operation.  This result is regarded as the most encouraging that could possibly be expected, and indicates that the leading educators of the country can be depended on to give their active support to the enterprise.</p>
                            <p>Aside from individual opinions, the leading educational organizations of the west are also getting into line.  The Nebraska State Teachers' association gave the scheme all possible impetus at its meeting, held at Lincoln last week, and Superintendent Pearse has received copies of similar resolutions which have been adopted by the state associations of Minnesota, Iowa and Kansas.  These are the three most powerful state associations of the west, and there is little question of securing the co-operation of the other transmississippi states.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GENERAL SCHEME OF ORNAMENTATION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Exterior Designs Will Indicate the Uses to Which the Building Itself is Devoted&#8212;Chaste but Effective.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>At no former exposition held in this country has the ornamental and decorative work of the main buildings and of the principal promenade been so elaborate and chaste as that which will characterize the main court of the Transmississippi Exposition.  This statement has been made in these columns heretofore, but as the stately buildings which are to border the canal, which forms the central motive of the main court, take on tangible form the full force of the assertion impresses itself upon the mind of the visitor to the grounds.  The harmony of the architectural proportions of these buildings challenges the admiration, while the evidence of the entrancing beauty of the completed scene is multiplying rapidly.</p>
                            <p>Even in the natural condition of the staff&#8212;a dazzling white, which has grown rather monotonous in connection with the expositions, principally because it has not the festival appearance which the gaiety of the occasion warrants&#8212;even this marble-like appearance conveys an impression of sombre grandeur which carries the mind of the visitor to the stately cities of the old world whose architectural beauty has never been excelled.  But when it is remembered that the graceful and beautiful designs are to be made still more beautiful by the skillful use of color to heighten the architectural effect, then it is that the beholder begins to comprehend the full force of the opening statement of this article.</p>
                            <p>The Transmississippi and International Exposition will not only differ from all former American expositions in the respect of the use of color, but the character of the ornamentation will also be different.  The decoration of each building will indicate at a glance the general character of the exhibits which will be within its walls.  On the Machinery and Electricity building, for instance, the various articles used in these arts will be freely used, and on the Agriculture building the liberal use of conventionalized cabbage heads and other agricultural products, as well as domestic animals, will clearly indicate the use to which the building is devoted.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SIMPLE EXTERIOR ORNAMENTS.</head>
                            <p>The manner in which this unusual character of decoration is made to conform to the conventional architectural forms made necessary by the classical design of the buildings is, in itself, a most interesting feature of this work.  On the Machinery and Electricity building a most attractive form of ornamentation is used along the cornice crowing the clear story.  Cog wheels with intermediate small pinions interlock around the main front and ends of the building.  The spandrels over the lower windows are bordered with miniature incandescent lamps, and the main portion of the design is formed of resistance coils surrounded by various small articles in the way of machinists' and electricians' tools.  Wherever good taste would indicate their use the various appliances peculiar to these sciences are utilized to add to the beauty of the structure.  The top of this building will be crowned by groups of statuary recently described at length in these columns, the central idea being to symbolize, by these groups, the battle of man with the forces of nature and his victory.  The entire building will be a series of yellow tones, growing more intense as they reach the top, culminating in the golden statuary which will surmount the whole.</p>
                            <p>The wealth and abundance derived from agriculture will be shown in the richness of ornamentation of the Agricultural building.  The panels above the principal columns represent a bull's head gracefully festooned on either side with garlands of corn, wheat, vegetables and fruits.  The names of those who have been patrons of agriculture or who have made notable inventions in this field of labor will be inscribed upon the panels in the frieze.  The great semi-circular entrance dome will be richly decorated in color.  On either side will be figures representing the "digger" and the "sower," taken from Millet's famous paintings.  The spandrels and arches will be relieved by festoons of corn, beets, tomatoes, radishes, potatoes, apples, pears, peaches and other products of the soil, while above them will appear the figure of Ceres, the goddess of agriculture.  Medallions of different barnyard fowls, and the nation's representative bird, the eagle, appear frequently, and the keystone of the great arch forming the main central doorway bears upon its face a monster gobbler in an attitude of defiance.</p>

                            <p>Characteristic statuary will add to the ornamentation of the Agricultural building, the great <choice><sic>ceneral</sic><corr>central</corr></choice> mass being crowned by a group representing "Prosperity," supported by "Labor" and "Industry."  On either side of this central group will be smaller groups representing the zodiac and the seasons.  The corner pavilions will be appropriately ornamented with figures typifying the favorable winds.  The color treatment of this building will be such as to produce an exquisite effect and emphasize the figure decoration.</p>
                            <p>The decoration of the Mines and Mining building is on the most elaborate order.  The use to which the building is to be devoted will be indicated by the color decoration, which will be that of the various metals, and by the statuary which will surmount the structure.  The architecture of the building is of the Roman Doric order, with a suggestion of the French renaissance, giving opportunity for elaborate decoration of the classic order, which has been fully taken advantage of by the architect.  The central pavilion will be surmounted by a group of figures of heroic size, <choice><sic>represeting</sic><corr>representing</corr></choice> gold, <choice><sic>silve, coppe and ion</sic><corr>silver, copper and iron</corr></choice> kneeling at the feet of Commerce and offering her their precious stores.  The elaborate decoration of this building will be brought into strong relief by the use of color, enhancing the beauty of the graceful embellishment.</p>

                            <p>W. E. Skinner, president of the Live Stock exchange of Fort Worth, Tex., has been appointed commissioner of the Live Stock bureau of the Department of Exhibits.</p>
                            <p>The A. C. Griffen Iron company of Jersey City, N. J., has offered the exposition management the free use of its building specialties, such as radiators, separators, traps, etc.</p>

                            <p>Colonel C. A. Lousberry of Fargo, vice president for North Dakota, writes that his state will accept and use the 500 square feet of space offered by the exposition management.  He says matters are delayed somewhat by the sickness of the governor, who is in California, and by the fact that there is no state appropriation, but he says he expects to overcome those impediments and to make a creditable showing for the state.</p>

                            <p>The contractors on the main exposition buildings are taking every advantage of the opportunity afforded by the fine weather and are pushing the work on the buildings with all possible speed.  The plasterers especially are making the best of the high temperature and are covering the outside of the buildings at a rapid rate.</p>
                            <p>A large force of plasterers is working on the Machinery and Electricity building and that beautiful structure is beginning to show its charming points.  The north wall of this building is completed and workmen removed the scaffolding this morning.  The staff is nearly all in place on the exterior of this building, and a force of staff men is working on the columns which support the galleries and roof.  The carpenter work is well advanced, but considerable delay is being caused by the non-arrival of the translucent fabric for the skylights.  The roof covering cannot be put on until this material is in place and a snowstorm with the roof in its present condition would do considerable damage.</p>
                            <p>The staff work on the Mines building is making a fine showing.  The corner pavilions and the cornice at the west end of the building are nearing completion and the plasterers are following close behind the staff men.  The north wall has been entirely covered with plaster and the scaffolding has been removed.</p>
                            <p>The Agricultural building will be in the hands of the staff men and plasterers within a few days.  Workmen are erecting the scaffolding for these gangs and the exterior of the building is ready for them.</p>
                            <p>The <choice><sic>contrator</sic><corr>contractor</corr></choice> for the Art building is making the most of the fine weather and is trying to overcome the delay in starting work caused by the failure to get lumber.  The east section of the building is in an advanced stage, the side walls being practically completed and ready for the roof.  The west section is assuming form, some of the side walls being finished and the others being well under way.</p>
                            <p>The Auditorium is rapidly nearing completion.  The last of the roof trusses has been finished and the sheathing for the roof is close behind.  The interior work has been progressing at the same time and the building will be ready for the staff men and plasterers within a few days.</p>
                            <p>The whole force of workmen on the Nebraska building has been working on the roof for several days and the large central dome is entirely covered.  The small particles of mica with which the surface of the roof covering is coated give the dome the appearance of being coated with silver and it glitters and sparkles in the sunlight with pleasing effect.</p>
                            <p>The piling for the Illinois building is completed and some of the lumber for the building is on the ground.  Work on the superstructure will be commenced within a few days.</p>
                            <p>Preparations are being made to drive the piles for the Horticulture building.  The piledriver is being set in position and the piles are being hauled to the site.  Driving will be commenced at once.</p>

                            <p>Chairman Stenberg of the Board of County Commissioners, County Clerk Redfield and Special Attorney Beckett are still in Lincoln, appearing before the supreme court in the proceedings brought to test the legality of the poor farm funding and the exposition bonds voted at the November election.</p>
                            <p>Attorney General Smyth, in speaking of the bond question, and this morning that in his opinion there could be no doubt of the legality of the funding bonds.  At the election at which they were voted they received more than the necessary majority, which fact in itself made the issue legal.  Regarding the refusal of Farson, Leach &amp; Co. of Chicago to take the bonds, the attorney general did not think that the firm could be held to a compliance of the contract, but the check of $500, deposited with the board, could be held.  This check was put up as a forfeit and also as a guaranty that the bonds would be purchased and the purchase price paid.  "Now that the firm has refused to take the bonds," added the attorney general, "if the supreme court holds that the issue is legal, there is no reason why the forfeit check should be returned."</p>
                            <p>Regarding the exposition bonds, purchased by the state for the benefit of the permanent school fund, Attorney General Smyth said that prior to making his bid, he looked up the question of legality and satisfied himself that the bonds were valid.  But one question could arise, and that would be whether the expenditure of the money would come within the strict letter of the law.  Mr. Smyth said that is was upon his suggestion that the suit to test the question of the legality of these bonds was instituted in the supreme court.  While he did not question the right of the county to issue these bonds, it was better to secure a decision of the supreme court at this time than to wait twenty years, when the bonds would become due and payable.</p>

                            <p>At 2:30 o'clock this afternoon Mr. John C. Wharton and Mrs. Ida M. Boggs, widow of the late George W. Boggs, were married at the residence of the bride, 320 North Twentieth street.  The ceremony was performed by Rev. Alexander Gilchrist, pastor of the First United Presbyterian church of this city, there being no pastor in charge of Mr. Wharton's church, the First Presbyterian, at present.  Immediately after the ceremony Mr. and Mrs. Wharton left over the Union Pacific for California, to be gone about one month.</p>
                            <p>The wedding was a very quiet one, there being no cards, no announcement and no invitations.  Those who witnessed the ceremony were Mrs. Isabella Fitzgerald, mother of Mr. Wharton, his two sons, Glenn and Gerald, Mrs. Kendall, mother of Mrs. Boggs, and Mr. Wharton's law partner, William Baird, and Mrs. Baird.</p>
                            <p>John C. Wharton is well known throughout the west as one of Omaha's ablest attorneys.  His high standing at the bar is attested by the universal esteem in which he is held.  His ability is recognized by the government to the extent that his name has been practically settled on by the president for the appointment to the place of United States attorney for Nebraska.  His bride is also well known to a large circle of friends as a woman of many fine attainments and estimable qualities.  She has not been a prominent society woman but has been active in church circles, and is well known in connection with charitable work.  The friends to whom this announcement will come as a surprise will none the less warm in their congratulations.</p>

                            <head type="main">MODELS OF THE GREAT GROUPS</head>
                            <head type="sub">SCULPTOR BOCK ILLUSTRATES HIS IDEAS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Statuary for the Machinery and Electricity Building Shown in Detail of Its Conception by the Designer.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>R. W. Bock of Chicago, the sculptor who is to make the groups of statues which will surmount the Machinery and Electricity building, arrived in Omaha this morning, bringing with him the small clay models of the several groups.  These models are on a very small scale, but they give an excellent idea of the beauty of the design and the artistic manner in which it will be carried out.</p>
                            <p>The first of these two groups, taken in the order of the sequence of ideas, is one of four figures.  The central figures are those of a man and a lion.  These two are engaged in a struggle for supremacy, the huge brute reared on his haunches, his shaggy head towering above the head of the man and his right paw raised to administer a death blow to his foe.  The man is putting forth all his strength to overcome the brute and tie him with a rope.  A second man is struggling to his feet after suffering defeat at the hands of the lion and is lending all possible assistance to his brother by aiding him in tying the lion.  A dead ram at the feet of the lion typifies the victory of brute force over its kind.  The entire group is typical of the struggle of primitive man with untamed brute force.</p>
                            <p>The second group consists of five figures, representing the intermediate stage, where man, endowed with intelligence, conquers brute force (symbolized as in the other group by the lion), assisted by the hound.  The brute is simply subjected, but man is able to protect his family, the mother and child seen resting beneath the outstretched shield of the father, while the lion is under his foot.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SHOWS MAN'S VICTORY.</head>
                            <p>The principal group is a large one and will surmount the grand central portion of the building, the other groups being mounted on the corner pavilions.  This central group shows brute force, symbolized by five lions harnessed to a chariot and driven, in complete subjection, by man, symbolized by a Norse king who carries the magic hammer of Siegfried, by means of which the mechanical wonders of the age are produced.  At either side of the chariot are standard bearers, carrying symbols of machinery and electricity.</p>
                            <p>In addition to these groups American eagles, with wings outstretched, will occupy intermediate positions along the main front of the building.  The figures modeled by Mr. Bock show great force and vigor in their general appearance and in the manner in which the details are carried out.  Life and action are plainly indicated in all of them, the struggle of the man with the lion being especially strong.  The expression on the face of the lion indicates ferocity and force and the attitude of the man is indicative of a struggle to the death.  The muscles of both man and brute stand out as in life.</p>
                            <p>These groups will all be of heroic size.  The principal group, when placed on the building, will be twenty-four feet across the front, twenty feet from front to rear and sixteen feet high, the central figure being twelve feet high.  The figures in the other groups will be twelve feet in height.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bock brought his figures to Omaha for the inspection of the exposition officials and came himself to make a personal examination of the Machinery and Electricity building and the exact location of the groups.  He visited the grounds this morning for this purpose.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bock stated that he would return to Chicago at once and would there make another set of models on a scale of about one-fifth of the full size.  As soon as these are completed he will come to Omaha and will establish a workshop on or near the exposition grounds and will at once commence the work of making the figures which will go on the buildings.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Judge Neville Sets Himself About an Onerous Task.</head>
                            <p>Judge William Neville of North Platte, vice president of the exposition for Nebraska and chairman of the Nebraska Exposition commission, has commenced the difficult task assigned to him, in common with the vice president of each state in the transmississippi region, viz: selecting the two most beautiful women in the state whose photographs are to be used in making a composite picture of a woman's head to be used as a model for one side of the souvenir medal of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Nebraska's vice president has taken advantage of modern inventions in making his selection and is endeavoring to keep clear of the dangers which beset the path in such an undertaking.  He requests that photographs coming within the requirements be sent to him at North Platte by mail within the next ten or twelve days.  The names and the addresses of the subject of each picture should also be sent so that communication may be had with the parties in case any correction should be necessary in the photograph or for any other good reason.</p>
                            <p>The requirements of this contest are few and there is no doubt the mails to North Platte from all sections of the state will soon show a heavy increase as the pictures of the thousands of beautiful women in Nebraska are sent to the vice president for selection of the most beautiful.  The task is making the selection will be an enormous one, and for that reason Judge Neville asks that the pictures be sent as soon as possible so that he may have plenty of time to decide the delicate and trying questions involved.</p>
                            <p>The conditions laid down by Manager Lindsey of the Department of Ways and Means, who has requested the state vice presidents to send him the photographs after the selections are made, are these: The picture must be of cabinet size and must show the full profile view of head and shoulders of the subject.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Matters of Importance to Come Up for Consideration.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi auxiliary will hold a meeting in the Grand hotel tomorrow evening.  It will be the first meeting since the holidays, and as there are a number of matters to come up for consideration the gathering promises to be of unusual interest.</p>
                            <p>Since the committee undertook the work of erecting the gigantic tepee on the exposition grounds for the purpose of making a distinctive exhibit of Pottawattamie county resources there has been developed some opposition on the part of the state commissioners, who seem to feel that there is danger of the Council Bluffs enterprise assuming a character somewhat out of proportion to the exhibit the state will make, and the committee has received several rather positive hints that it might be better for the interests of the state and the Iowa exhibit if the largest county in the state would merge its exhibit into that of the state.  Some missionary work has been done among the members of the association in this respect, and they have been inclined to look with favor upon the plan proposing a consolidation.  The majority of the members, however, are not so inclined, and are willing to undertake the responsibilities of the large independent enterprise for the benefit it will confer upon the city and the county.  There may be same discussion of the matter at the meeting tomorrow evening.</p>
                            <p>Another important thing to be considered is the method to be employed to dispose of the 5,000 handsome exposition buttons that have been received and are now in possession of the secretary and the button committee.  These buttons are to be sold for $1 each and the proceeds used toward defraying the cost of the city's exhibit.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SENATE PASSES THE ALLEN BILL</head>
                            <head type="sub">Appropriation of $100,000 to Defray the Expense of a Magnificent Ethnological Collection at the Omaha Exposition.</head>
                            <p>The action of the United State senate this morning in passing Senator Allen's bill to appropriate $45,000 for an Indian exhibit by the general government was the cause of great rejoicing on the part of the exposition management.  While the passage of the bill by the senate is not a positive indication that the house will also pass it, there is a general feeling that the stamp of approval of the measure at the hands of the senate will exert a powerful influence on the house and do much to assure the final passage of the act.</p>
                            <p>If this bill becomes a law it will make possible the grandest and most instructive ethnological exhibit ever attempted.  The purpose of the bill is to enable the proper departments of the federal government to make an exhibit showing the development of the American Indian, the exhibition to be made at Omaha during the coming year.  The exposition management has been bringing every influence to bear to have the government undertake this work, as no private management could possibly carry it out.  The Indian bureau has taken the matter up and the officers of this bureau have shown a strong desire to do anything that could contribute in any way to the success of this movement.</p>
                            <p>During a recent trip to Washington Manager Rosewater devoted considerable time to visiting the departments having an interest in such an undertaking and succeeded in convincing officers of the importance of the project from a scientific standpoint.  He also interested a number of the members of the senate and house in the plan and received assurances of support which seemed to indicate the ultimate success of the movement.  Mr. Rosewater has been an enthusiastic advocate of the Indian exhibit idea since the inception of the exposition, and has lost no opportunity to emphasize the necessity of having such an exhibit in connection with an exposition of the region which is still regarded as the home of the red man and the buffalo.  He expressed gratification at the action of the senate and thought the bill would become a law in due time.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles is also greatly pleased at the news of the senate's action.  He has been very enthusiastic in his support of the idea and has taken great pains to arouse interest in the quarters where the most good could result.  He said that such an exhibit would add to the exposition in a degree that could scarcely be estimated and would be a very strong card in inducing people to come here from the east to witness the last gathering of Indians which the world would ever see.</p>

                            <p>At the meeting of the executive committee of the exposition yesterday Manager Bruce was authorized to deviate from the established rule which requires all exhibits to be installed in the main buildings erected by the exposition, and allow states outside of the transmississippi region and foreign governments to erect buildings on the grounds in which to install collective exhibits.</p>
                            <p>The flood of applications for space coming from foreign exhibitors has made it necessary to provide increased accommodations for this class of exhibitors.  The Liberal Arts building has been regarded as the natural location for the foreign section and the executive committee decided yesterday to put a wide and roomy gallery in this building in order to accommodate this class of exhibits.</p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall was authorized to enter into a contract with Sculptor Metler of Omaha for the statuary which will adorn the Administration building.  The models for the groups and single figures for this building have been finished for some time.  In the center of the south front of the building a group of three figures will be mounted just above the main cornice on a pedestal prepared for it.  This group will symbolize "Administration" and will comprise a central figure sitting on a throne, holding a scepter and assuming the attitude of command.  At either side a smaller figure will sit at the feet of the first named, holding a scroll.  These figures will be about twelve feet in height.  On each of the corner pavilions of this building will be four sitting figures, one at each corner of the pavilion.  Above the arch on the south side of the building will be two spandrels, each bearing the figure of a woman.  Sculptor Metler has been in Omaha since last summer and has made a number of busts of Omaha people, while waiting for action on his exposition figures.  He will at once take up the <unclear/></p>
                            <p>Manager Kirkendall will advertise at once for bids for painting the interior of the Manufactures building, authority having been granted him for such action.</p>
                            <p>Manager Reed was authorized to enter into a contract with the parties who have been in the city for several days negotiating for a concession for the mechanical device called "rolling the roll."</p>

                            <p>Commercial Agent Halstead has returned from New Jersey, where he has been for several weeks, engaged in stirring up interest in the exposition.  He reports that the New Jersey Exposition commission is composed of lively, hustling, enterprising business people, who are taking great interest in seeing that the manufacturing interests of their state are properly represented.  The chairman of the commission, Colonel Robert Mitchell Floyd, Mr. Halstead says, is the right man in the right place and is accomplishing a great deal of good.  He is intensely enthusiastic regarding the exposition and spends his entire time, without remuneration, in traveling about from one manufacturing district to another, arousing the people to the importance of making a good exhibit.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the applications already sent in, Mr. Halstead brought with him an application by the Whitehead &amp; Hoag company of Newark, N. J., for 400 feet of space in which they propose to install an operative exhibit of buttons, badges, flags and banners, employing twelve men for the purpose.</p>

He says they will make an interesting exhibit in the geological section, as showing traces of the glacier in that portion of Iowa.  He offers to send them to the department for disposition.  They will be received.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The Missouri commissioners are losing no time.  The following account taken from yesterday's Globe-Democrat of a meeting held in St. Louis on <choice><sic>Wednesdnay</sic><corr>Wednesday</corr></choice> shows with what energy the body is working:</p>
                            <p>The Missouri commission for the Transmississippi and <choice><sic>Internation</sic><corr>International</corr></choice> Exposition, which was recently appointed by Governor Stephens, met yesterday in the grand parlor at the Southern hotel at the request of the governor.  There were thirty-three of the forty-three gentlemen appointed upon the commission present.  They were: C. D. McLure, H. A. Blossom, F. E. Marshall, C. H. Spencer, C. H. Sampson, W. H. Phelps, Charles A. Lemp, P. J. Toomey of St. Louis; Phil E. Mullins, G. W. Walden, W. W. Morgan, John F. Richards, Frank G. Graham of Kansas City; E. T. Abbott, F. D. Maxwell of St. Joseph; John O'Day, Jerre Cravens, G. A. Atwood of Springfield; Major C. O. Harrington, C. A. Emery of Carthage; John H. Taylor, Joplin; G. M. Manker, Webb City; J. N. Ballard, Montrose; W. H. Allen, Clinton; Dr. R. H. Jesse, John R. Rippey of Columbia; Henry W. Ewing, M. V. Carroll of Jefferson City; J. W. Baldwin, Judge J. N. Dalby of Sedalia; C. C. Davidson, El Dorado Springs; J. H. Berkshire, Winona; J. D. Tolson, Fayette; A. H. Danforth, Charleston.</p>
                            <p>The meeting was called to order by Colonel W. H. Phelps of St. Louis and a temporary organization was effected at once by the appointment of Clark H. Sampson temporary chairman and M. V. Carroll temporary secretary.</p>
                            <p>R. W. Richardson, the representative in St. Louis of the management of the Omaha exposition was invited to address the commission.  In his talk Mr. Richardson set before the meeting the object of the exposition.  While it was to be international in its character, its chief object was to bring before the world the products and resources of the west, northwest and southwest.  This would be true from the location of the exposition, just as the Nashville and Atlanta expositions were essentially southern.  The management of the exposition looked to the western states for the strongest support.  While this was true, it was also true that that exposition would not discriminate against anybody, from whatever section he might come.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Richardson read a letter from Gurdon W. Wattles, president of the exposition, inviting the Missouri commission to visit Omaha in a body and gather what inspiration they could from an inspection of the grounds of the exposition and by conferring with the management there.  This invitation was formally accepted later by the commission, as was also the courtesy of the Burlington route for the trip, extended by R. H. Todd.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PERMANENT ORGANIZATION.</head>
                            <p>A committee on permanent organization, consisting of John O'Day, C. C. Davidson, Henry W. Ewing, F. W. Maxwell, J. W. Ballard, C. A. Emry, Phil E. Mullins and H. A. Blossom, was appointed and then the commission adjourned until 2 p. m.</p>
                            <p>At the afternoon session the committee on permanent organization reported in favor of Clark H. Sampson, president; M. V. Carroll, secretary; R. M. Walden, first vice president; L. C. Burnes, second vice president; G. A. Atwood, third vice president and an executive council composed of John O'Day, M. V. Carroll J. W. Baldwin, W. H. Allen, Henry W. Ewing, John H. Taylor, Phil E. Mullins, F. W. Maxwell, J. D. Tolson, J. H. Berkshire, W. H. Phelps, H. A. Blossom and C. H. Spencer  The report was adopted unanimously.</p>
                            <p>The president was empowered to appoint a finance committee, to be composed of at least one from each congressional district.  This committee will be supposed to solicit funds for the work to be undertaken.</p>
                            <p>A committee on transportation was appointed, consisting of John O'Day, W. H. Phelps and F. G. Graham.</p>
                            <p>The president was instructed to appoint the following committees: On agriculture and live stock, on horticulture, on mines and mining and on manufacturing.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Richardson requested a statement of the purpose of the commission and it was given by Chairman Simpson, who said that the commission would undertake to secure sufficient funds to erect a creditable building for the state at the exposition, and make a display of the state's products and resources in keeping with the state's position and second to the exhibit of no other state.  This statement of the commission's purpose was endorsed by members.</p>
                            <p>The meeting adjourned to meet at Kansas City on the call of the president.  This meeting will be soon, as the president stated that he thought the visit to Omaha should be made at once.  The plan which was practically agreed upon yesterday was to meet soon in Kansas City, spend one day there and try to turn the $25,000 raised by Kansas City for its building at the exposition into the fund of the state commission and go from Kansas City to St. Joseph and from there to Omaha.</p>
                            <p>After the commission had adjourned the executive committee met and organized with John O'Day chairman, M. V. Carroll secretary and F. E. Marshal treasurer.  Mr. Sampson, Secretary Carroll and Mr. Blossom were authorized to employ help, have stationery printed and incur such expenses as should be necessary.</p>
                            <p>It was decided, on motion, that no money should be paid out except by order of the executive committee.  President Sampson will probably announce the standing committees of the commission today.</p>

                            <p>The citizens of Laramie county, Wyoming, held a mass meeting in Cheyenne Monday night of this week and gave the exposition enthusiastic endorsement.  Speeches were made by Governor Richards, Prof. Frank Graves, president of the Wyoming State university and vice president of the exposition for that state, State Engineer Elwood Mead, ex-Senator J. M. Carey and other prominent citizens.  It was decided that Laramie county should have an exhibit at the exposition regardless of what the other counties in the state do in the matter, and a county executive committee of five members was appointed to commence at once the work of raising the necessary money by private subscriptions and to prepare and install a suitable exhibit.</p>
                            <p>A resolution was adopted which outlines a plan for the creation of a state commission.  The residents of each county are requested to hold a mass meeting and appoint committees to raise funds for making a state exhibit.  It is recommended that $7,500 be raised by this means, the amount being apportioned among the counties of the state according to their population, and it is suggested that a certificate be given each subscriber for the amount contributed and that the legislature be asked to refund to each the amount thus paid.  When a majority of the counties shall have raised their proportion of the amount it is provided that the chairmen of the county committees shall constitute the state commission to collect and install the state exhibit.</p>
                            <p>This resolution will be sent to the other counties in the state with the request that they take immediate action in the matter.</p>

                            <p>YORK, Neb., Jan. 6.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;The January number of the Union Worker, the organ of the Nebraska Woman's Christian Temperance union, which is to be issued tomorrow, announces that this organization will make a vigorous effort to establish headquarters at the Transmississippi Exposition.  The various state organizations of the transmississippi region will be asked to contribute funds for the promotion of the plan.  The vice president of this state has been authorized to go to Omaha to investigate the cost of such a move and to select a location.  There is a movement on foot among the national organization for the holding of a temperance congress at Omaha during the exposition, which promises to meet with great favor with the Woman's Christian Temperance union of Nebraska and the western states.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The bill for the assembling of representatives of Indian tribes at Omaha from June to November of this year passed the senate this afternoon.  <choice><sic>he</sic><corr>The</corr></choice> bill was amended in a number of particulars, notably in the amount of the appropriation, the same being placed at $45,000.  The title of the bill was also changed.  The exhibit is placed under the direct charge of the secretary of the interior, instead of the commissioner of Indian affairs, as originally provided.  Senators Allen and Thurston, assisted by Senator Allison, were instrumental in securing the passage of the measure.</p>
                            <p>The passage of the bill was accomplished without friction, Senator Allison, chairman of the committee on appropriations, taking occasion to amend the bill considerably, but in a very small degree changing the original design of the measure.  The title was amended to provide for the assembling of different representatives of the Indian tribes of the United States and directing the secretary of the interior "to cause to be assembled at the city of Omaha at such time and for such period as he may designate between the first day of June and November, in 1898, representatives of the Indian tribes as part of the Transmississippi and International Exposition."</p>
                            <p>The amount of money which the bill appropriates is considered ample for the needs of the secretary, as the government will have to subsist the Indians at Omaha just the same as it does on reservations, the only material cost being that of transportation.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SENATORS COMMEND THE BILL.</head>
                            <p>Senators when seen today as to the merits of the bill, unhesitatingly pronounced it one of the greatest features ever devised for an exposition.  On all sides were heard laudatory remarks, and both senators from Nebraska were congratulated by their colleagues in giving the country something new and at the same time something that would prove of incalculable benefit to white people, as well as to the red men.</p>
                            <p>Congressman Mercer, when informed that this bill had passed the senate, said he would at once begin an active campaign in getting the measure reported favorably by the committee of Indian affairs in the house, and would then put forth his best efforts in securing its passage.  The known disposition of the leaders of the house to hold appropriations down to the receipts of the government may have some bearing on the bill's fate, but the Nebraska delegation, with Mercer at its head, will at once commence actively canvassing among republicans and democrats on the committee to secure a favorable report.</p>
                            <p>Senator Thurston said: "I very much want to see the bill become a law.  It would give to the exposition a character and standing that would advertise it far and wide and bring Nebraska thousands who might otherwise remain away.  Now that the bill has passed the senate, it gives it strong standing with the appropriations committee and should the house delegation fail to get the bill considered, I believe we can put an appropriation on the Indian bill and with good staying qualities on the part of the senate may be able to squeeze it through.  We will work to that end, anyhow."</p>

                            <p>The arrangement for an exhibit by the bureau of fiber investigation of the Department of Agriculture are being consummated and the indications are very favorable for one of the most interesting exhibits in this line ever attempted.  This display will be entirely independent of the exhibit to be made by the other branches of the government in the Government building and will be made in the Agriculture building, where 1,000 square feet of space has been set aside for the purpose.  The display will be under the direct charge of Prof. Charles Richards Dodge, the government officer in charge of these investigations.  A correspondence has been carried on for some time between Prof. Dodge and President Wattles regarding this matter and a recent letter from the former states that the details are being worked out in such a manner that a most successful exhibit is assured.  The writer states that the foreign makers of fiber machinery have manifested an unusual interest in the proposed exhibit, and some who have heretofore declined to take any part in the exhibits at other points have been most active in making inquiry and asking for space in which to <choice><sic>instal</sic><corr>install</corr></choice> their machines.  American inventors have also taken hold of the matter and will be on hand with a good line of practical inventions for manipulating the fiber.  The collection of fibers and the manufactured products which are in the possession of the government bureau will form one feature of the exhibit, which will illustrate every known fiber which is suitable for use in making cloth or any of the numerous other uses to which this material may be put.</p>
                            <p>Among other attractive features of this exhibit will be a test, under the direct supervision of the government, of the capacity and practical value of the machines manufactured by different makes, with a view of guiding prospective manufacturers in the selection of machines for their plants.</p>
                            <p>The purpose of the bureau of fiber investigation is to encourage the cultivation of fiber plants in this country and the manufacture of fiber into cloth, rope and the many other forms for which it is peculiarly applicable.  For this reason the proposed exhibit will have a peculiar interest in this section, as the exhibit will not only comprehend the manufacture of the finished product, but will include sections showing the various kinds of plants and the methods of cultivation, soil, moisture and other requirements.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Kuhn of the Northwestern Proposes to Omaha Freight Men the Feasibility of Uniting on This Point.</head>
                            <p>There will be a meeting of the freight representatives of all the lines entering Omaha on Monday morning next to consider the advisability of establishing a joint agency for all the railroads at the exposition grounds to look after the handling of <choice><sic>exhibts</sic><corr>exhibits</corr></choice> and other freight between the various freight depots and the grounds of the exposition.  The different lines to their own terminals and within the grounds the freight will be handled by the exposition management under the direction of Manager Babcock of the Department of Transportation.</p>
                            <p>The proposition to establish a joint agency for all the lines to handle the freight between the different terminals and the exposition grounds was broached by General Agent John A. Kuhn of the Northwestern in a letter to the other railroads.  Conversation with the freight men of other lines developed general commendation of the scheme and there is no doubt but that Monday's conference will result in an agreement for the object desired.  Mr. Kuhn's self-explanatory letter is as follows:</p>
                            <p>I have been called upon by our company to prepare a circular of instructions to govern our exhibits for the Transmississippi and International Exposition, particularly less than carload shipments.</p>
                            <p>I have called on Manager <choice><sic>abcock</sic><corr>Babcock</corr></choice> and am advised by him that he has prepared a schedule of rates to govern on articles of exhibits after reaching the exposition grounds, but there is no provision made for transferring the goods between the depots of the several lines and the exposition grounds.  Furthermore, it is suggested that it would be necessary to appoint a joint agency to take charge of traffic after arrival at the grounds, similar to the arrangement made at Chicago during the World's Columbian exposition, and with a view of obtaining uniform action on the subject I would ask of it would be convenient to attend a meeting to discuss the above subject, to be held in <choice><sic>anager</sic><corr>Manager</corr></choice> Babcock's office on Monday, January 10, at 10 o'clock a. m.  It is also suggested that the local agents of the different lines be invited to attend the conference.</p>

                            <p>The arrangements for an exhibit by the bureau of fiber investigation of the Department of Agriculture are being consummated and the indications are very favorable for one of the most interesting exhibits in this line ever attempted.  This display will be entirely independent of the exhibit to be made by the other branches of government in the Government building and will be made in the Agriculture building, where 1,000 square feet of space has been set aside for the purpose.  The display will be under the direct charge of Prof. Charles Richards Dodge, the government officer in charge of these investigations.  A correspondence has been carried on for some time between Prof. Dodge and President Wattles regarding this matter and a recent letter from the former states that the details are being worked out in such a manner that a most successful exhibit is assured.  The writer states that the foreign makers of fiber machinery have manifested an unusual interest in the proposed exhibit, and some who have heretofore declined to take any part in the exhibits at other points have been most active in making inquiry and asking for space in which to instal their machines.  American inventors have also taken hold of the matter and will be on hand with a good line of practical inventions for manipulating the fiber.  The collection of fibers and the manufactured products which are in the possession of the government bureau will form one feature of the exhibit, which will illustrate every known fiber which is suitable for use in making cloth of any of the numerous other uses to which this material may be put.</p>
                            <p>Among other attractive features of this exhibit will be a test, under the direct supervision of the government, of the capacity and practical value of the machines manufactured by different makers, with a view of guiding prospective manufacturers in the selection of machines for their plants.</p>
                            <p>The purpose of the bureau of fiber investigation is to encourage the cultivation of fiber plants in this country and the manufacture of fiber into cloth, rope and the many other forms for which it is peculiarly applicable.  For this reason the proposed exhibit will have a peculiar interest in this section, as the exhibit will not only comprehend the manufacture of the finished product, but will include sections showing the various kinds of plants and the methods of cultivation, soil, moisture and other requirements.</p>

                            <p>The roof of the Nebraska building is completed with the exception of the covering of the upper part of the small corner domes.  The roofs of these are hemispherical and will be covered with canvas painted the same shade as the rest of the roof.  On account of their shape it will not be practical to use the elaterite roofing with which the other parts of the roof are covered.</p>
                            <p>Kimball Bros. of Lincoln, the contractors who will make the staff covering for the Nebraska building, have arrived with a force of men and commenced work yesterday morning making the models for the staff decoration.

                            <head type="sub">PEACEABLY OR FORCIBLY, IT MUST COME</head>
                            <head type="sub">Committee Appointed to Get the Water Company's Proposal, After Which the Course of Action Will Be Adopted.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The Board of Directors of the exposition took a turn at the water question at its regular meeting yesterday afternoon and appointed a committee to wait on the officials of the water company and learn what they will do toward supplying the exposition with the water which is absolutely necessary to its success.  This committee will report to an adjourned meeting of the board to be held for that purpose at 4 o'clock Tuesday afternoon.  According to several vigorous expressions of opinion at the meeting of yesterday prompt and decisive action to compel the water company to supply the necessary water will be taken in case the mission of the special committee is unsuccessful.</p>
                            <p>The board also took up the matter of providing accommodations for the thousands of visitors who will be in Omaha during the coming summer and fall, and a bureau to be known as the Bureau of Public Comfort was created and placed under the direction of the Department of Ways and Means.  This bureau will at once take up the work of investigating the available accommodations and devising plans for providing for any deficiency.  The personnel of this bureau was not determined, the appointment until he had consulted with the directors to find men who would devote the necessary time to the work.</p>
                            <p>The meeting was convened about 3:30 p. m. with a bare majority of the directors present.</p>
                            <p>The following document, to which was attached a string of signatures fully fifteen feet in length, was presented to the meeting:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, It has been stated by President Wattles of the Board of Managers of the Transmississippi Exposition that the Agricultural society of the state of California desires to build an immense wine vat on the exposition grounds with a capacity of 100,000 gallons, which it will keep filled and every visitor to the exposition will be privileged to drink at will, without money or price; therefore</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That we, residents of Nebraska, do most earnestly protest against the making of such concession by the Transmississippi commission, believing that the permitting of such proposed exhibit of wine and its free use as a beverage by all who care to drink it, regardless of sex or age, must work untold injury to the morality of the state and the creating of the appetite for strong drink in our young, will be a curse to our people and in every way detrimental to the best interests of our commonwealth.</p>
                            <p>This resolution was unanimously adopted by the Second district Woman's Christian Temperance union at its annual convention, August 24, 1897.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles stated that the only possible foundation that existed for the statements contained in the resolution was the fact that some of the members of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce had made inquiry as to space charge and other items of expense for the display of a "Niagara in Wine," but no further steps had been taken, and there seemed little probability that anything would be done.</p>
                            <p>The document was placed on file.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">REPORTS FROM MANAGERS.</head>
                            <p>Reports from the various departments were called for and Manager Lindsey of the Department of Ways and Means asked that he be granted further time in which to publish the names of delinquent subscribers to exposition stock, as he was not ready to make the publication.  The time was extended to February 15.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater submitted a written annual report of the Press Bureau of the Department of Publicity and Promotion, which he said showed that the bureau had distributed 268,412 documents of various kinds and had secured approximately 4,900,000 words of free advertising in papers of every class in all parts of the country.  Several of the most important publications in the country are preparing for articles which will appear in the near future.</p>
                            <p>Regarding the promotion feature of his department Mr. Rosewater said he had not had time to prepare a written report, but he reviewed the situation briefly, telling of the work that is being done.  About thirty states are being promoted and the prospect for success is flattering.  The western states are beginning to recognize the importance of the exposition to them and the eastern states are taking a great interest.  He predicts that three-fourths of the states in the union, as well as a number of the principal foreign countries, will be represented.  In this connection Mr. Rosewater said he was convinced that it will be necessary to raise more money and erect other and larger buildings to accommodate the great number of exhibits which will be received.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="188" xml:id="TMISB03-188"/>
                            
                            <p>Manager Bruce of the Department of Exhibits submitted a written report detailing the work which has been done by the several bureaus in his department.</p>
                            <p>Manager Babcock said he had no report to make for the Transportation department further than to say that progress was being made with the railroads and matters were in a satisfactory state.</p>
                            <p>Manager Lindsey brought up the question of accommodation for the many visitors who will come to Omaha during the exposition, saying the matter should be agitated, as the people are coming ans something must be done.</p>
                            <p>Dudley Smith, a member of the special joint committee appointed by the Commercial club, Woman's club, Exposition association and Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben, to take charge of this matter, was asked to state what had been done.  He told about the meetings which have been held by the committee and the investigations which have been made to form a basis for further work.  He said the sense of the committee seemed to be that the exposition directory should take the initiative.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater said this question of taking care of the great number of people who will visit the exposition was one of the most important matters with which the people must grapple.  He said a systematic canvass of this city should be made and a careful estimate made of what is necessary to be done.  The members of the executive committee already had all they could possibly attend to, and a committee should be appointed from the board which could give several weeks to the matter.</p>
                            <p>Dudley Smith moved the appointment of a committee of five, to be known as the Bureau of Public Comfort, and to be under the direction of the Ways and Means department.  This was adopted, and President Wattles announced that he would appoint the committee after consulting with directors and finding five men who would agree to serve.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WATER QUESTION TAKEN UP.</head>
                            <p>The meeting waited nearly an hour for Manager Kirkendall to make a report on the water works question, but as he did not appear, it was suggested that a matter of such importance should be taken up without ceremony and discussed by the board.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater was called upon to state the present status of the exposition and the water question.  He said he hesitated somewhat to lead the discussion, as he had been falsely charged with having a selfish interest in the affairs of the water company.  He presented the serious phase of the matter briefly.  He explained that water was the all-important consideration and all that the executive committee asks of the board of directors is that water be supplied.  The committee does not ask that the franchise of the water company be extended or that any other specific steps be taken, but all it asks is water.  A fire would make it absolutely impossible to hold the exposition, and the committee appeals to the directors to see that water is furnished in order that the money invested be not entirely lost.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lyman said it looked as though the town was being held up by the water company in order to secure certain concessions.  He said it had been stated at a meeting held at the city hall that the exposition management was in collusion with the water company to secure an extension of its franchise.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles said he looked at the water question simply as a business proposition.  He believed that the only logical solution of the question is the securing of water from the water company.  There are many reasons why it is not advisable to procure water from any other source that seems available, as the charge might be made that the water is impure and unfit for use.  He outlined the position of the water company to the effect that it has not the capacity to supply the necessary water.  The president said he was opposed to the purchase of the water company's plant and believed that the best solution of the question would be to make the best bargain that can be made which will secure the water, whether that would involve extending the franchise or not.  He said he had a petition, signed by all but eight members of the board of directors, asking the city council to do the only thing the exposition management had ever asked it to do.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WHAT WEBSTER SAID.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Kilpatrick asked Mr. Webster to repeat the statements he had made to the meeting in the city hall regarding the statements of the officers of the water company during the recent suit in the federal court, which he said disproved the statements now made by the water company representatives.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Webster said the engineer in charge of the Florence pumping station, Captain Reynolds, had testified that the average daily consumption of Omaha, South Omaha and East Omaha is 14,000,000 gallons and that the engines have pumped 26,000,000 gallons into the mains per day.  Mr. Webster says that this shows that the capacity is about double the present consumption.  In addition to this, Mr. Webster said, Superintendent Hunt had testified that the Burt street pumping station has a capacity  of 8,000,000 gallons and the engines there are kept constantly ready for use in case of accident at the Florence station.  He contended that this disposes of the claim that the capacity of the plant is not sufficient to supply the exposition.</p>
                            <p>In reply to questions from other directors Mr. Webster said he believes the water company can be compelled by the courts to furnish the water required by the exposition the same as it can be compelled to supply a private consumer.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kountze asked if the company is not compelled by its franchise to supply the water required by the citizens of Omaha without having any claim for further privileges.  Mr. Webster replied in the affirmative.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lindsey asked how much time would be required to get a mandamus in operation.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Webster said that would depend on the judge granting the order.  He could order the water company to supply the water and no supersedas would be taken, so that the company would be compelled to furnish the water pending a hearing of the case.  Mr. Webster then asked President Wattles whether the water company had told him before or after the suit brought by the city had been decided that it had not the capacity to supply the exposition.  The president was not positive, but said he felt certain that the statement had been made both before and after the decision.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WHAT THE COMPANY CAN DO.</head>
                            <p>Mr. Montgomery said he is satisfied that the company has all the capacity required to furnish the exposition, but he is in doubt whether the city should buy the plant when the franchise expires or five years from that time.  He denied the charge that he prepared the ordinance now pending in the council, but says he is not sure but that he favors it.  He charges that the water company is simply taking advantage of the situation and trying to secure concessions and declares that steps should be taken to compel the water company to supply the exposition.  He reiterated a statement made by Mr. Webster that the water company has no right to use the mains in the streets of Omaha to supply 4,000,000 gallons of water per day to South Omaha and a large amount to East Omaha until the citizens of Omaha have all the water they require.  Mr. Montgomery advised that a resolution be passed declaring that the exposition must have water and that the water company must furnish it, and following this up by an energetic effort to compel the company to do so.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kountze moved the appointment of a committee of five to interview the water company officials and learn what they will do and report to an adjourned meeting, so some energetic action may be taken.  He favors asking the company to make a connection with the mains and asking the city council to order the necessary hydrants located on the exposition grounds.  If this should not prove successful he favored extreme measures.</p>
                            <p>The motion was adopted and the president appointed as the committee Directors Kountze, Kirkendall, Kimball, Montgomery and Carpenter.</p>
                            <p>The board then adjourned until 4 p. m. next Tuesday.</p>

The visitors were taken in carriages to the Millard hotel, where Manager Kirkendall joined the party, and after a wait of a few moments the carriages were re-entered and a trip made to the exposition grounds via Sherman avenue.  Entering the gate at the south side of the main court a circuit of the Kountze tract was made, the visitors expressing great pleasure at the substantial evidences on every side of the magnitude of the enterprise.  The beauty of the buildings was commented upon in a manner flattering to the promoters of the exposition, and visitors confessed that they were surprised at the large scale on which the preparations were being made.</p>
                            <p>At the Mines building the party alighted and entered the staff shop, where the visitors manifested considerable interest in the manufacture of the marble-like coating for the buildings.  The bluff tract was also visited and the beauty of the location admired.  Active work was in progress on the Nebraska and Illinois state buildings and on the Horticulture building.</p>
                            <p>After looking over the grounds the party returned to the hotel, where the visitors were entertained at luncheon by the executive committee, while the object of the visit of the Wyoming delegation was discussed and an understanding reached regarding the exhibits to be made by the state.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GOVERNOR RICHARDS' IDEA.</head>
                            <p>Previous to the meeting with the executive committee Governor Richards discussed the situation in the rotunda of the Millard.</p>
                            <p>"Our people want to make a state exhibit," said the governor, "and we have made such arrangements as are possible in order to do so.  We are here now to learn just what is expected of us so that we may know whether we will be able to comply with the conditions.  Our legislature failed to make any appropriation for an exhibit, and we are compelled to rely upon private contributions.  After discussing the matter among ourselves we hit upon the only plan that seems practicable and that is to have each county in the state contribute its proportion of $7,500, the apportionment being based on the taxable valuation of the property in each county.</p>
                            <p>"The people of Laramie county, in which Cheyenne is situated, took the initiative in the matter and has asked the other counties to do their share.  I do not think there is any question but that this amount will be raised without any difficulty.  Laramie county's proportion of this amount was about $1,300 and this amount was raised in less than two hours Thursday afternoon of this week.  The money is being raised with the understanding that the legislature is to be asked to refund it, but whether that will be done remains to be seen.</p>
                            <p>"The 7,500 we will raise," continued the governor, "will be barely sufficient to pay for installing the exhibit and taking care of it during the exposition.  We will be obliged to depend upon private enterprise to contribute the material constituting the exhibit, but I do not have any fears on that score.  The state has no collective to speak of, although we have a large quantity of agricultural material which was left from the exhibit made at Chicago.  This consists of grain in sealed glass jars, grasses and similar material.  This can be utilized and the balance of the exhibit will be made up of articles illustrating our other resources.  We will be somewhat hampered in making an agricultural display by the fact that we made no collection of materials grown last year, and can only augment the Chicago collection by such material as grows between now and June.  We will have a good exhibit of our other resources, however.  These will include specimens from our soda beds, oils, stone of various kinds, ores and numerous materials.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WILL HELP BUILD THE ARCH.</head>
                            <p>"We have a variety of building stone, and that reminds me of the request of Governor Holcomb for stone for the Arch of States you are going to build on the exposition grounds.  As soon as I received his letter I made it public and have requested the numerous quarries in our state to supply me with samples of their stone and I expect these will be ready within a very few days.  Wyoming will contribute to her quota of stone to the arch and we have some fine varieties from which your people may select.  I think that idea is a good one and I believe it will prove very popular among the states in this section.</p>
                            <p>"I am glad I was asked to supply stone for the arch instead of being asked to pick out our two prettiest women," remarked the governor, jokingly.  "That is quite an original idea for a medal, but it means trouble for the man in Wyoming who is called on to pass on the beauty of our women.  We have so many that can be properly classed under that heading that it is no easy matter to select the two prettiest, and I am glad Prof. Graves was assigned to that job instead of having to do it myself.  We have the women, though, and if the professor ever succeeds in passing the ordeal we will do our share in that direction as well as in every other where we are called upon."</p>
                            <p>State Engineer Mead will probably have direct charge of Wyoming's exhibit, he having acted in that capacity during the World's fair, having charge of the collection and installation of the state's exhibit.  He has taken a prominent part in arousing interest in the matter of state representation and Governor Richards stated that his experience in that line makes him a most valuable man in the present emergency.</p>
                            <p>Prof. Graves is president of the Wyoming State university and is also vice president for the exposition for that state.  He has taken an active interest in arousing the people of that section to the necessity of having an exhibit at the exposition.</p>

                            <p>After the luncheon with the executive committee the Wyoming committee had a lengthy conference with Manager Bruce of the Department of Exhibits, during which the various phases of the situation were carefully canvassed and a complete understanding reached which proved entirely satisfactory to all concerned.  The visitors expressed themselves as more than pleased with the treatment accorded them by the exposition management.  They will leave for Wyoming this afternoon, and say that the report they will make to their constituents will increase the already intense interest the people of Wyoming have in the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Letters from Eminent Western Educators Sufficiently Warm to Warrant the Local Men in Proceeding with the Work.</head>
                            <p>The committee that was appointed some time ago to canvass the advisability of holding a Transmississippi Educational congress in connection with the exposition met on the fifth floor of city hall yesterday afternoon to compare notes and decide on future action.  Superintendent Pearse of the local schools presided and Secretary Gillan of the Board of Education was made secretary.  There were also present Chancellor MacLain of the University of Nebraska, State Superintendent Jackson, Secretary J. E. Utt of the Commercial club, Superintendent A. A. Munro of South Omaha and J. C. Hisey of Council Bluffs.</p>
                            <p>During the time that has elapsed since the previous meeting each member of the committee had been carrying on an extensive correspondence to ascertain the sentiment of educators in regard to the plan proposed.  The aggregate result was in the highest degree encouraging.  A huge stack of letters represented nearly all the western states and some east of the Mississippi as well as numerous prominent individuals and most of the leading educational institutions of the west.  They were practically unanimous in their approbation of the scheme.  A very few suggested that it was feared that the congress might be taken as antagonistic to the National Educational association, but in nearly every instance these concluded with the assurance that if it was finally decided to hold the congress they could be counted on to give such assistance as lay in their power.  Out of fifteen state superintendents from whom letters were read twelve <unclear/> in favor of <unclear/> somewhat in doubt.  Even two or three members of the executive committee of the National Educational association gave the congress their endorsement and declared that it would not be construed as a slap at the association in which they were all equally interested.</p>
                            <p>It required a couple of hours to go through the correspondence and then the committee was of the unanimous opinion that it is warranted in going ahead with the enterprise.  It was contended that it will be very easy to meet the objections of those who feared that the congress would interfere with the annual convention of the National Educational association, as it is proposed to hold the congress during the last week of June and it will undoubtedly act as a feeder for the big convention at Washington.  Teachers from the western states could get the advantage of the special rates to Omaha and then go on to Washington, thus securing an additional stopover which they could not otherwise obtain.</p>
                            <p>After some further discussion it was decided to go ahead with the enterprise and Superintendent Pearse, Superintendent Jackson and Superintendent Munro were designated as a committee to prepare and submit a plan of further procedure.  It was provided that a date should be recommended that would in no way conflict with the Washington convention.</p>

                            <p>Every mail brings in a large number of applications for space by exhibitors of all classes who want to display their wares before the thousands of visitors who will throng the exposition.  These applications cover all lines of exhibits and the amount of space applied for ranges from the minimum amount which will be allowed any exhibitor, twenty square feet, to amounts running into the thousands.  These applications are filed away for future reference, the policy of the Department of Exhibits being to accept but few applications at this early day.  Few applicants have been allotted space up to this time, but the time is fast approaching when the entire list will be gone through and the best class of exhibits selected and space allotted to them in proportion to their merits and the amount of space available.</p>
                            <p>Among the applications received in this morning's mail were the following: John B. Stetson, the Philadelphia hat manufacturer, asked for 480 feet for a display of the various lines of hats turned out by his establishment.  Ben V. Waters of Omaha asked for space in which to exhibit a bicycle balance.  M. E. Smith &amp; Co. of Omaha wish to install an operating exhibit showing the manufacture of clothing in large quantities, and ask for 1,576 feet for this purpose.  Richard Bohrisch of East Las Vegas, N. M., writes that he has a patent window sash which he wishes to exhibit.  The Clonbrock Steam Boiler company of Brooklyn, N. Y., will make an exhibit of steam valves, boilers, etc.  R. G. Steacy of Lyn, Ont., writes that he is the largest breeder of dairy cattle in America, and asks for space in which to exhibit two carloads of his best stock.  Louis Wolfe of Brooklyn wishes space in which to exhibit Hans Markart's picture "Abundance of Land."  Phillip Prosen of Philadelphia wants 100 feet of space in which to display a mechanical novelty, the gyroscope.  The Burlington (Ia.) Basket company asks for 200 feet of space in the Agricultural building in which to display implements, etc.  L. E. Waterman company of New York asks for 100 feet for a display of fountain pens.  E. H. Wright of Ulysses, Neb., says he manufactures condensed smoke for curing meats and wants an opportunity to show how it works.  The Perry Mason company of Boston asks for 500 feet of wall space for a display by the Art department of the Youth's Companion.  George B. Dygert of Butte, Mont., says he has a fine collection of minerals collected in that state and wishes space to exhibit them.</p>

It has been determined that the board will issue a newspaper on Washington's birthday, February 22, which shall be devoted to the girls and boys of Nebraska and well supplied with articles written by these young members of society.  The paper will be liberally illustrated with halftone cuts of objects and persons of general interest and will be printed on heavy enamelled paper.  An edition of 50,000 copies will be issued and it is the purpose of the committee to give a local flavor in the various sections of the state by having each of the cities and towns in the state contribute to a page devoted to local items of interest and local advertising.  This page will be different in each town, the matter being supplied by a representative in each town.  The profits from this venture will be turned into the building fund in order that the work of construction may be commenced early in the spring.</p>

                            <p>Lewis W. Shurtliff of Ogden, Utah, vice president of the exposition for that state, arrived in the city yesterday and has been in conference with the exposition officials all day regarding the exhibit to be made by Utah.  Judge Shurtliff brought with him two samples of sandstone which the state offers as its contribution to the Arch of States.  These samples are of gray and red sandstone, respectively.</p>
                            <p>"I didn't bring any specimens of granite," said he, "because he thought it would not be practicable to cut it in time for the exposition.  We have plenty of stone, but we concluded that the two varieties I brought with me are the best for the purpose.</p>
                            <p>"We are going to have a good exhibit from Utah," said Judge Shurtcliff in a positive manner.  "Our mining exhibit is now being made up by Don Maguire, one of our most experienced men in that line.  He is traveling about the state, making a collection of specimens and will have an exhibit of minerals which will compare with any that can be made by any state.  Mr. Maguire has been at work for about a month and he has not visited one-half of the mining districts.</p>
                            <p>"Our agricultural display is being made up by Heber Benion, who is meeting with good success in collecting the fine specimens of our products.

                            <p>"One of our principal displays," continued the judge, "will be the irrigation display to be made by the Bear River Irrigation company.  That company will have an irrigated farm in full operation, showing the complete system in use in our state.  Our people are taking a great interest in the exposition and will be here in force."</p>

                            <p>J. P. Hymer of Deadwood, S. D., commissioner for the exposition for the Black Hills district, writes to the Department of Exhibits that the counties of that district have again taken up the matter of securing <choice><sic>represenation</sic><corr>representation</corr></choice> at the exposition.  A great deal of interest in this direction was aroused last fall, and these counties voted bond in aid of county exhibits, but legal questions were raised and the bond issue defeated after it had received a majority of the votes cast at the election.  Since that time interest has been rather dormant, but Commissioner Hymer's letter indicates that activity has been resumed.  He says the commissioners of Lawrence county, of which Deadwood is the county seat, have been asked to make a levy of 1 mill, which will provide a fund of about $4,500; and the other counties in the section have been asked to take similar action.  Mr. Hymer states that if this is not successful a fund will be raised by private subscription.  The other counties will be asked to join in this movement, in case the levy is not made, but in case they do not see fit to do so, the Black Hills district will be represented in an exhibit of its own.  Mr. Hymer says the interest in the Black Hills is thoroughly aroused and a good exhibit will be made.</p>

Just above the surface of the water this stone coping will be curved inward to form a recess in which will be placed a row of incandescent lights.  These lights will outline the lagoon and will follow the line of the stairways and approaches to the bridges, cross the water along the lower edge of the bridges and encircle the east end and the broad curves of the Mirror.</p>
                            <p>On top of this stone coping will be placed handsome staff-covered posts which will support an ornamental iron railing which will extend entirely around the lagoon except at the east end.  Commencing at the broad stairways at the east end, which afford a means of reaching the water level, the iron railing will be changed to a heavy balustrade which will encircle the beautiful east end of the lagoon and form a handsome setting for the many beauties of this portion of the canal.  Landing places for the gondolas are provided and a complete finish for this very pretty portion of the main court is contemplated.  The high, sloping bank forming the east end of the lagoon will be formed into small steps and potted plants in full bloom will be installed there, making the bank appear in a blaze of color.  This bank will be encircled by a heavy chain.</p>
                            <p>The detail drawings for the viaduct over Sherman avenue leading out of the main court to the bluff tract are nearly finished and will be turned over to the Department of Buildings and Grounds in a few days.</p>

                            <p>Colonel Robert Mitchell Floyd, chairman of the New Jersey Exposition commission, writes to the exposition authorities that the prospects are good for an appropriation by the legislature which will enable the commission to erect a state building on the exposition grounds.  The legislature meets Thursday of this week and the chairman asks that a representative of the exposition be sent to Trenton to co-operate with the commission.  E. O. Halstead of this city, a well known business man, who has extensive acquaintance in New Jersey, will start for Trenton this week to lend his assistance to the exposition commission.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Promotion Among All the States and Nations and Its Result&#8212;Thousands of Columns of Description Published.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>There is, perhaps, no department of the exposition which is so important, especially during the early stages of the enterprise, as the Department of Publicity and Promotion.  Upon the effectiveness of this department depends, in a large measure, the magnitude of the exposition.  A very brief outline of the work of the department in the promotion line was given by Manager Rosewater at the regular monthly meeting of the Board of Directors.</p>
                            <p>He said he had not had time to prepare a written report of the work of the promotion, but he summarized the work in a very few words, stating that at least thirty-five of the states of the union will take an official part in the exposition and be represented by state exhibits, as well as by individual exhibits made by the manufacturing interests of these states.  Foreign governments are manifesting an official interest in the exposition and several of them are making preparations to take part in the affair.  The republic of Mexico will be officially represented, the Chinese government has given official notice that it will be well represented, the governments of several of the states of South America have signified their intention of taking official part in the enterprise, Canada is now making preparations to erect a government building and install therein a collective exhibit, England will take part in its usual semi-official manner through the Board of Trade, which is a government institution.  The various consuls of the United States all over the world are actively at work and nearly all have expressed their determination to do all in their power to interest the mercantile bodies of the cities in which they are stationed.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">IN THE EAST AND SOUTH.</head>
                            <p>Of the states outside of the transmississippi region, there are few which will not be officially represented at the exposition; not by commercial exhibits alone, but these states will take official part in the affair through their official representatives.  Exposition commissions have been appointed in Illinois, Wisconsin, New Jersey, West Virginia, Florida and Georgia and the governors of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Kentucky are pledged to appoint commissions within a short time.  Alabama is preparing to make a state exhibit through its State Board of Agriculture; Tennessee's officials are co-operating with private interests to prepare for state representation and participation; energetic work is being done in Michigan, and Indiana and Ohio are to be aroused to official action in the near future.</p>
                            <p>These states are all outside of the transmississippi region and the action which has been taken by them and by the foreign governments referred to has not been accomplished without energetic and systematic work on the part of the Department of Publicity and Promotion.</p>
                            <p>While this work has been going on outside of the transmississippi region the states within that territory have not been left to themselves.  It has been no easy task to convince those states that their best interests would be subserved by participating in the exposition.  In many of them the legislatures failed to appreciate the importance of the affair and either failed or refused to make appropriations to enable the state to take official part.  Public spirit has been aroused in nearly all of them, however, and in those which have no appropriation strenuous efforts are being made to secure by private subscriptions sufficient money to enable the state to collect and install a state exhibit and, in some cases, to erect a state building.  At this time there are but three of these states or territories in which there seems no probability of state representation; these are Alaska, Arizona and Oklahoma.  Arkansas, Oregon and Washington have been very apathetic in the matter, but the citizens of these commonwealths are manifesting an eleventh-hour interest which may result in official action.  Private interests in each of these states will be represented at all events.</p>

                            <head type="sub">WORKS OF THE PRESS BUREAU.</head>
                            <p>In addition to the work done by the promotion contingent of the department, the public interest has been awakened through the energetic efforts of the Press bureau which has kept the exposition before the people in ever community by means of the publicity gained through the newspapers and publications of the highest class.</p>
                            <p>A report to the board of directors of the exposition which was laid before that body at its meeting last week, covered in a brief and concise manner the work of the bureau during the past year.  The report was almost entirely statistical and showed the amount of advertising which the exposition has secured during the past year through the newspapers and other publications of the country through the efforts of this department.  This report shows that the Press bureau sent out during the year 60,000 news letters to newspapers and other publications, and the returns received indicate that a very large proportion of this matter appeared in the papers to which it was sent.  Comparison with other expositions shows that the amount of free advertising thus obtained for the Transmississippi Exposition is far in excess of that given other enterprises of this nature.  One paragraph in the report is as follows:</p>
                            <p>As to the aggregate amount of gratuitous newspaper advertising which has been obtained for the exposition during the last twelve months no exact estimate can be formed.  It can be safely said, however, that the results have indeed proven satisfactory.  The press in every state and territory of the union, printed in English and foreign tongues, has given much valuable reading space constantly in promoting the success of the great exposition.  To obtain copies of every publication containing friendly mention and articles descriptive of the exposition since the Department of Publicity was first established has been an impossibility.  Not only this, but an army of people would be required to handle so voluminous a collection of printed matter.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">THOUSANDS OF COLUMNS.</head>
                            <p>The report includes a table showing the number of words of printed matter relating to the exposition which have appeared in the newspapers, magazines and periodicals of the United States during the past year.  This shows that 4,861,375 words have thus appeared.  This immense amount of free advertising is equal to 3,740 columns of The Bee and by this means the news of the exposition has been carried to the remotest corners of the United States.  Similar results have been attained in several foreign countries, Germany, especially, having been extremely liberal in this respect, due to the efforts of the German bureau of the department.  The most important newspapers and periodicals of German-speaking countries have printed scores of columns of matter relating to the exposition and the same is true to a lesser extent of the papers of France and other European countries.</p>
                            <p>In addition to this newspaper advertising the press bureau has scattered broadcast over the entire country pamphlets and pictures
                            
                            <pb n="191" xml:id="TMISB03-191"/>
                            
                            showing the main exposition buildings.  About 200,000 pieces of advertising matter have been distributed in a judicious manner.  Comparison with other expositions shows that the amount of advertising secured, in proportion to the expense incurred by the department, has not been equaled in any former exposition.</p>
                            <p>In this connection a remark made by a prominent official of the Nashville exposition early in the summer, when that affair was in full blast, speaks volumes.  He said: "If our exposition had been as thoroughly advertised when we opened as the Transmississippi Exposition is now, our attendance would have been doubled."</p>

                            <p>J. J. Farnan, an officer of the United States engineer corps, has arrived in the city to take charge of the work of construction of the Government building on the exposition grounds.  He will establish his office on the grounds at once and will have personal supervision over the work.  The contractor of this building is under bonds to complete the building by April 29, ready for occupancy, and Mr. Farnan has been detailed to see that the contract requirements are complied with.  He said yesterday that he would take charge of the work as soon as he could get his headquarters established on the grounds and would then take such action as might be necessary to have the work completed on time.  Mr. Farnan came to Omaha from Meriden, Miss., where he had charge of that construction of a postoffice building erected by the government.</p>

                            <p>The delegation from South Dakota which is in the city to accumulate information regarding the exposition, which is to be spread broadcast among the people of that state upon their return to their homes, was taken in charge this morning by a committee of members of the Board of Directors and put in the way of acquiring information on everything pertaining to the great show.  The visiting delegation includes Governor Lee, Hans Murphy of Elk Point, C. A. Davis of Deadwood, W. L. Gardner of Rapid City and C. A. Jewett of Sioux Falls.  The entertainment committee consisted of Manager Babcock, Directors John Hussie and C. F. Weller and Mr. W. S. Poppleton.  The start was made from the Paxton hotel this morning where carriages were taken and the party driven to the exposition grounds.  Here the visitors were shown everything of interest, including the buildings being erected on the main court, and the staff shop in the Mines building, where the party alighted and went through the shop, the visitors manifesting the greatest interest in the manufacture of the beautiful white coating which is to make the buildings look like marble palaces.  The bluff tract was visited and the Nebraska and Illinois building inspected.  The visitors expressed surprise and wonderment at the magnitude of the scale on which the whole construction was being carried on.  Their expressions on this point were frequent and emphatic.  They stated many times that they had no idea that preparations were making on such a grand scale, and they plied the escorting committee with questions regarding many of the details of the work.  The trip aroused the enthusiasm of the visitors to the highest pitch and they were most emphatic in stating that their state would be represented by exhibits that would be a credit to a commonwealth with such magnificent resources.  They had made the same promise before going to the grounds, but after seeing the magnitude of the preparations that were being made their statements were much more emphatic.</p>
                            <p>Returning from the grounds the party visited the office of the architects-in-chief, where the visitors were shown the plans in course of preparation for completing the decoration of the main court and supplying the finishing touches on the other portions of the ground.  If anything further had been necessary to convince the delegation that the Transmississippi and International Exposition was to be on a scale commensurate with the extent and importance of the vast region which is to be represented it was found in these drawings showing the decorations which are to embellish the whole and furnish a fitting setting for the beautiful architecture.</p>
                            <p>The Millard hotel was reached at noon and here the visitors were entertained at luncheon by the executive committee, which was in regular session.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles has appointed the following five directors as members of the Bureau of Public Comfort: Dudley Smith, Arthur C. Smith, C. M. Wilhelm, C. F. Weller and R. S. Wilcox.  This bureau will be under the direction of the Ways and Means department of the exposition and will at once take up the matter of investigating the capacity of Omaha hotels, boarding houses, lodging houses and private houses to accommodate the thousands of people who will visit Omaha during the coming year.  The best method of supplying any deficiency in accommodations will be suggested by this bureau.</p>
                            <p>This matter was first agitated by the Commercial club, which appointed a committee of three and requested the exposition management the Woman's club and the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben to appoint similar committees to form a committee of twelve to take charge of this matter.  At its first meeting this committee reached the conclusion that the whole subject should be taken up and worked out by some body under the direction of the exposition and the result is the <choice><sic>dreation</sic><corr>creation</corr></choice> of the Bureau of Public Comfort.  The first three directors named on this bureau were the exposition's representatives on the committee appointed at the request of the Commercial club, so that nothing that has been done in the direction of the committee's work will be lost.</p>
                            <p>The formal announcement of the appointment of the members of this bureau will be made by President Wattles at the meeting of the Board of Directors late this afternoon and a meeting of the bureau will be called by the chairman.</p>

The picture is the most striking of any that has yet been issued of this beautiful building and shows off the elaborate decoration to the best advantage.  The department has cuts made in "line drawing," for newspaper work, and in half-tone for magazines and fine printing.

                            <head type="sub">Children to Be Called upon for Their Contributions.</head>
                            <p>Today the teachers and principals in all the Council Bluffs school buildings will talk to the pupils concerning the contributions that will be asked from them for the fund to erect the Boys' and Girls' <choice><sic>biulding</sic><corr>building</corr></choice> at the Transmississippi Exposition.  Mrs. Judge Reed has designated tomorrow as "rally day" in the schools, when the patronesses will visit all of the schools, make short talks on the subjects and distribute the booklets.  On the following day the collection will be taken up at the close of the daily session of the schools.  The patronesses today will thoroughly explain the enterprise and show the importance of each child bringing a small contribution.  On "rally day" a program of special exercises will be prepared, which will be of a patriotic nature and will still further prepare the minds of the children for the donations on the following day, when all of the children are expected to bring their money.  Those neglecting or forgetting it may make their donations on Friday morning.  The school board has given consent for only the one collection to be taken up, and it is expected that so far as possible the donations will be made on Thursday.  Contributions made after that must be given to the teachers, who will be required to keep a strict account of all received and send a copy of the same to the patronesses, together with the money.  The patronesses will hold a meeting in the parlors of the Grand hotel on Saturday morning.  No particular amount has been specified as the proper sum for each child to bring, but Mrs. Reed is encouraged to believe that the collection will approximate close to $2,000.  For the 4,000 pupils in the public schools this will make 50 cents for each child, but many of them have expressed their determination to give $1 or more.</p>
                            <p>The names of the patronesses who will visit the schools today follow: Washington avenue, Mrs. C. M. Harle; Bloomer, Mrs. Thomas Metcalf; High school, Mrs. Atkins; Madison avenue, Mrs. Forrest Smith; Pierce street, Mrs. Charles Beno; Second avenue, Mrs. W. Dudley; Avenue B, Mrs. A. C.

                            <head type="sub">Montana, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah All Sending on Photographs of Lovely Young Women.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The "beauty contest" instituted by the exposition management for the purpose of securing photographs from which to make a picture showing the condensed loveliness of the women of the transmississippi region is causing a furore of excitement among the many thousands of beautiful women who are to be found in every city, village and hamlet of this broad domain.  About ten days ago letters were sent by Chairman Lindsey of the executive committee of the exposition to the vice president of the exposition to the vice president of the exposition in each transmississippi state, asking that officer to select the two most beautiful women in his state and send to the exposition management a cabinet photograph of each, showing a full profile view of the head and shoulders of the subject, these pictures to be used in making a composite picture to form the model for one side of the souvenir medal of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>This letter has been received in all of the states and has been made public through the newspapers.  The result is that the women have become deeply interested in the matter and are readily lending their aid to the project.  Different methods have been adopted in different states for making the selection.  In nearly every case the vice president avoids the responsibility of choosing the wrong woman and appoints a committee of unsuspecting patriots who are to make the selection.</p>
                            <p>In Montana Vice President Sutherlin has selected a committee of eleven guileless editors for this purpose.  In a letter addressed to the appointees Mr. Sutherlin says:</p>
                            <p>As there are so many beautiful young women in our state, all apparently deserving of the honor to be conferred, the task of selecting the two most beautiful will indeed be the most difficult that has fallen to my lot, and I have therefore decided to call to my assistance a committee of the generous editors of the state, whose names are as follows: J. M. Quinn, Quinn's Review; Sam Gordon, Yellowstone Journal; E. L. Boardman, Carbon County Sentinel; P. A. Jullian, Butte Miner; C. H. Edwards, Montana Fruit Grower; A. K. Yerkes, Bozeman Chronicle; F. E. Foote, Dillon Tribune; S. M. Moore, Herald-Journal; G. W. Silkes, Helena Independent; R. E. Fisk, Helena Herald, and C. H. Eggleston of the Anaconda Standard.  The above named committee will convene in the parlors of the Helena hotel on Saturday, January 15, at 2 p. m.  While the autograph of each applicant to be judged will appear on the back of her photograph, the committee will be in honor bound not to read the same until the selection has been made, and only the names of the successful candidates will be known.  You need not bring your lunch basket, as it is probable that friends of the successful competitors will supply needful refreshments.  I assure you this will be a meeting of no small importance, and I hope you will make it convenient to attend promptly.</p>

                            <p>Vice President Frank H. Peavey of Minnesota has shifted the responsibility imposed on him by Manager Lindsey.  In a letter just received from him is the following paragraph:</p>
                            <p>Regarding the medal matter I have appointed a committee on selection of five prominent gentlemen considered to be experts on beauty, and they have organized and will conduct an active campaign, and no doubt the competition for the selection from this state will be strong and spirited.  I understand you have received the selections from some of the states.  Will you please advise me how many, and what have been the various modes of making the selections, so far as you know.  If you could send the photographs here for inspection, I would appreciate it, as it would give us a chance to make a comparison before we everlastingly commit ourselves.  You know, we think we have the most beautiful women in the world in Minnesota, but we are anxious to make sure.</p>

                            <head type="sub">NEBRASKA MAIDENS COME FORWARD.</head>
                            <p>Judge William Neville of North Platte, vice president of the exposition for Nebraska, is having troubles of his own in making the selection of the two handsomest women in Nebraska.  Several days ago the judge requested that all the handsome women in the state send him their photographs, so that he might select the two handsomest as Nebraska's contribution to the composite medal.  This request was published in the newspapers and since that time the judge's mail has swelled until it has reached enormous proportions.  Every mail into North Platte contains photographs from all parts of the state addressed to the vice president, but the judge is greatly troubled by the fact that the senders seem to have no regard whatever for the conditions which must be complied with.  It was expressly stated in every mention of the matter that the pictures must be profile views of the head and shoulders of the subject.  This rule was made because the head which is to be engraved on the medal is to be a profile of a woman and a composite profile picture cannot be made by using any other than profile views of all the subjects.  Regardless of this condition, the pictures received by Judge Neville are of every kind and condition.  Some are profile pictures, but the majority are front views of various degrees, while some are three-quarter length, others show the full figure and others show nothing but the head.</p>
                            <p>The judge has appealed to the newspapers to proclaim to the thousands of beautiful women in Nebraska that nothing but full profile pictures can be considered and those who have no pictures must get them and send them to North Platte at once if they want to be considered in the competition.</p>

                            <p>In Wyoming the work of making the selection has been parceled out among the boards of commissioners of the several counties, and each board will select the two most beautiful and these will be sent to the vice president, whose task will thus be made easier.  Colorado is considering the advisability of choosing its beauties from the county representatives who participated in the festival of mountain and plain last fall, and the suggestion has been made in Utah that a selection might be made from the models of loveliness who participated in the jubilee celebration.  Vice President Shurtliff of Utah, who is in the city, says he has hesitated somewhat about embarking in the matter, as he has been rather careful about walking boldly into trouble, but he says he will undertake the task, unless he can find some bolder man who will relieve him of the responsibility.</p>

                            <p>Louis C. Elson of Boston has accepted the position tendered him by Homer Moore on the committee to organize a national congress of musicians to be held in Omaha during the exposition.  Mr. Elson is the musical editor of the Boston Advertiser, a member of the faculty of the New England Conservatory of Music, the author of several books, the editor of numerous publications issued by Oliver Ditson &amp; Co. and other music publishers and one of the leading American lecturers upon musical subjects.  Last summer at the meeting of the National Music Teachers' association in New York he was chairman of the committee on journalism.  Mr. Elson will look after the interests of the congress in Boston and New England and will also deliver an address on "The Songs of the People," treating of the origin of folksongs and national songs and their relationship to the nature and history of the peoples that have produced them.  Mr. Elson is a specialist on the subject and is the author of a very valuable book about it.</p>

                            <p>He found Vice President Peavey of that state overwhelmed with business, but a call for a meeting of representative business men was issued and a meeting held at the Commercial club, which was attended by about 100 of the most prominent representatives of all the large business interests.  Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion went to Minneapolis to address this meeting and General Manderson, who happened to be in the city, was drafted to address the meeting.  A favorable impression was produced and as a result a committee was appointed to await the governor and request him to appoint a state commission to commence the work of getting ready for state participation in the exposition.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 12.&#8212;The authorities of the Postoffice department have determined upon the subjects which shall be illustrated upon the new series of postage stamps to be issued by the department in commemoration of the Transmississippi and International Exposition to be opened on the first of next June at Omaha.  They are illustrative of the conditions, progress and accomplishments of the great west from its discovery to our own day.  The series comprises nine denominations of stamps as follows:</p>
                            <p>One-cent&#8212;The discovery of the Mississippi river by Marquette.</p>
                            <p>Two-cent&#8212;An Indian chief.</p>
                            <p>Four-cent&#8212;A buffalo hunting scene.</p>
                            <p>Five-cent&#8212;The Pathfinder, being a picture of Fremont raising the flag on the summit of the Rockies.</p>
                            <p>Eight-cent&#8212;A train of emigrants crossing the plains.</p>
                            <p>Ten-cent&#8212;A mining scene.</p>
                            <p>Fifty-cent&#8212;A cowboy and cattle.</p>
                            <p>Dollar&#8212;A harvesting scene or a great flouring mill.</p>
                            <p>Two dollars&#8212;The Union Pacific bridge, showing part of the city of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>The director of the mint, who is required by special act of congress to prepare the commemorative or souvenir medals for this enterprise, has today approved the subjects to be illustrated and artists are now preparing the designs.  The reverse will be a group comprising a mounted Indian spearing a buffalo.  Above will be the word Transmississippi, and below the date, 1898.  The obverse of this medal will show the head and profile of the typical young woman of the transmississippi region.  The design is to be prepared by Rockwood by means of composite photography, and the types are now being selected by the states and territories of the entire region.  The medals, like the stamps, testify the progress of civilization, from the beginning of things fifty years ago to the finest and most refined product of the half century.  The medals are within the protection of all the laws against counterfeiting the coins of the government.</p>

                            <p>KANSAS CITY, Mo., Jan. 11.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The Missouri commission to the Transmississippi Exposition today issued an address to the people of Missouri in the interest of an adequate state exhibit.</p>
                            <p>"While this exposition is international in scope," says the address, "and is already assured of extensive foreign exhibits and attendance, it is, as its name implies, a distinctly western enterprise, designed expressly for advertising to the world the productions, resources and progress of the transmississippi states and territories.  Through a misunderstanding of the intent and purpose of this undertaking the last session of our state legislature failed to provide by appropriation for an exhibit of Missouri's productions.</p>
                            <p>"The vast territory that this exposition represents&#8212;the west, northwest and southwest&#8212;is the rational and legitimate market for the products of our industries, the surplus outputs of our orchards, factories and workshops; and we are convinced that no previous exposition held in America afforded so favorable an opportunity as the present one for advertising to the whole commercial world the varied productions and matchless resources of our state; and we earnestly appeal to the pride of every state-loving, progressive citizen for a creditable exhibit of your interests.  Our neighboring states are exerting all their energies to excel.  We can surpass all of them in the extent and excellence of our exhibits if proper effort is put forth.  We must do this&#8212;its results will redound to the benefit of every citizen.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="193" xml:id="TMISB03-193"/>
                            
                            <p>"Your commission, having confidence in your patriotism and state pride, solicits your assistance.  Having no state appropriation we must depend upon voluntary contributions to defray necessary expenses.  We want to erect a creditable state building as a home and meeting place for the thousands of Missourians who will visit the exposition.  Our sister states are providing such buildings and we cannot afford to do less.  We hope to make the finest exhibit of fruits ever seen in America; to collect and place on exhibition meritorious products of our farms, forests, mines and factories, all of which will require money to pay expenses.</p>
                            <p>"We appeal to every farmer and artisan, every business and professional man, to immediately send to the treasurer of the commission, Hon. F. E. Marshall, cashier of the Continental National bank, St. Louis, whatever sum you can afford.  Every board of trade and commercial club throughout the state is urgently requested to immediately extend substantial aid.  The time is short and we must hasten the work.  Every manufacturer and every producer of meritorious articles is invited to exhibit his productions.  You will have the world for an audience and your 'bread cast upon the waters' will return many fold."</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 11.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Captain Ward, in charge of the War department exhibit at Omaha, has instructed Mr. Mercer that the ordinance department has approved his suggestion for one eight-inch rifled gun and disappearing carriage for show at the Omaha exposition, the same to be sent to the Pacific coast and to be used for coast defense after the close of the exposition.  The gun and carriage will weigh sixty tons and will have to be transported on immense flat cars built for the purpose.</p>
                            <p>A delegation of the members of the government board having charge of the exhibit at Omaha, Secretary Cox, Prof. Clark of the Interior department and Ravenal of the Fish commission, had an interview with Congressman Mercer today in relation to legislation affecting the board.  Under the old bill it is alleged that while provision is made for transportation of the government exhibit to Omaha, there is nothing said about making the exhibit, and it is to correct this and other administrative features that the delegation called upon Mercer.  Owing to the shortness of time the board has given up the idea of passing the bill giving them larger powers and will concentrate their efforts on getting modifications in the urgency deficiency bill reported in the house today.  Mercer received the consent of Chairman Cannon to bring in an amendment tomorrow, which will contain the features most desired by the government board and will give that body power to purchase, prepare, install and continue the exhibit at Omaha during the exposition.  All members of the board are anxious to make this exhibit the crowning achievement of the government and the change in the program meets with the hearty approval of those interested in the success of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Congressman Mercer has taken up to the Treasury department complaints received from Omaha that the government building for the exposition is not being pushed during good weather with that rapidity which is desirable, and also that there was a disposition to discriminate against union labor.  The treasury people said they would give instructions to push the work on the building during good weather and assured Mr. Mercer that union labor would be recognized.</p>

                            <p>DES MOINES, Ia., Jan. 11.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The exposition commission for Iowa, instituted by the last legislature, will ask that $50,000 be appropriated by the present legislature for representing this state at the exposition.  A meeting of the executive committee of the commission appointed by the executive council was held today.  An estimate of the amount needed to represent Iowa creditably and plans for the structure that will be built on the exposition grounds for this state were considered.  At 3 o'clock the committee had a meeting with the executive council and the same matters were submitted for consideration.  What the legislature will do is conjecturable.  The committee that has managed the affairs of the commission feels not disposed to urge anything on the lawmakers; it will simply state what, in its judgment, is needed to do justice to Iowa before the people who will visit the exposition.  The committee is: J. H. Packard of Marshalltown, formerly governor of Louisiana; S. D. Cook of Davenport, R. H. Moore of Ottumwa, S. H. Mallory of Chariton and F. N. Chase of Cedar Falls.  In the legislature investigation discovers a friendly feeling toward the exposition in all parts of the state and those interested in the matter express considerable confidence that a suitable appropriation will be made despite the opposition that has been raised in some quarters.</p>

Their proposition will include rates for hauling these goods from the local depots to the exposition grounds, whether received in car lots or in smaller quantities.</p>
                            <p>This move on the part of the draymen grows out of the failure of the representatives of the local lines to agree upon the proposition to appoint a joint agent, which was discussed and practically abandoned at a meeting held in Manager Babcock's office last week.  Since that time the Department of Transportation has had under consideration various plans of taking care of the immense amount of freight which will be received over all the lines for the exposition.  Much of this freight will be in small shipments, occupying only a small part of a car, and the question of handling this freight to the best advantage of all concerned has <choice><sic>bene</sic><corr>been</corr></choice> under consideration at the hands of the Transportation department for some time.</p>
                            <p>All of the large transfer lines were represented at the meeting held <choice><sic>ystrday</sic><corr>yesterday</corr></choice> and they will submit a <choice><sic>pan</sic><corr>plan</corr></choice> to the department next week.  Those attending the meeting were: John Bekins of the Omaha Van and Storage company; J. A. Johnson of Johnson Bros. Transfer <choice><sic>ine</sic><corr>Line</corr></choice>, W. P. Adkins of Holmes &amp; Adkins, W. A. Gordon of the Expressman's Delivery company, and Edward Sterricker of the Omaha Merchants' Express company.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Manager Lindsey Presents the Name of Willard Kimball of Lincoln.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee took action on the appointment of a musical director of the exposition at its regular meeting yesterday afternoon and Willard Kimball, director of the School of Music of the University of Nebraska was appointed to the position, provided his plan of music for the exposition receives the approval of the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>The matter was laid before the executive committee by Mr. Lindsey, manager of the Department of Ways and Means, who first withdrew the name of Thomas J. Pennell, which was presented several months ago, but never acted upon, and then submitted the following written report, which was adopted:</p>
                            <p>After duly considering the application of the various candidates for the position of musical director of the exposition, I desire to propose and recommend the name of Mr. Willard Kimball, director of the School of Music of the University of Nebraska at Lincoln.  Mr. Kimball's phenomenal success at Oberlin, O.; Grinnell, Ia., and for the last three years at Lincoln, where he has built up a school of 400 pupils, shows him to be a man of untiring energy and perseverance&#8212;qualifications necessary to successfully carry on the musical part of the exposition.  His studies in Boston and afterward at Leipzig, where he was under the celebrated Carl Reinecke, gave him a thorough musical education.  His references show him to be not only master of the piano, but also of the pipe organ, and equally well versed in the science of harmony and musical composition.  He has successfully presented at different times the great oratorios and understands the great orchestral writers and their works.  He is highly recommended as a reliable business man.</p>
                            <p>He proposes to take full charge of the musical affairs of the exposition, beginning at once, for the sum of $2,000, on the following conditions: One thousand dollars to be guaranteed and salary to be paid monthly, and the remaining $1,000 to be paid only on condition that the profits of musical entertainments within the Auditorium under his direction reach $2,000.  In case the profits exceed the sum of $2,000, he is to share equally with the exposition management in the net receipts above that amount.  The exposition will also employ a stenographer for Mr. Kimball, furnish him office room in Omaha, pay necessary traveling expenses when on exposition business, but no living expenses while in Lincoln or Omaha.  Mr. Kimball's plan is substantially the same as that presented in previous reports, contemplating a high order of music and in carrying it out he proposes to use competent local musicians as far as possible.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kimball will give all the time necessary for the work of this bureau and will be subject at all times to the rules of the exposition and to the Department of Ways and Means, especially in the matter of the expenditure of money, advertising, making contracts, hiring bands, orchestral performers, engaging soloists and employes, arranging programs, etc.</p>
                            <p>In view of the fact that only a few months shall elapse before the opening of the exposition, I request that the executive committee take immediate action upon this report.</p>
                            <p>R. W. Richardson, special commissioner for the Department of Promotion and Publicity, who has been in Missouri working up interest in the exposition, appeared before the committee and reported on the result of the labors in that state.  He also notified the committee that the Missouri Exposition commission will arrive in Omaha over the Burlington line at 6:30 a. m. Saturday of this week.  The committee authorized the usual courtesies to be extended to the visiting delegation and they will be met at the depot by a committee to be appointed by President Wattles and escorted to the Millard hotel for breakfast.  They will be escorted to the exposition grounds later in the day and will be entertained at luncheon at noon by the executive committee.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Judge Neville is Using an Honest Box and a New Desk.</head>
                            <p>Judge William Neville of North Platte, vice president of the exposition for Nebraska, is in his glory in the "beauty contest," which he has instituted among the handsome women of Nebraska in order to secure the picture of the two handsomest women in the state to form Nebraska's contribution to the composite picture which is to form the model of the reverse side of the exposition souvenir medal.  The judge says he is receiving pictures by the hundreds and is simply reveling in beauty.  The only thing that is causing him any uneasiness is the fact that a large number of the handsomest pictures yet received are not profile views of the subjects, and cannot be considered.  He says he is afraid he will be limited in his choice if the women do not comply more strictly with the rule requiring the picture to be a full profile of the head and shoulders.</p>
                            <p>Judge Neville announces that he will receive picture until February 1, at which time the lists will close and the process of picking out the two handsomest women in the lot will commence.  Asked if he would make the selection himself or call in others to assist in the operation, the judge's face assumed a wounded expression and he answered in a most positive manner.  "This is a most important matter and I shall take upon myself the responsibility of deciding the question.  This case is being tried without a jury and I think the question of fact involved can be passed upon by the court without the assistance of a jury.  I shall make my decision shortly after the evidence is all in my hands and the decision will be made public in the newspapers of the state."</p>
                            <p>There is a measure of satisfaction in store for those women who may not be chosen as the representatives of Nebraska beauty.  Judge Neville announces that he will have all the pictures handsomely framed and hung in the rotunda of the Nebraska building, so that all comers might see for themselves the counterfeit presentment of the thousands of beautiful women in Nebraska.  The judge believes that this display will have a strong effect on immigration to Nebraska, especially among the young men of the east, and that, as a result, the matrimonial market will experience a wave of prosperity which will bring about thousands of desirable matrimonial alliances.  In the opinion of the honorable vice president, this prospect should arouse the patriotism of Nebraska women, especially those living in a state of single blessedness, and result in a still greater number of pictures being received.</p>

                            <p>"What can I tell you?" answered General Manager Dickinson, when the question was put to him in the Knutsford corridor by a Salt Lake Tribune Reporter.  "There are no developments in railroad matters," he continued, "but the road is in excellent condition.  I find business seems to be very good.  I was pleased to see such evidences of prosperity in Utah as indicated by the crowds on the streets today.  It looks very encouraging for the future of the state.</p>
                            <p>"Come down to the Transmississippi Exposition," the general manager continued, "and you will be able to get plenty of news.  The exposition will be only second to the World's fair.  The preparations are going on steadily, and I am sure the exposition will be a great success.</p>
                            <p>"Yes, an immense crowd is expected, and as far as the Union Pacific is concerned, it will aim to take care of all the passengers who may go to the exposition."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dickinson went on to say that the exposition is not merely a Nebraska enterprise, but it was gotten up and is being successfully carried out by and for all the Transmississippi states.  The exposition will be on a magnificent scale, and the railroad official, who is also a director of the Transmississippi Exposition, is of the opinion that it will be a complete success, and will draw an immense number of people to the west.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Committee of Exposition Officials Appointed to Look After the Missouri Visitors Tomorrow.</head>
                            <p>The members of the Missouri Exposition commission will arrive in the city Saturday morning to see for themselves what has been done in the way of making preparations for holding the exposition.  They will arrive at 6:30 a. m. and will go at once to the Millard hotel, which will be their headquarters during their stay in Omaha.  At 10 o'clock a special committee of exposition officials and directors will meet the visitors at the hotel.  This committee has been appointed by President Wattles as follows: R. W. Richardson, special commissioner to Missouri, chairman; C. F. Manderson, J. E. Markel, C. S. Montgomery, Dudley Smith, H. A. Thompson, Lucius Wells of Council Bluffs, vice president for Iowa; C. E. Yost and L. H. Korty.</p>
                            <p>This committee will escort the Missouri commission to the exposition grounds and offices and show them everything to be seen in that connection, returning to the Millard at 1 o'clock, where the visitors and the special committee will join the executive committee at luncheon.</p>
                            <p>Advices from St. Louis are to the effect that there will be about fifty members of the delegation.  Secretary V. M. Sterrett of the St. Louis Exposition commission writes to Secretary Wakefield that the Missouri delegation will be in two sections, one starting from St. Louis and the other from Kansas City.  He says there will be about twenty-five persons in each contingent, the St. Louis party being composed of ten members of the state commission and the other being members of the St. Louis commission.</p>
                            <p>The Kansas City party will arrive on the Burlington at 6:30 a. m., and the St. Louis section will arrive over the Burlington at 7:55 a. m.  The whole party will remain in the city until 8 p. m., when the members will leave for their homes via the Burlington.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the members of the reception committee named by President Wattles yesterday the president has appointed C. F. Weller and W. H. Green to the committee and will add his own efforts to those of the special committee and of the executive committee to entertain the visitors.</p>
                            <p>The Missouri commission is the fifth of the state exposition commissions to visit Omaha in a body.  The Iowa commission led the way, and was followed by the commissions of Illinois, Wyoming and South Dakota.  Practically the entire membership of each of these commissions visited Omaha and were shown all there was to be seen and given all desired information by the several departments.  Without exception, these delegations have expressed themselves in terms of surprise at the scale on which the arrangements are being made and the effect of their visits has been apparent in the renewed vigor with which they have taken up the work on their return to their homes.</p>
                            <p>In addition to these visits of the entire commissions, representatives of the commissions of Utah, North Dakota, Montana and Wisconsin have visited Omaha on the same errand and it has developed, without exception, that these visits have done a vast amount of good.  They have served to spread the news of what Omaha is doing and have established the fact that the Transmississippi and International Exposition will be second only to the World's fair in importance and magnitude.</p>

                            <p>The people of Denver are making preparations to come to the exposition in force, and to take a prominent part in the affair, which will be befitting the capital and metropolis of the Centennial state.  Mayor McMurray of Denver has appointed a Denver exposition commission and has charged it with the duty of collecting and installing a Denver exhibit and arranging for a "Denver day" at the exposition, when the people of Denver may visit the exposition in force and enjoy a celebration commensurate with their enthusiastic interest in the exposition.  The commission appointed by the mayor is as follows: Hon. Platt Rogers, E. H. Webb, W. S. Ward, W. C. Ashwill, A. B. Moulton, Granville Malcolm, W. F. Bailey, Mrs. Sarah S. Platt, Mrs. I. M. Appel.  This commission will meet Monday next and organize for business.</p>

A mass meeting of the people of that district, including seven counties, has been called for this week.  Commissioner Godding of the State Exposition commission is one of the prime movers in this matter and he will head a committee from this section which will visit Omaha in the near future.</p>
                            <p>Secretary George M. Mischke of the Colorado <choice><sic>Exposniito</sic><corr>Exposition</corr></choice> commission writes to the Department of Exhibits that the preparations for a state exhibit from Colorado have been delayed by the fact that the appeal sent to the boards of county commissioners of all the counties in the state has not been acted on because of the changes in the personnel of many of these boards.  He says favorable results are anticipated as soon as the new boards are organized.</p>

                            <p>The people of the Black Hills district of South Dakota do not take kindly to the action of Governor Lee and the other members of the exposition commission from that state in cancelling the reservation of 6,000 square feet of space in the Mines building and taking only 600 feet in that building for South Dakota's mineral display.  Commissioner J. P. Hymer of Deadwood, who reserved the 6,000 feet of space cancelled by the governor, writes a rather caustic letter to the Department of Exhibits, in which he severely criticises the action of the governor in thus attempting to belittle the mineral resources of the state.  His letter was written before the South Dakota delegation which visited Omaha had returned home and he writes: "I shall take no action in this until the commission returns from Omaha, but I wish to say that the people of the Black Hills will never consent to make an exhibit on 600 square feet nor on two or three times that amount."  Commissioner Hymer expresses pleasure at hearing that Governor Lee had become interested in the exposition.  Mr. Hymer says all interests in the state will work in harmony and a good state exhibit will be made, but the Black Hills will be represented on a scale commensurate with its importance.</p>

We are of the opinion that people who come from the north and east to visit the exposition will take advantage of the reduced rates to examine this entire northwest country.  We in Sioux City will undoubtedly have a counter attraction, which will in no sense rival or attempt to interfere with the big show.  It will probably take the form of a carnival or festival of some sort, but were there no selfish interests whatever involved we still feel under an obligation to Omaha

These frames lend an artistic finish to the handsome picture and give the whole an appearance of elegance and beauty which make these publications of the department a desirable ornament to any public place.  It is the intention of the department to distribute these in the principal railroad offices of the country, the leading hotels, club houses and similar places where they will be seen by the public.  A large number of applications have already been received for these pictures.</p>
                            <p>The souvenir album issued by the department is being purchased in large lots by the leading business houses in the city.  The project is meeting with great favor and is proving very popular with the merchants.  These albums are sold to the merchants at about the actual cost and the buyer is given a small space for a card.  A parchment cover and artistic work on the pictures makes a souvenir which is a desirable memento.</p>

It contains the latest information regarding the exposition and handsome half-tone cuts of the main exposition buildings.  The beautiful new picture of the Government building, drawn in the office of the supervising architect of the Treasury department, is printed in half-tone for the first time in this pamphlet.  These pamphlets are in great demand and are being sent all over the United States in the great German centers and to the German countries of Europe.</p>
                            <p>The department is preparing a large lot of advertising matter which will be sent out with the party of merchants who are going to Port Arthur and other southern points through the courtesy of President Stillwell of the Port Arthur route.  This matter will be thoroughly distributed along the line in every town of importance.</p>

                            <p>"Washington should make some effort to enter a creditable display in the Omaha exposition," said Seymour Bell of South Bend, Wash., to a reporter of the Tacoma Ledger.  He is a prominent mining and timber land proprietor and has just returned form an extensive trip through the east.</p>
                            <p>"The buildings for the exposition are now in course of erection and when built they will rival anything ever attempted in this country outside of the World's fair at Chicago.  The fair will be attended by thousands.  Business is better everywhere, and next summer the people will seek such pleasures.  Those of the east will be anxious to get an opportunity to study the resources of the west close at home.  The attendance at the exposition will be nearly as large, if not fully as large, as that of the World's fair.  Other western states have made appropriations for the purpose of making creditable displays of their resources.  The last legislature refused to make an appropriation for this purpose, but a vice president for Washington has been appointed.</p>
                            <p>"The largest and best building in the exposition will be devoted to the mining interests and this state should have a display.  Her mines are in their infancy, but are destined to be one of the most important of the state's resources.</p>
                            <p>"The east should be informed of the wealth of this state through a large display.  The cost would not be large and the returns would be immense.  The Chamber of Commerce should advocate this matter, and the money necessary to defray the expenses should be raised by popular subscription.  The other resources of Washington should also be given a place, but I consider the mines of the most importance."</p>

                            <p>At a meeting of the executive committee yesterday afternoon an abstract of the bids received for constructing the walks and drives on the bluff tract was laid before the committee by Manager Kirkendall.  There were five bids, the one most favored by the committee and the one which seemed to be the lowest being that of VanCourt &amp; Winn, who offered to construct the walks, using two inches of broken stone for a base and covering it with one inch of gravel, at 14.9 cents per square yard, and the drives, using three inches of broken stone in the center and two inches on the sides and covering the whole surface with two inches of gravel, for 20 cents per square yard.  The bids were referred to Manager Kirkendall to determine upon the lowest bid and submit a contract.</p>

                            <p>Fire Chief Redell has a letter from Fred A. Wood, president of the Iowa State Firemen's association, Cedar Rapids, Ia., asking his support toward holding a national firemen's tournament in this city during the Transmississippi Exposition.  President Wood says that at the last convention of the International Association of Fire Engineers, held at New Haven, C<unclear/> last August, the subject of holding a tournament in connection with the annual convention of firemen was discussed and favorably commented upon.  The next convention of the International body went to St. Louis, but President Woods contends that a tournament might be held in this city the same year and that the fact of the exposition being here would prove an additional factor in having the tournament take place in Omaha.  A meeting of firemen will be held in Chicago during the early spring, and it is the intention of this meeting, which will be attended by fire officials from several states in the Transmississippi belt, to settle the location for holding the tournament.  Chief Redell will do his utmost in having Omaha selected as the next meeting place.</p>

                            <p>The preliminary plans for the educational congress to be held in Omaha next June in connection with the Transmississippi Exposition were perfected at a meeting of the general committee which was held at the office of Superintendent Pearse in the city hall last night.  The general outline of the working organization was agreed on and the committee who will have active supervision of the work were selected and approved.  There were present Superintendent Pearse, Victor Rosewater, Secretary Urr of the Commercial club, Superintendent A. A. Munro of South Omaha, State Superintendent Jackson, J. M. Gillan and Superintendent J. C. Hisey of Council Bluffs.  The general outline of the proposed organization was submitted by Superintendent Pearse in behalf of the special committee which was appointed at the previous meeting to consider the subject.  It provided that the enterprise should be divided into five district departments, each of which should be in charge of a committee of three members and to be known as the committees respectively on finance, transportation, entertainment, program and publicity.  The chairmen of these committee are to constitute the executive committee which will have general charge of the operations of all committees, approve all plans which involve the expenditure of money and decide on all general plans of procedure.</p>
                            <p>The recommendation was discussed at some length and finally adopted.  The committees were then selected as follows:</p>
                            <p>Finance&#8212;W. R. Jackson, Isaac Carpenter and J. H. Dumont.</p>
                            <p>Transportation&#8212;J. E. Utt, W. N. Babcock and J. E. Baum.</p>

                            <p>Publicity&#8212;Victor Rosewater, Miss Anna Foos and R. C. Jordan.</p>
                            <p>It was also understood that the committees should be authorized to appoint such subcommittees as might be necessary to carry on different lines of work with the approval of the executive committee.  It was decided that the congress should occupy three days, but the date was left open to be fixed by the executive committee.  At the first meeting of the executive committee next Tuesday the finance committee will be expected to submit a detailed statement of the prospective expenses and possible resources of the convention and the other committees to outline their work.</p>

                            <head type="sub">State Board of Agriculture Endorses Omaha's Show.</head>
                            <p>KANSAS CITY, Mo., Jan. 14.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The Kansas State Board of Agriculture, in session at Topeka this afternoon, unanimously adopted strong resolutions endorsing the plan for adequate Kansas representation at the Transmississippi Exposition and pledging the support of the board for all efforts in that direction.  This action was taken after Governor Leedy had appeared before the board and explained the situation, that the state legislature had failed to make an appropriation for an exhibit and that whatever was done must be accomplished by individuals, associations and boards.  The governor urged that the Board of Agriculture father the work which he has already outlined and begun.  The resolutions declare that:</p>
                            <p>"We, the members of the Kansas State Board of Agriculture, as representatives of the agricultural interests of the state, do most heartily endorse and approve the Transmississippi Exposition as a demonstration in which every state in the transmississippi country should participate."</p>
                            <p>The board is without funds to prosecute the work of arranging for a Kansas exhibit, but it is confidently believed that, without money, it will be able to accomplish as much as it did prior to the World's fair, when, in the absence of a legislative appropriation, it pushed the work of state organization and raised an abundance of money for satisfactory representation.</p>
                            <p>KANSAS CITY, Mo., Jan. 14.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;About thirty representative business men, including a staff man from each of the four daily newspapers, left from Kansas City at 9:15 p. m. over the Burlington for Omaha, to meet with others from St. Louis and other portions of the state, all to consider the proposition that Missouri erect a building at the Transmississippi Exposition.  The Kansas City contingent will also consider the erection of a special Kansas City building in case it is decided not to erect a state building, and in any case will study the desirability and the possibility of making a Kansas City display.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The delegation from Missouri which came to inspect the progress being made by Omaha in preparing for the Transmississippi and International Exposition arrived in the city this morning on two Burlington trains, one section of the party coming from Kansas City and the other from St. Louis, with many additions from intermediate points.  Immediately upon their arrival the visitors went direct to the Millard hotel, where they took breakfast and where they were met a little later by the reception committee appointed to look after their comfort.  The time until 10:30 o'clock was spent in getting acquainted.  When this was accomplished it was found that the Missouri Exposition commission is represented by Clark H. Sampson, president, of St. Louis; G. A. Atwood, third vice president, of Springfield; F. E. Marshall, treasurer, of St. Louis; M. V. Carroll, secretary, of Jefferson City; F. M. Sterrett, assistant secretary, of St. Louis; E. T. Abbott, F. W. Maxwell, R. M. Davis, A. J. Fleming, of St. Joseph; J. H. Hedgpeth of Rockport, John F. Richards, Phil E. Mullins, W. W. Morgan and George W. Fuller of Kansas City; J. N. Ballard of Montrose, W. H. Allen of Clinton, C. C. Davidson of El Dorado Springs, J. W. Baldwin and J. N. Dalby of Sedalia, J. D. Tolson of Fayette, H. W. Ewing of Jefferson City; H. A. Blossom, P. J. Toomey, W. H. Phelps, C. P. Walbridge of St. Louis; J. H. Berkshire of Winona, C. A. Emery of Carthage, John H. Taylor of Joplin and C. M. Manker of Webb City.  In addition to the St. Louis members of the state commission, nearly all of whom are members of the St. Louis commission, the latter was represented by J. A. J. Schultz, L. L. Culver, Lawrence O. Branch, H. S. Tuttle, H. R. Todd, Edward S. Lewis, John P. Camp, Charles E. Whitman, L. E. Dennis, C. A. Cour, Tom L. Cannon, J. H. Keatnor and W. H. Moore, all of St. Louis.  The Kansas City contingent included the following in addition to those who are named as members of the state commission: C. D. Parker, Hugh J. McGowan, W. P. Trickett, A. R. Davidson, M. C. Ross, George C. Hale, H. W. Evans, George T. Lynn, R. G. Weber, J. R. Mercer, S. B. Stokeley, J. P. Britt, Fred S. Bullene, L. W. Shouse, F. D. Crabbs, O. W. Philbrook, J. K. Burnham and C. C. Ripley.  The other members of the party were A. W Warren of St Joseph and Clifford Barr of Montrose.</p>

                            <p>After everybody had been made acquainted with every other body President Wattles mounted a chair in the rotunda of the hotel and gave the visitors a brief outline of the exposition and what they might expect to see at the grounds.  He called their attention to the fact that the exposition in course of preparation is not to be an Omaha affair, nor a Nebraska show, but is a great exposition of the resources of the great transmississippi region which was originated by an organization composed of delegates from Missouri, as well as the other transmississippi states.  He said the people of Omaha and Nebraska have done all they can do to make the affair a success and they look to the people of the other transmississippi states to lend their assistance.</p>
                            <p>By this time special cars were at the door and the visitors were soon inside of them.  When the grounds were reached the party alighted and entered the main court.  President Wattles explained the names and purposes of each of the main buildings, pointing them out from the east end of the lagoon, and the whole party then made a circuit of the main court, visiting the staff shop in the Mines building and going inside of the other buildings.  The bluff tract was visited and the visitors were shown the north tract.</p>
                            <p>Like all the other visiting delegations, the Missourians expressed considerable surprise at the advanced stage of the preparations and the evident magnitude of the undertaking.  They admit without reserve that they had not expected to see preparations on such a grand scale and they complimented the management very highly on the beauty of the buildings.</p>
                            <p>After looking over the grounds thoroughly the cars were boarded for the return trip and the party reached the hotel about 1 o'clock, where it was entertained at lunch by the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>It was evident before going out to the grounds that many of the visitors had reached a point of enthusiasm regarding the exposition and some of the most influential members of the delegation expressed in the strongest terms the determination of the Missouri people to have an exhibit at the exposition which will make the other states look well to their laurels.</p>

                            <p>G. A. Atwood of Springfield, chairman of the committee on horticulture of the state commission, was especially strong in his declaration that his state would have an extensive and interesting exhibit, especially in fruits of all kinds.  Mr. Atwood is the editor and publisher of The Southwest, the only paper in the west devoted entirely to fruit interests, and he said his committee is now arranging for an exhibit of fruits that will eclipse anything that any other section can do.  "Our state is destined to be the orchard of the world," said Mr. Atwood, with the conviction of a man who knows.  "We have 20,000,000 fruit trees in <choice><sic>th esouthern</sic><corr>the southern</corr></choice> part of our state which will all be in full bearing within the next ten years, and with these we will be the great fruit producing section in the world.  We have now immense numbers of fruit trees of all varieties and produce immense quantities of fruits every year.  We don't have to irrigate and have never had a crop failure.  We are coming to the exposition within a display which will be a superior one and we are determined not to be outdone in that line by any other section of the country."</p>
                            <p>C. M. Manker of Webb City, a member of the committee on mining exhibits of the state commission, said the mining industries of Missouri will be represented by an extensive exhibit that will show to the world the immense resources of the state in that line.  "We rely largely on our lead and zinc mines," said Mr. Manker, "and we will have a fine lot of samples of these ores, the finished products and other things in that line, but we will also have a fine showing of the other minerals of our state, including silicates, pyrites, etc."</p>
                            <p>M. V. Carroll, secretary of the state commission, said the state would furnish all the stone that is required for Missouri's portion of the Arch of States.  "We have all kinds of stone and can furnish it at any time and in any quantity.  We have plenty of red sandstone or any other variety that may be wanted.  As soon as we find out how much your architects want we will send it right along.</p>
                            <p>"I want to say right here," said Mr. Carroll, emphatically, "that your commissioner, Mr. R. W. Richardson, has simply set our state afire.  We were rather apathetic about the exposition and were not inclined to do much towards making an exhibit, but he came down there and stirred our people up and now they are up in arms and we will have one of the finest exhibits that the state has ever made anywhere, and that is saying a great deal.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PRIVATE SUBSCRIPTIONS COME.</head>
                            <p>"We have no legislative appropriation for an exhibit," continued Mr. Carroll, "but we will have a fund raised by private subscriptions that will give plenty of money for all expenses that are necessary.  Our people are not niggardly and there is no fear but that the money will be forthcoming.  An appeal has just been sent out all over the state, asking the people to contribute and the returns will soon commence coming.  Our commission is well organized and we have some of the strongest men in the state as members.  The people in charge of the exposition may depend on Missouri making a showing that will be a credit to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>C. D. Parker of Kansas City, chairman of the committee on manufactures of the Commercial club, to which committee the matter of erecting a Kansas City building at the exposition has been referred, said the building project is still in statu quo, awaiting the decision of the state commission.  "We are going to co-operate <unclear/> with the state commission <unclear/></p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The Missouri Exposition commissioners came, they say, but, unlike the immortal Rome, they were conquered&#8212;conquered b<unclear/>sippi and International Exposition is to be all that its name implies.  They came on a mission of inquiry and they were inspired by what they saw.  They came with the idea that their state might, possibly, take some part in the exposition in order that it might not be said that Missouri was not represented, but they went away singing the praises of Omaha and the exposition and declaring that not only would the state be represented by an exhibit which should overshadow that of every other state in the union, but that Missouri would expend at least $50,000 in making a display that would be creditable not alone to the state, but to the exposition in which they assumed a full partnership interest.  A business meeting of the commissions was held before leaving Omaha and it was decided that a state building costing at least $10,000 should be erected and also another building in which will be exhibited a collective exhibit from every county in the state, showing the agricultural, horticultural and other resources of each county, the building to be erected of Missouri pine and to be itself an exhibit of one of the resources of the state.</p>
                            <p>The entire party returned home last night and before leaving each member of the delegation expressed again and again his hearty interest in the exposition and his determination to do his utmost, upon his return home, to arouse the enthusiasm of his neighbors to the pitch his own ideas had attained.</p>

                            <head type="sub">REPRESENTATIVE MEN COME.</head>
                            <p>The delegation arrived in the city yesterday on two Burlington trains, one section of the party coming from Kansas City and the other from St. Louis, with many additions from intermediate points.  Immediately upon their arrival the visitors went direct to the Millard hotel, where they took breakfast and where they were met a little later by the reception committee appointed to look after their comfort.</p>
                            <p>The Missouri Exposition commission is represented by Clark H. Sampson, president, of St. Louis; G. A. Atwood, third vice president, of Springfield; F. E. Marshall, treasurer, of St. Louis; M. V. Carroll, secretary, of Jefferson City; F. M. Sterrett, assistant secretary, of St. Louis; E. T. Abbott, F. W. Maxwell, R. M. Davis, A. J. Fleming, of St. Joseph; J. H. Hedgpeth of Rockport, John F. Richards, Phil E. Mullins, W. W. Morgan and George W. Fuller of Kansas City; J. N. Ballard of Montrose, W. H. Allen of Clinton, C. C. Davidson of El Dorado Springs, J. W. Baldwin and J. N. Dalby of Sedalia, J. D. Tolson of Fayette, H. W. Ewing of Jefferson City; H. A. Blossom, P. J. Toomey, W. H. Phelps, C. P. Walbridge of St. Louis; J. H. Berkshire of Winona, C. A. Emery of Carthage, John H. Taylor of Joplin and C. M. Manker of Webb City.  In addition to the St. Louis members of the state commission, nearly all of whom are members of the St. Louis commission, the latter was represented by J. A. J. Schultz, L. L. Culver, Lawrence O. Branch, H. S. Tuttle, H. R. Todd, Edward S. Lewis, John P. Camp, Charles E. Whitman, L. E. Dennis, C. A. Cour, Tom L. Cannon, J. H. Kentnor and W. H. Moore, all of St. Louis.  The Kansas City contingent included the following in addition to those who are named as members of the state commission: C. D. Parker, Hugh J. McGowan, W. P. Trickett, A. R. Davidson, M. C. Ross, George C. Hale, H. W. Evans, George T. Lynn, R. G. Weber, J. R. Mercer, S. B. Stokeley, J. P. Britt, Fred S. Bullene, L. W. Shouse, F. D. Crabbs, O. W. Philbrook, J. K. Burnham and C. C. Ripley.  The other members of the party were A. W Warren of St Joseph and Clifford Barr of Montrose.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GO TO THE GROUNDS.</head>
                            <p>After everybody had been made acquainted with every other body President Wattles mounted a chair in the rotunda of the hotel and gave the visitors a brief outline of the exposition and what they might expect to see at the grounds.  He called their attention to the fact that the <choice><sic>exposiion</sic><corr>exposition</corr></choice> in course of preparation is not to be an Omaha affair, nor a Nebraska show, but is a great exposition of the resources of the great transmississippi region which was originated by an organization composed of delegates from Missouri, as well as the other transmississippi states.  He said the people of Omaha and Nebraska have done all they can do to make the affair a success and they look to the people of the other transmississippi states to lend their assistance.</p>
                            <p>By this time special trains of street cars were in readiness and the visitors were soon inside of them.  When the grounds were reached the party alighted and entered the main court.  President Wattles explained the names and purposes of each of the main buildings, pointing them out from the east end of the lagoon, and the whole party then made a circuit of the main court, visiting the staff shop in the Mines building and going inside of the other buildings.  The bluff tract was visited and the visitors were shown the north tract.</p>
                            <p>Like all the other visiting delegations, the Missourians expressed considerable surprise at the advanced stage of the preparations and the evident magnitude of the undertaking.  They admit without reserve that they had not expected to see preparations on such a grand scale and they complimented the management very highly on the beauty of the buildings.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">BANQUET THE MISSOURIANS.</head>
                            <p>After looking over the grounds thoroughly the cars were boarded for the return trip and the party reached the hotel about 1 o'clock, where it was entertained at lunch by the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>The party was seated in the main dining room of the Millard, a long table running the full length of the room and a shorter table, at which were seated the officers of the visiting delegation and of the exposition management and Mayor Moores, extending across the room at right angles to the first table.  A delicious menu was served in a highly satisfactory manner and when the cigars were lighted President Wattles rapped the assembly to order and the post prandial exercises proceeded in an informal manner.</p>
                            <p>The president referred in a happy strain to the propriety of the largest and most populous of the transmississippi states being represented by such a large and influential delegation, and called upon Mayor F. E. Moores to extend to the visitors a welcome to the city.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Moores said the people on this side of the river extended the glad hand of welcome to their guests from the other side.  He complimented the delegation upon its size and appearance.  He confessed to a friendly feeling for Missourians because of the fact that he had lived in Kansas City for about a year at one time in his existence.  The mayor then referred to the exposition, saying that it would be impossible to outrival the World's fair in some respects, but he promised that the Transmississippi and International Exposition would be on a broad plan that will surprise all visitors to the city.  In conclusion the mayor extended to the visitors the freedom of the city.</p>
                            <p>Clark H. Sampson of St. Louis, chairman of the Missouri commission, was called on by the toastmaster to respond on behalf of the visitors, and he made a straightforward, business-like talk which carried strong conviction in every sentence.  In substance he spoke as follows:</p>
                            <p>"The members of the Missouri delegation appreciate the expressions of friendship we have heard for imperial Missouri.  We come here as to the gateway of the vast empire of the west.  The growth of this city is one of the wonders of the nineteenth century and no more fitting place could have been found for the great exposition which is destined to exhibit to the world the vast resources of this prosperous section.  We of Missouri take just pride in what you have accomplished toward this exposition, because we are Americans and Omaha is a typical American city.</p>
                            <p>"We came here expecting to see signs of progress; we have seen the pictures and reading matter which you have sent out in advertisement of your exposition, but we did not expect to see the great things you have accomplished.  We have seen what is a guaranty that the exposition will be a success and an honor not only to Omaha but to the entire American continent.  You are doing your work nobly and it behooves us to see what we can do to make the exposition the success we have determined it shall be.  We come from a state whose resources are excelled by no other.  Our resources in minerals, agriculture, horticulture and products of the soil and factory are unsurpassed and we can make a display that will reflect credit on our state and on the exposition.  It is the purpose of our commission to do our utmost to this end and it is our hope that our people will contribute of their abundance sufficient to not only make an exhibit such as I have mentioned but to build a home at the exposition for Missourians of which they may be proud and which shall be a credit to the beautiful grounds you are preparing.  I shall return to my home thoroughly enthused and I believe that we cannot do otherwise than having our state so represented that it will be a credit to our people and to the exposition."</p>

                            <p>"Impressions of Our Visit" was the sentiment to respond to which President Wattles called on F. A. Faxton of Kansas City, but Mr. Faxton had been called out temporarily and W. C. Scarritt of Kansas City was called for by some of his colleagues.  Mr. Scarritt made his remarks somewhat brief, complimenting the enterprise and courage which he said had been required to carry out such a gigantic affair as the exposition in the face of the depression which had enveloped the country.  He said the people of Kansas City contingent for the courtesy and attention which they had received since their arrival in Omaha.</p>

                            <p>"The Objects and Purposes of the Exposition" was the topic assigned to John L. Webster.  He referred eloquently and practically to the benefits which will accrue to the entire transmississippi section through the exposition and illustrated his point by a remark made by one of the visitors, who had stated that the value of land in one of the counties in Missouri would be increased $5 per acre if the county took advantage of the opportunity offered by the exposition.  He described in an eloquent manner the way in which the tide of commerce would be influenced by the great exposition of the resources of the west, pouring into the lap of these broad valleys the vast wealth of the world.</p>
                            <p>Ex-Mayor C. P. Walbridge, chairman of the St. Louis commission, was called on to tell "What the Fourth City in the United States Will Do."  He said: "I take it, Mr. Chairman, that we have not been invited here to display Missouri eloquence or to hear a eulogy of St. Louis pronounced by one of her citizens.  We have not come here as aliens or as friendly allies of a neighboring commonwealth, but as co-workers in an enterprise which is for the common good.  We have come to accept your kindly proffer of partnership in this great undertaking and to assume the full responsibility which this entails.  We will tell our people not only of the courtesies we have received, but we will tell them that the work on this enterprise you have established not only equals but excels the entrancing beauties of the great white city of Chicago.  We shall tell them that it is worthy of their best efforts and worthy of all they can do to take part in every way."</p>
                            <p>George W. Fuller was called on to speak of "Kansas City's Part."  He spoke very briefly, saying the citizens of Omaha merit the hearty co-operation and support of every state in this region.  He said the Missouri commission had been appointed about twenty days ago and the members were here on a mission of inquiry.</p>
                            <p>R. W. Richardson, the special commissioner of the exposition to Missouri, was called on to speak of "Our Guests."  He made a short, but eloquent talk, reviewing his recent trip to the state in the interest of the exposition, and referring in terms of praise to the courteous treatment he had received on every hand.  In closing he addressed himself to the visitors as follows:</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">FULL OF ENTHUSIASM.</head>
                            <p>"I trust your visit here, the knowledge and information you have gained will be a new and renewing inspiration that you may carry back to your state; that it may permeate every department of your work; that it may have magic to exercise such unbounded enthusiasm as will consume the grand old city of St. Louis like an electric spark; then sweep the angle of the Mississippi and Missouri; set the sturdy Teutons of St. Charles in motion; stand like "Hannibal" before the gates of the Tunic City; then from border to border, burn like a retort in the "queen city of the northwest," that "there might be a hot time in that old town;" ring out like a fire bell in the night in the majestic city of the Kaw; scale the walls of Jasper, magnetize the metallic cities, murmur 'neath the classic shades and limpid streams, amid the roses of fair Carthage, circle the zenith city of the Ozarks, where King Cotton, King Corn and red apples hold high carnival in friendly commerce, and wave through the vast forests of the southeast, settle like a searchlight on the dome of the capitol and illumine the central cities, bedecking the bosom of your heaven-blessed commonwealth.  Catch the inspiration of the rising tide of prosperity in this new year.  Come up to this congress of states in great companies with your caravans laden with frankincense and myrrh and aloes, the products of your fields, your mines and your commerce.  Make Missouri matchless and resplendent in this galaxy of progressive states that you may receive the commendation of her people and have her praises sounded from the Klondike to the jetties, and from Port Arthur to the zenith city of the unsalted seas."</p>
                            <p>Colonel John Doniphan of St. Joseph, the vice president of the exposition for Missouri, was called on by President Wattles, but excused himself from making a talk by saying that he had arisen from a sick couch to come to Omaha.  He reviewed the work he had done in connection with the exposition in spreading the news throughout his state and expressed the conviction that the state would take advantage of the opportunity offered to display its resources.  He said he concurred in all that had been said and believed the exposition will be a great success.</p>
                            <p>Manager Edward Rosewater was called on by the president to tell about the work that has been done in bringing the exposition to its present status.  Mr. Rosewater, in opening, paid a graceful tribute to St. Louis as a city of magnificent private residences and then took up the subject of the exposition.  He said the enterprise is designed to represent the resources of the great empire of the west and he declared it would be an anomaly if the great empire state of the west is not present.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">SCOPE OF THE EXPOSITION.</head>
                            <p>Referring to the scope of the exposition, Mr. Rosewater said that at the World's fair the greatest attention had been paid to foreign exhibits, but in the Transmississippi and International Exposition the resources of the great states of the west and of the whole United States would be given precedence.  He reviewed some of the difficulties which had beset the pathway of the promoters of the exposition during its early stages, but said the affair has now attained a solid condition and is broadening more and more every day.  He informed the visitors that five foreign nations have taken official action toward being represented and others are more than likely to follow.  Evidences of interest in the enterprise are daily being received from the most remote corners of the earth, and many of the eastern states in this country are manifesting increasing interest in the matter of official representation.  Mr. Rosewater detailed the steps that have been taken in each of the eastern states and those that are under consideration.  He also referred to the interest which is being taken in the matter by the federal government, and spoke of the advertisement the exposition is receiving from the issue of special postage stamps, the appropriation for an Indian exhibit and other governmental agencies, which had never before been exerted in the interest of any exposition.  In closing, he expressed the hope that the people of Missouri will come to the exposition in full force.</p>
                            <p>M. V. Carroll of Jefferson City, secretary of the Missouri commission and state labor commissioner, was called for and he expressed himself very briefly.  "We are glad to be here," said Mr. Carroll.  "I know that every member of our delegation will says that what he has seen has exceeded his expectations.  I can say for myself that I have read your literature and have seen the pictures you have been sending out, but I had no adequate conception of the magnitude of the enterprise.  We are proud of Missouri and want to make you people proud of it.  I am satisfied that the impressions we will take home will redound to the credit of our state and be a credit to your exposition.  We can raise the funds to erect a building and install an exhibit that will throw all others in the shade.  I do not want to discourage any other state in the efforts it may be making to get up an exhibit, but Missouri will eclipse them all."</p>
                            <p>Following the remarks of Secretary Carroll, Chairman Sampson of the Missouri commission said he was pleased to hear the secretary express himself so emphatically, as the bulk of the work must fall upon him and his inclination would go a long way toward deciding upon the nature of the exhibit and of Missouri's participation.  Mr. Sampson also declared his firm conviction that if the members of the legislature had understood the situation as the visitors now understood it there would have been a liberal appropriation.  He also stated that Governor Stephens is most enthusiastic in the work and is doing everything in his power to make the exposition a success.  In closing Mr. Sampson expressed the appreciation of the visitors for the courtesies which had been extended to them and said they would return home not only with a high appreciation of the city and of the project in hand, but with the highest respect for the energy and ability of those having it in charge.</p>
                            <p>It was evident before going out to the grounds that many of the visitors had reached a point of enthusiasm regarding the exposition and some of the most influential members of the delegation expressed in the strongest terms the determination of the Missouri people to have an exhibit at the exposition which will make the other states look well to their laurels.</p>
                            <p>G. A. Atwood of Springfield, chairman of the committee on horticulture of the state commission, was especially strong in his declaration that his state would have an extensive and interesting exhibit, especially in fruits of all kinds.  Mr. Atwood is the editor and publisher of The Southwest, the only paper in the west devoted entirely to fruit interests, and he said his committee is now arranging for an exhibit of fruits that will eclipse anything that any other section can do.  "Our state is destined to be the orchard of the world," said Mr. Atwood, with the conviction of a man who knows.  "We have 20,000,000 fruit trees in the southern part of our state which will all be in full bearing within the next ten years, and with these we will be the great fruit producing section in the world.  We have now immense numbers of fruit trees of all varieties and produce immense quantities of fruits every year.  We don't have to irrigate and have never had a crop failure.  We are coming to the exposition within a display which will be a superior one and we are determined not to be outdone in that line by any other section of the country."</p>
                            <p>C. M. Manker of Webb City, a member of the committee on mining exhibit of the state commission said the mining industries of Missouri will be represented by an extensive exhibit that will show to the world the immense resources of the state in that line.  "We rely largely on our lead and zinc mines," said Mr. Manker, "and we will have a fine lot of samples of these ores, the finished products and other things in that line, but we will also have a fine showing of the other minerals of our state, including silicates, pyrites, etc."</p>
                            <p>M. V. Carroll, secretary of the state commission, said that the state would furnish all the stone that is required for Missouri's portion of the Arch of States.  "We have all kinds of stone and can furnish it at any time and in any quantity.  We have plenty of red sandstone or any other variety that may be wanted.  As soon as we find out how much your architects want we will send it right along.</p>
                            <p>"I want to say right here," said Mr. Carroll, emphatically, "that your commissioner, R. W. Richardson, has simply set our state afire.  We were rather apathetic about the exposition and were not inclined to do much towards making an exhibit, but he came down there and stirred our people up and now they are up in arms and we will have one of the finest exhibits that the state has ever made anywhere<unclear/></p>

                            <p>"We have no legislative appropriation for an exhibit," continued Mr. Carroll, "but we will have a fund raised by private subscriptions that will give plenty of money for all expenses that are necessary.  Our people are not niggardly and there is no fear but that the money will be forthcoming.  An appeal has just been sent out all over the state, asking the people to contribute, and the returns will soon commence coming in.  Our commission is well organized and we have some of the strongest men in the state as members.  The people in charge of the exposition may depend on Missouri making a showing that will be a credit to the exposition.</p>
                            <p>C. D. Parker of Kansas City, chairman of the committee on manufactures of the Commercial club, to which committee the matter of erecting a Kansas City building at the exposition has been referred, said the building project is still in statu quo, awaiting the decision of the state commission.  "We are going to co-operate in <choice><sic>evry</sic><corr>every</corr></choice> way with the state commission," said Mr. Parker, "and are in full accord with Omaha on this exposition project.  We have not fully determined whether we will erect a separate building or not.  We are prepared to do so if it appears to the exposition management and to our people that that is the most desirable thing to do.  Whatever the outcome may be in that little detail, the people of our city are with Omaha heart and soul in making this exposition a success in every respect and showing to the world the tremendous resources of the great west."</p>
                            <p>C. C. Davidson of Eldorado Springs said the people of his section are very enthusiastic about the exposition.  "We want an 'Eldorado day,'" said he.  "We think we have the finest mineral springs in the world in our town, and if the exposition will give us a day we will ship carloads of this water to the exposition and give everybody their fill of our specialty.  Our town is ready to make an appropriation to carry this scheme into effect and the mayor authorized me to make the arrangements if the exposition management sees fit to set aside a day for the purpose.  If this is done our people will come here in force and water will be given to everybody."</p>

                            <p>After the festivities in the dining room had been concluded the members of the Missouri commission assembled in the office of the Nebraska Exposition commission and held a business meeting which was a decidedly animated proceeding.  The Missourians were full of enthusiasm and they dispatched the business before them with a celerity that accomplished results in a very short time.</p>
                            <p>The general subject of ways and means formed the matter for discussion in the beginning, but it was soon decided that an effort should at once be made to raise at least $50,000 with which to cover the expenses of state participation.  It was the consensus of opinion that <choice><sic>tihs</sic><corr>this</corr></choice> amount could be raised without any great difficulty by private contributions among the people of the state.</p>
                            <p>This part of the business disposed of, it was decided that a state building should be erected on the exposition grounds and it was decided that $10,000 should be expended for this purpose, or as much more as may be necessary to erect a creditable structure.  In addition to this building it was determined that, if it is deemed advisable to do so, a separate building shall be erected in which each county will be given space for a county collective exhibit, the building to be constructed of Missouri pine and to be of size necessary to fulfill its purpose.</p>
                            <p>The question of having separate buildings erected by the principal cities in the state was taken up and discussed and it was the sentiment of the meeting that this should not be done, but that all of the cities should co-operate with the state commission in a state building and exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Resolutions were adopted extending the thanks of the visitors to the exposition management for the generous treatment extended and to the railroads for courtesies extended in transportation and entertainment.</p>
                            <p>A special committee of seven commissioners was appointed to confer with the exposition management regarding arrangements for space and other details connected with state participation.  This meeting was held at once and an understanding arrived at in short order.  Terms that were perfectly satisfactory to both sides were agreed on and the visitors promised to co-operate in every way with the exposition management in making the affair a complete success.</p>
                            <p>The St. Louis members of the party left for their homes at 7:30 p. m. and the other members of the party took the 10 o'clock train.</p>
                            <p>Before going to the train State Labor Commissioner M. V. Carroll, secretary of the Missouri commission, reiterated his expressions of pleasure at the treatment that had been accorded the delegation.  "It is the unanimous decision of our entire party," said Mr. Carroll, "that we were never treated so well and we are more than pleased at the situation as regards the exposition.  It exceeds our expectations in every way and we are greatly pleased at the result of this visit.  There is no question whatever about the ability of our commission to raise the $50,000 we have set out to raise.  We will raise that amount beyond any doubt and I have no hesitancy in saying that we will have more than that amount to enable our resources to be exhibited to the millions of people who will visit your exposition."</p>

                            <head type="sub">GOOD WEATHER FAVORS THE ARTISANS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Magnificent Palaces Give a Faint Impression of the Grandeur and Architectural Beauty of the Finished Effect.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The exposition grounds are the center of attraction on Sundays for people of all classes and hundreds of visitors are to be seen walking to and fro on all parts of the grounds, inspecting the progress that is being made on the buildings and gaining an understanding of the general arrangement of the various points of interest.  The construction has reached a stage where there is more than a parsing interest in watching the development of the beautiful buildings which are being erected.  This is especially true of the main court, where the magnificent palaces which are to form the principal portion of the imposing ensembles are rapidly taking on form and even now give a faint impression of the grandeur and architectural beauty of the finished effect.</p>
                            <p>The weather with which a gracious Providence has favored this section during the last thirty days has served to hasten the construction and the building contractors have taken the fullest advantage of the opportunity thus offered to push the buildings.  The same sun which has made it possible for the staff contractors to plaster the outside walls of the main buildings has also softened the frozen earth and made walking rather uncomfortable, the mud being strongly in evidence all over the grounds, except close to the north side of the buildings.  This unpleasantness, however, has had but little perceptible effect on the number of visitors.  The people go to the grounds prepared to encounter the mud and no complaints are heard.</p>
                            <p>The Machinery and Electricity building is forging ahead rapidly and is nearing completion, with the <choice><sic>indictations</sic><corr>indications</corr></choice> strongly in favor of it being the first building to be entirely finished.  The carpenter work on the outside is finished and the roof is nearly completed.  The carpenter work on the inside is waiting on the plastering, which is well advanced.  The staff contractors have nearly finished the exterior of the building and are putting up the ornamental staff work which is designed for the interior.  The huge columns which support the galleries and roof, as well as the smaller columns, are to be covered with staff in ornamental designs, which will add very materially to the appearance of the interior.  The plastering on the exterior of this building is nearly finished, including the central pavilion, which is to be crowned with a group of statuary of heroic size.  All that remains to be done of the exterior staff work are the balustrade around the portico and a few minor details.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">SOME PROMINENT FEATURES.</head>
                            <p>The Manufactures and Administration building have been in a state bordering on completion for several weeks and little remains to be done on either, but it cannot be said that they are entirely completed.</p>
                            <p>The Mines building is receiving considerable attention at the hands of the staff contractors and the marble-like exterior covering is rapidly hiding from view the rough framework which forms the skeleton of the big structure.  The staff is nearly all in place on the west wing of the building up to the cornice and little surface is left for the plaster finish.  On the east wing the staff is well advanced up to the cornice line.  The west end is practically finished and work is to be commenced at once on the east end.  Some of the staff decoration on the roofs of the small flat domes on the corner pavilions has been put in place and little touches of staff here and there along the balustrade above the cornice give an idea of the beauty of the finished building.  The tall central pavilion remains untouched, but the decoration prepared for it gives promise of making this feature of the building the most prominent in decoration as well as in height.</p>
                            <p>The carpenter work on the Agriculture building is almost finished and the scaffolding for the staff workers is erected on the front and ends.  The placing of the staff on this building will be commenced this morning and will be pushed.  The staff ornamentation is completed and ready to be nailed in place.  There is little carpenter work to be done until after the interior plastering is finished.  A few men are employed in hanging doors and putting the window sashes in place, finishing the stairways, galleries, etc.</p>
                            <p>The carpenter work on the Liberal Arts building has been completed for two or three weeks and the building has been waiting for some adjustment of the staff contract.  This contract was originally let to John L. Nelson &amp; Bro. of Chicago.  They made no attempt to start work until about a month ago, when a representative of the firm came here and made arrangements for putting up a temporary shop.  At the same time he renewed negotiations, through a former employe of the exposition, to transfer the contract to other parties.  The other contractors on the grounds refused to take the contract, but through the efforts of the ex-employe referred to, Alexander &amp; Son of Memphis, staff contractors for the Government building, consented to take it and the transfer was authorized by the executive committee.  Two men are now at work in the staff shop preparing models for the staff decoration and the contractor states that he will push the work rapidly and will have the building completed within a short time.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PUSHING WORK ON ART HALL.</head>
                            <p>The Art building is beginning to show the beauties which the architects' drawings have warranted the public in expecting.  The east section of the twin building is well advanced and the raising of the roof trusses was commenced yesterday morning.  The side galleries are nearing completion and already give a good idea of the very complete arrangement of this building.  The long timbers required for the west section only arrived yesterday, having been about three months on the road.  As soon as they were received an extra force of men was put to work and Superintendent Barwick promises that the building will be pushed to an early completion.</p>
                            <p>The Government building is gradually assuming form.  The side walls of the wings are all erected and partly "sheeted."  The change in the size of the building, necessitating the extension of the wings thirty-three feet, has made it necessary to take down the end walls and move them back the required distance, filling in the intervening space.  This work is now being done, but has been the cause of some delay.  Work on the central portion of the building, including the dome, is going along slowly.</p>
                            <p>The colonnades extending from the Administration arch on either side to the Mines and Agriculture buildings are nearly finished, as far as the carpenter work is concerned, and the staff contractor will soon begin to add the decorative features.</p>
                            <p>Over on the bluff tract the Illinois building is making good progress.  The main walls are nearly all in place and some idea may now be obtained of the size of the building.</p>
                            <p>The heavy timbers for the Horticulture building have now arrived on the grounds and work on the superstructure of this building will commence at once.  The other material required in the construction of this handsome building is at hand and the contractor promises that there shall be no delay in pushing the work.</p>

                            <head type="sub">No Such Word as Fail in the State's Vocabulary.</head>
                            <ab>St. Louis Republic.</ab>
                            <p>Imperial Missouri is a good name to conjure with, and the Missouri and Omaha Exposition Commission committee is justified in conjuring with it for the purpose of insuring a creditable Missouri exhibit at the Transmississippi and International Exposition opening in Omaha June 1 next.</p>
                            <p>State pride demands that Missouri, the fifth state in the union and closely bound by trade connections with all the vast territory to be represented at Omaha, should make a showing commensurate with her natural standing.  There will be cause for shame if this is not done, and good Missourians do not like to be ashamed for their state.</p>
                            <p>There are 3,000,000 Missourians&#8212;700,000 of whom live in St. Louis&#8212;and they are nearly all good Missourians, not even barring republicans from this classification.  The blush of shame mantling the cheeks of so many Missourians at the same time would practically incarnadine the entire west with the hue of mortified embarrassment.  It would tinge even the sky of Omaha, where would be found the cause of this shaming of a state.  It will not do to have such a thing occur.</p>
                            <p>The committee in charge of Missouri's share of the Omaha exposition suggests a way out of the difficulty.  It calls for voluntary subscriptions to overcome and offset the legislature's unfortunate failure to appropriate funds sufficient for a suitable exhibit.  It names the banker in St. Louis to whom such subscriptions should be forwarded.  This places the matter entirely in the hands of loyal and state-respecting Missourians.  And there are nearly 3,000,000 of them.  What are they going to do about it?</p>

                            <head type="sub">MINISTERS ON EXPOSITION AND PRESS</head>
                            <head type="sub">One Should Be Closed on Sunday and the Other Should Be Disciplined On Account of Its Levity.</head>
                            <p>The ministerial union held its regular meeting at Kountze Memorial Lutheran church this morning, Rev. Alexander Gilchrist presiding.  The committee headed by Rev. F. A. Warfield, selecting to investigate the subject of Sunday closing at the exposition grounds, made a report in which it was stated that nothing had been accomplished.  It was said that the exposition directory had declined to confer with the committee at the present time but might be led to consider the subject later on.</p>
                            <p>The handing on of the report provoked a discussion of the matter by nearly every one present.  The majority of the speakers were in favor of the union declaring itself at once with a view <choice><sic>o fcondemning</sic><corr>of condemning</corr></choice> the course of the exposition officials.  Rev. T. J. Mackay, however, was not in favor of taking such sweeping action.  He said that a great many people would be brought to the city by the railroads on Sunday, and that he could see no objections to their enjoying the sights of the big show, provided the Midway and machinery were shut down, as it was at the World's Columbian Exposition.  He said it was a well known fact that the two theaters of the city were allowed to run Sundays, also many beer gardens and other resorts <choice><sic>o fless</sic><corr>of less</corr></choice> reputable character.  He did not understand why the Ministerial union should make a special fight on the exposition while the greater evils were allowed to go unmolested.  Various motions for the body to take action in the matter were lost, and a motion to continue the committee with directions to investigate the subject more thoroughly was passed.</p>
                            <p>At this point Dr. S. Wright Butler rose to take exceptions to reports made in the local papers as to the attitude he took in connection with a greased pig contest, which was to have taken place upon a Sunday at the exposition grounds.  He said he had been misrepresented and misquoted on the subject, and that he thought the liberty of the press should be curtailed so far as admittance to the sessions of the Ministerial union was concerned.  He was seconded in a short speech by Rev. J. K. Paulson, who thought the meetings of the body should be private.  Rev. J. O. Staples was of the opinion that ministers in general owed much to the courtesy of the press in publishing their various proceedings, notices and sermons, and that the motion might be construed in the light of an insult if <choice><sic>carriedl</sic><corr>carried</corr></choice>.  On vote, <choice><sic>th emotion</sic><corr>the motion</corr></choice> was turned down.</p>

                            <head type="sub">EXTENSION OF COURTESY BY RAILROADS</head>
                            <head type="sub">Free Transportation of Exhibits Offered Superintendent Jackson, Who Has Formulated a Plan for the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>The list of articles for exhibition at the exposition which the railroads of Nebraska have agreed to transport to and from points in the state without making any charge therefor has been increased by the addition of all educational exhibits which are under the direction of State Superintendent Jackson.  This is regarded by those having the matter in charge as a most important concession and it is believed that it will assure an exhibit of Nebraska's educational resources which could be secured in no other way.  Manager Babcock of the Transportation department and Assistant Secretary Dearing of the Nebraska Exposition commission have been bending every energy to secure this concession from the Nebraska roads, and the announcement from railway headquarters that the roads had agreed to add the educational exhibits to the list was received with great rejoicing.  The roads agreed some time ago to transport all agricultural and horticultural exhibits to and from all points in the state to the exposition without making any charge and the concession now made practically covers everything that will be exhibited by Nebraskans except live stock.</p>
                            <p>With this impetus Superintendent Jackson expresses the greatest confidence that Nebraska will stand in the front rank in the educational department, as there is no reason why every district in the state should not be represented by its very best work.  With free space and free transportation nothing remains to be done by the schools of the state but to prepare their exhibits, and this work is already well advanced.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="199" xml:id="TMISB03-199"/>
                            
                            <p>The plan formulated by Superintendent Jackson provides that the schools in each county must send exhibits to their county superintendent at the county seat.  From there all the exhibits of each county will be sent directly to Omaha where the force under the direction of Superintendent Jackson will take them in charge and see to their placing.</p>
                            <p>The generosity of the railroads is especially gratifying to the officials of the University of Nebraska, as the exhibit to be made by that institution is quite extensive and the cost of transportation has been a most serious consideration with Chancellor MacLean.  With this embargo removed the university will be enabled to make a showing which will be highly gratifying to those concerned.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Exposition Derives Great Notoriety Through the Proposed Issue.</head>
                            <p>The amount of advertising the exposition is receiving from the special postage stamp to be issued by the federal government is already reaching colossal proportions.  Every newspaper in the country has published one or more articles regarding it in its telegraph columns, and nearly all of them have commented on it editorially.  The Associated Press has sent references to the stamps all over the country from time to time, and a full description of them was sent out in this way as soon as the department decided on the designs.  Some of the papers have opposed the idea of a special issue, among the latter being the Chicago News, which devotes a full page of a recent issue to illustrating each of the eight stamps.  Each stamp was shown in a cut about 5x7 inches, with alleged humorous sketches showing some supposed event in transmississippi history.</p>
                            <p>In addition to this kind of advertising the sale of these stamps promises to be tremendous.  Orders are being placed for them and some of these are sent through the Department of Publicity and Promotion.  The largest of these latter is that of Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. of Chicago, a firm which does a large mail order business.  This firm has made requisition for 8,000 of the 1-cent stamps and wants them as soon as possible, with promise of more in the near future.  Other large firms are placing orders for these stamps at this early day and the name of the Transmississippi and International Exposition will soon be in everybody's mouth.</p>

                            <p>Adjutant General P. H. Barry is seeking to have the Nebraska National guard hold its annual encampment in Omaha during the exposition, and will form one of the attractions.  The adjutant general has written to President Wattles regarding his plan and has asked the exposition management to furnish certain of the camp equipage and provide some of the paraphernalia for the commissary department.</p>
                            <p>In a formal presentation by Chancellor MacLean the suggestion was made that the cadets of the University of Nebraska hold their annual encampment at Omaha this year on the dates provided by the regulation of the university, June 2, 3 and 4 was also <choice><sic>receied</sic><corr>received</corr></choice>.  The chancellor <choice><sic>suvggested</sic><corr>suggested</corr></choice> that the battalion come to Omaha June 1 and take part in the opening day exercises and parade, and then go into camp at the place provided for them.  He refers to the fact that the grounds of old Fort Omaha will probably be <choice><sic>pla ced</sic><corr>placed</corr></choice> in charge of the exposition management by the War department, and says this would form an excellent place for the camp of the cadets.  He encloses a letter from Lieutenant Stoltensburg, commandant of the cadets, who details the paraphernalia and equipment which would be required for a camp, including the equipment of a full-fledged commissary department to feed cadets while here.</p>
                            <p>These matters will be taken up at once by President Wattles and a course of action determined on.  It is probable that the course adopted by the management of the Nashville exposition in handling its military contingent will be adapted to the requirements in connection with the coming exposition so far as they will apply.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The regular monthly meeting of the Woman's Board of Managers of the Exposition convened at exposition headquarters this morning.  Four of the twenty-seven members were absent, viz.: Mrs. Button of Hastings and Mesdames Keysor, Cudahy and Martin of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>Under a rule adopted at the last meeting each of the members made a report of the work done by her since that meeting.  These reports all related to the work done toward raising funds for the Girls and Boys' building which is to be erected by the board.  Mrs. Nettie Hollenbeck of Fremont reported that she had been unable to do anything whatever in the way of raising money for this purpose.  She said the Board of Education had refused to allow the matter to be taken into the schools and she had been unable to get any of the women of her town interested sufficiently to undertake the work of raising funds in any way.  <choice><sic>Tihs</sic><corr>This</corr></choice> was the only case where nothing had been done, but in nearly every case the reports from the districts outside of Omaha and Council Bluffs were to the effect that very little had been accomplished.</p>
                            <p>In response to questions Secretary Ford reported that the total collections in the building fund amounted to $3,514.35, some of which is still in the hands of patronesses.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Harford, chairman of the executive committee, said it was evident that some other <choice><sic>meanse</sic><corr>means</corr></choice> would have to be adopted to raise the funds necessary to carry out the project of erecting a building for the mothers and the children.  She then presented the scheme which has been under consideration for some time by the executive committee, that of issuing a newspaper for the girls and boys, one issue only to be gotten out and to be circulated all over the state.  Mrs. Harford said it was hoped by this means to raise sufficient money to warrant the erection of the building.  She said it was proposed to issue an edition of 25,000 copies of a twelve-page paper, devoted to the interests of the boys and girls, printed on fine paper and illustrated in an attractive manner.  The exposition would be exploited in the paper from a standpoint of interest to the children, and articles on various subjects by some of the older children, including those in the universities, would appear in the columns.

                            <head type="sub">WOMEN WANT TO KNOW.</head>
                            <p>A very general discussion followed the presentation of this matter.  The women from the districts outside of Omaha were so many interrogation points, and they "wanted to know."  One question asked of them by Mrs. Harford was whether, in their opinion, it would be desirable to have one page in the paper devoted to each congressional district, with articles contributed by local juvenile talent and local advertising to help meet the extra expense of such an arrangement.  It took but a very few moments to return a most emphatic negative to this question, and then ensured a general discussion of the newspaper and the building.  There seemed to be great confusion in the minds of the women outside of Omaha regarding the proposed building, its cost, who is to control it, whether it is to be used exclusively for exhibits, and whether there wasn't some hidden scheme by which Omaha would derive some benefit from it.</p>
                            <p>The many questions were answered as fast as they were being asked, the gist of the discussion being that, as contemplated, the building will cost about $7,000, and about $3,000 additional will be required to purchase the pictures and other embellishments which the board has promised as awards to the schools in return for certain things to be done on their part.  This will require a fund of about $10,000, of which $3,500 has been raised, by far the greater part of this amount having been raised in Omaha and Council <choice><sic>lBuffs</sic><corr>Bluffs</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>It was further stated that the funds wherewith this building is to be erected are on deposit with the treasurer of the exposition as trustee for the woman's board and are not a part of the exposition funds; that the building will be under the control of the women's board, subject to the rules of the exposition; that that board will be responsible for the success or failure of the project and will receive the profits or make good the deficit.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Ford impressed upon the members of the board the fact that this building will be in very great demand for exhibits and lectures which are especially interesting to women, pertaining to domestic economy and kindred affairs.  She said it was practically certain that if the building could be erected it would be successful and would reflect credit upon the board from a financial standpoint and still have plenty of space for every purpose for which it is designed.</p>
                            <p>This discussion seemed to have a clearing effect on the atmosphere and an adjournment was taken for luncheon with many expressions of satisfaction but without definite action on the newspaper project, or any other means of raising funds for the building.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Subcontractor Brings in Men from the Country and Pays Less Than the Recognized Wages for the Work.</head>
                            <p>Trouble seems brewing about the Nebraska building on the exposition grounds, and organized labor in Omaha is up in arms over what the leaders denounce as a scheme on the part of the Nebraska Exposition commission to not only break faith with organized labor, but to openly countenance a reduction in the established scale of wages in violation of the action taken by the commission at its first meeting, when it is resolved, with a great flourish of trumpets, that the established scale of the labor unions in Omaha should form the basis for the payment of all men employed on the Nebraska building.</p>
                            <p>The cause of all the trouble is the subcontractor who has the job of plastering the Nebraska building.  The staff and contract on this building was let to Kimball Brothers of Lincoln, who were the lowest bidders.  The plastering was sublet to Hester &amp; McCaslin of Lincoln.  The representatives of organized labor say that the latter contractors are bringing men in from the small towns, and are paying them but 30 cents per hour, whereas the regular scale of wages for plasterers in Omaha has been 50 cents per hour for several years.  They say that this is the price being paid by all other contractors on the grounds, and they claim that it is a violation of good faith on the part of the Nebraska commission to allow such action on the part of the contractors having this work in charge.</p>
                            <p>A committee consisting of W. H. Bell, president of the Central Labor union, John Breen, president of the Plasterers' union and Matthew Clawson, president of the Building Trades council has been formed to take the matter in hand and see if the difficulty cannot be adjusted.  Messrs. Bell and Breen of this committee called on Assistant Secretary Dearing of the Nebraska commission this morning to learn if any results had grown out of a former visit to him to ask the commission to compel the contractors to pay the union scale of wages.  They met with no success, Secretary Dearing telling them that the work had been let by contract and that the commission had no control over the contractor so far as regulating wages is concerned.</p>
                            <p>After leaving the office of the state commission the two members of the committee were somewhat emphatic in expressing their disgust at the manner in which the state commission has receded from the position it took at the outset on the labor question.</p>
                            <p>President Bell says he is convinced that the action of the commission in the first instance was simply intended as a sop to organized labor, and after it had developed that the building was going to cost about $4,000 more than was originally intended, it seemed to be the intention of the commission to make the laboring men suffer for the extravagance of the commission.</p>
                            <p>"We don't ask them to employ union men or Omaha men," said Mr. Bell, "but we simply want them to pay the scale of wages in force here.  They started out to build this building by day's labor and brought in a lot of men from <choice><sic>the ecountry</sic><corr>the country</corr></choice> who were not worth the 30 cents an hour they were paid.  The result is that the building has cost more than was intended, and now they have concluded to let the rest of the work by contract.  We have no objection to that, but we insist that the state should not be the means of reducing wages on the exposition grounds when all the other contractors there are willing to pay and do pay the full scale.  They say they have no power to do anything in the matter, but we do not intend to let it rest at that. We intend going to Lincoln to have an interview with the governor and see if something cannot be done to protect the interests of the people who pay a good share of this state appropriation."</p>

                            <p>The Monday issue of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat contains the following:</p>
                            <p>The nineteen members of the St. Louis commission of the Transmississippi Exposition, who went to Omaha, Neb., on Friday, returned home yesterday evening.  All were delighted with the trip.  On arriving at Omaha the St. Louis delegation met the entire state commission&#8212;about fifty of the most prominent business men of Missouri.  All the leading commercial bodies of the state were represented.  Mr. Clark H. Sampson, ex-Mayor Walbridge and F. M. Sterrett were members of the St. Louis party.</p>
                            <p>The officers of the exposition and a reception committee received and entertained the Missourians in the most hospitable style.  The visitors were amazed at the revelation offered by the exposition grounds.  Many of the big buildings were found to be completed and painted white after the general style of the structures at the Chicago World's fair.  The great lagoon, about half a mile in length, on the borders of which the buildings are erected, is frozen just now, and thousands of the young people of Omaha are enjoying great sport skating on it.  The large buildings already completed are the United States Government, Manufactures, Machinery and Electricity, Fine Arts and Horticultural.</p>
                            <p>The whole group of buildings, including those to be erected by the different states, will cover more than 200 acres.</p>
                            <p>Many of the large cities are making exhibits independent of the states.</p>
                            <p>The St. Louisans and other visitors from Missouri were entertained at the Millard hotel, where speeches were made by President Wattles of the exposition, Mayor Moores of Omaha, Clark H. Sampson, ex-Mayor Walbridge and others.  The local commissioners feel confident that the people of St. Louis and Missouri will heartily co-operate with them in making a thorough exhibit of the state's educational, industrial and natural resources.  Chairman Walbridge will this week issue a call for a meeting, to which representatives of the manufacturing and commercial bodies will be invited to consider and adopt plans for a proper exhibit.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Director Wharton Spreads the Gospel of the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>Director John C. Wharton is spreading the gospel of the exposition in California, where he and his bride are spending the honeymoon.  The San Francisco papers are devoting columns of space to Mr. Wharton's business-like presentation of the main facts concerning the exposition and his neatly put insinuation that California will be very sorry if it fails to take advantage of the opportunity offered to exhibit its resources to the world through the medium of the exposition to be held at Omaha.  The San Francisco Chronicle of January 13 prints nearly a column interview with Mr. Wharton, in which he describes briefly the progress which has been made in erecting buildings and preparing for the great event.  He also tells of what other states and foreign governments have done and are doing in the way of preparing for representation.</p>
                            <p>The efforts being made by Director Wharton to arouse Californians to a sense of their own interests are being augmented by the published interviews with L. R. Hare and C. H. Holbrook, the advance agents of the Klondike car which passed through Omaha several weeks ago.  These men in telling of the trip of the car, speak in terms of praise for the exposition and give it as their unbiased opinion that the state will make a great mistake if it is not represented at Omaha this summer.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Band, Orchestra and Chorus as a Local Nucleus Around Which the Work Will Be Made Complete.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Prof. Willard Kimball, the newly elected musical director of the exposition, arrived in the city yesterday and presented to Chairman Lindsey an outline of his plan for music at the exposition.  This plan was laid before the executive committee by Mr. Lindsey and was approved, thus putting the finishing touch to the engagement of Prof. Kimball.</p>
                            <p>The musical director was seen at the Millard hotel after the decision of the executive committee and was asked regarding his plans and intentions so far as the exposition music is concerned.</p>
                            <p>"The plan I submitted to the executive committee," said Prof. Kimball, "was simply an outline plan.  It is impossible to fix the exact nature of the music to be given and the number of performances until something definite is fixed as to the amount of money that is to be available for that purpose.  I have a definite plan outlined in my mind, however, and shall endeavor to carry it out as far as I am given the opportunity.</p>
                            <p>"The first necessity in an enterprise of this kind is an organization of musicians, or, rather, two organizations.  One of these is a military band of the very first quality and the other an orchestra of the highest grade.  The band would serve to give open air concerts of a high order, do escort duty for important personages, and cater to the tastes which prefer that class of music.  The orchestra must be composed of musicians who are fully competent to carry their parts after one rehearsal for any kind of work that may be presented.  With such an organization the exposition can say to the big choral organizations in the different cities: 'We have an orchestra equal to Theodore Thomas', and we invite you to come here and give some of the standard oratorios with your own conductor.'  I also hope we will be able to say to them that we will supply the finest soloists obtainable to sing with them.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WHAT HE INTENDS TO DO.</head>
                            <p>"I also propose to appoint in each of the western states persons who will work up an interest among the local organizations and have them come to Omaha and give high class music with their own conductors.  It is not my purpose to attempt to act as conductor for the many performances which I hope we may be able to give, but I shall devote the greatest part of my time and energies to arranging for the rendition of music of the very highest grade that shall be a credit to the exposition and to the musical culture of the west.  The west is fully capable of it, and the exposition and to the musical culture of the west.  The west is fully capable of it, and the exposition will offer the finest opportunity for us to show the world what we can do.  My interest is in the west, and I am anxious to do everything that lies in my power to overcome the false impression that prevails in some quarters that we know nothing of music out here.  We can draw from Minneapolis, Chicago, Kansas City, Denver and Salt Lake and many other western cities which have excellent choral organizations, and can give a series of musical events which have never been equaled in this country.  These organizations all want to come here, and all that is necessary is for us to prepare the way for them.  Mr. Lindsey has turned over to me bushels of letters relating to these matters, and I have no doubt whatever that if we can assure these people we will furnish a good orchestra and the other things that are necessary we can make a success of that feature of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>"It will be necessary to have a chorus of about 300 voices in Omaha.  I believe this can be organized by uniting the several organizations now in existence in this city and in Council Bluffs.  Some of the smaller towns nearby may send recruits to this chorus.  I don't want any drones in this organization, but 300 people who can and will sing.  With such an organization as a basis, together with the orchestra I have referred to, we can rest assured of creditable performances.  This will give Omaha musicians the opportunity to do good work.  I hope to be able to unite them and secure their co-operation in perfecting this choral organization, so that on the opening day of the exposition we may give a grand cantata, and perhaps render some of the well known works, such as 'The Messiah,' 'Elijah' or others.</p>

                            <head type="sub">NOT AN OMAHA AFFAIR.</head>
                            <p>"It has been charged that I am not an Omaha man," continued Prof. Kimball, "and that I would work to build up the musical interests of Lincoln and not those of Omaha.  So far as the first statement is concerned if this is to be an Omaha exposition the charge might have some force, but as I take it this is to be an interstate and international exposition, and such a narrow accusation should never be heard of.  So far as building up my school in Lincoln is concerned, that is not necessary.  I propose to work for the success of the exposition and for that alone.  That will not prevent any musician in Omaha from making all he can out of it.</p>
                            <p>"I shall take up at once the work of organizing the Omaha chorus and shall devote myself to that end as vigorously as possible as soon as the movement can be started.  I shall be in Omaha frequently and shall open an office in the Paxton block as soon as I can arrange my private affairs to do so.  The engaging or organizing of the band and orchestra is another matter which will occupy my time.  I do not believe it will be necessary to bring organizations here from the outside.  I feel quite sure there are competent musicians right here in Omaha to make up the greater part of these organizations.  There may be some particular instruments which cannot be found here, but I have no <choice><sic>douobt</sic><corr>doubt</corr></choice> Omaha and Council Bluffs will be able to supply the greater part of what will be required."</p>

                            <head type="sub">L. Bradford Prince Talks About the Resources and Plans of the Territory for a General Exhibit.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>Ex-Governor L. Bradford Prince of Santa Fe, N. M., vice president of the exposition for that state and a new member of the New Mexico Exposition commission, arrived in the city this morning as the advance guard of a committee delegated to come to Omaha and make arrangements for space for an exhibit of the resources of that territory.  The other two members of the committee, Major W. H. Llewellyn and J. J. Leeson, are expected to arrive some time today.</p>
                            <p>Governor Prince is a most enthusiastic supporter of the exposition and says he hopes to have his section represented in a manner commensurate with its resources.  "We regard this exposition as the opportunity of a lifetime for our territory," said he in a conversation this morning.  "It is to be held in the very heart of the section of country from which the great bulk of our population is drawn and we believe we can derive more benefit from participation in this exposition than from any exposition that has been held in the country.  Our legislature made but a small appropriation, only $1,300, and we will endeavor to supplement this by private contributions, to enable a good showing to be made.</p>
                            <p>"We will make a good showing on agricultural products and will probably surprise some people who have not looked into our resources.  At Chicago we took the first prize in competition with the world on wheat and were awarded the prize for the best oats in competition with all sections in America.  Horticulture is our strongest point, however.  We raise all the temperate zone fruits, from apricots and plums to winter apples.  We will also make a fine showing on sugar beets.  I realize that Nebraska is a suger-producing state, but when I say that our beets grave very high I am prepared to produce the proofs.  On account of the dryness of our climate and the amount of sunshine our beets grade 22 per cent, which is a very high percentage.</p>
                            <p>"In minerals we will make a fine showing with the specimens from our turquoise mines, the only ones in the United States, and the finest mines in the world.  We will also show gold, silver, copper and lead and other commercial ores."</p>

                            <p>The North Dakota Exposition commission organized at Fargo Monday of this week by electing C. A. Lounsberry of Fargo president, C. B. Little of Bismarck treasurer and J. B. Power of Power secretary.  Alfred Dickey of Jamestown was appointed general agent and special agents were authorized to be appointed in each of the districts of the state.  It was decided to ask all the railroads to co-operate with the commission in securing 10,000 feet of space in the Agricultural building and it was stated that two of the roads had already signified their willingness to assist the commission in this matter.  It was reported that much of the material collected for the World's fair is available for the state exhibit and the commission announced that a state exhibit would be prepared that will be a credit to the state.</p>
                            <p>E. L. Danforth of Minneapolis, a member of the Minnesota Exposition commission, arrived in the city today and is making himself familiar with exposition matters in general.  Governor Merriam has appointed Mr. Danforth a member of the commission and will make public today the names of the entire Minnesota commission, numbering about a dozen of the most prominent and influential business men in the North Star state.</p>

                            <p>Montana is in the lead in the matter of selecting the two handsomest young women in the state to represent the state in the composite picture which is to form the model for one side of the exposition medal.  Miss Harriett Elenear Waldorf of Dillon and Miss Leonard Robinson of Bozeman are the young women who have been selected by a special committee of newspaper men appointed by Vice President W. H. Sutherlin to decide this difficult question, and their photographs will be received at exposition headquarters in due time.  Similar proceedings are in progress in each of the transmississippi states, but Montana is the first to decide the matter.</p>
                            <p>When Manager Lindsey of the Ways and Means department sent a letter to each of the state vice presidents in the transmississippi region, asking them to select the two most beautiful young women in their respective states in order that their profiles might be incorporated in the composite picture which is to represent the concentrated beauty of the women of the great west, Vice President Sutherlin appointed five newspaper men from different sections of Montana to pass upon the beauty of the contestants.  The<unclear/></p>
                            <p>Last Saturday was the day selected for the closing of the contest and the meeting of the judges.  A telegraph dispatch from Helena printed in the Anaconda Standard of Sunday says that but three of the five newspaper men appointed on the committee to pass judgment on the delicate subject assigned to them.  These were A. K. Yerkes of the Bozeman Chronicle, G. W. Sikes of the Helena Independent and R. E. Fisk of the Helena Herald.  Vice President Sutherlin laid a large number of photographs before the judges, each bearing a number, the name corresponding to each number not being made known to the judges until after a decision had been made.</p>
                            <p>It was found that a greater part of the pictures were not profile views, as required by the rules, and these were at once laid aside and not considered.  This left but twenty-two photographs and the judges were limited to these.  On the first ballot each judge voted for a different girl.  On the second ballot Miss Waldorf received two votes and was declared elected.  Miss Robinson was selected as the second candidate on the first ballot.</p>
                            <p>The Standard correspondent says Miss Waldorf is a brunette and a native of Kentucky.  She has resided in Montana but a short time.  Miss Robinson is said to be a blonde and a native of Montana, the daughter of a Gallatin valley ranchman.  In this contest Dillon contributed five contestants, Helena four, Anaconda three, Bozeman, Great Falls and Belt two each, and Hamilton, Fort Benton, Billings and Butte one each.  The pictures of the losing contestants were returned to them at once and it will not be known who they were.  The pictures of the winners will be sent to Manager Lindsey.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Financial and Water Questions Receive Needed Consideration.</head>
                            <p>A special meeting of the board of directors of the Exposition association was held yesterday afternoon at which the financial situation was discussed and great emphasis put on the fact that the growth of the exposition project makes it imperatively necessary that strong efforts must be made to increase the subscription list in addition to adopting some practical way of compelling delinquent subscribers to pay their subscriptions.</p>
                            <p>It was decided to levy an assessment of 35 per cent, this being the full amount of stock subscribed, as 65 per cent was levied during last year.  This last assessment will be payable in two installments, 20 per cent being due February 1 and the remaining 15 per cent being due March 1.  A discount of 1 per cent will be allowed on this assessment if all is paid before February 1.</p>
                            <p>A meeting of the board will be held Saturday of this week at 4 o'clock and at this meeting each director will be furnished a list showing each subscriber of $100 or over who has not paid all of his assessments.</p>
                            <p>The water question was brought up by some of the directors who inquired as to what progress had been made.  It was stated that the committee had been waiting for the recovery of Chairman Kountze, who is confined to his home with an attack of typhoid fever and is not expected to be out for several weeks.</p>
                            <p>After some discussion it was decided to increase the water committee by adding C. W. Lyman and C. F. Manderson and instructing the committee to proceed with the negotiations with the water company and be prepared to submit a report to the meeting to be held Saturday afternoon.  Mr. Carpenter, a member of the committee, said he believed a satisfactory understanding would be had with the water company.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles named A. T. Rector, Thomas Kilpatrick and I. W. Carpenter as a special committee to meet the three members of the New Mexico Exposition commission who are expected to arrive today or tomorrow.</p>

                            <p>Reports coming to exposition headquarters indicate that the erroneous impression is gaining ground among the manufacturers of agricultural implements that the displays of these wares are to be placed by the exposition management in a lot of sheds with open sides and gravel floors.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Exhibits authorizes the statement that this impression is altogether wrong.  Plans are now drawn, and will be passed upon by the executive committee within a few days, providing a spacious and substantial building for agricultural implements.  This building will be floored the same as the other main buildings and will not be a shed in any sense of the word.</p>
                            <p>The impression referred to may have arisen from the fact that some of the implement dealers have asked about space outside of the main building in temporary sheds and this has formed the subject of consideration, but at no time has it ever been contemplated to put the general exhibit of agricultural implements in such a building as the erroneous report refers to.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Commission Appointed by Mayor Gives Details of the Structure Proposed for the Use of Colorado's Capital.</head>
                            <p>Denver is to have a building of its own on the exposition grounds.  The exposition <choice><sic>commisison</sic><corr>commission</corr></choice> appointed by the mayor of Denver has determined upon this point, and the chairman of the <choice><sic>commisison</sic><corr>commission</corr></choice> has written to the exposition management to make arrangements for the space and learn full particulars regarding other details.</p>
                            <p>It is proposed to erect a building whose most prominent feature shall be a circular center surmounted by a flat dome.  From this center will radiate four wings.  One wing will be devoted to exhibits by the Denver schools and another to the women of Denver in which they will exhibit such articles as they select.  The other wings will be devoted to reception rooms and offices.  The most striking feature of the building, however, will be the rotunda in the center.  This rotunda will be sixty feet in diameter, and it is proposed to decorate it with pictures.  The frieze will be composed of photographic views of Colorado scenery, for which a well known Denver photographer has become famous.  These pictures will be lighted from behind, and will form a unique decoration.  Below this will be a large picture extending entirely around the rotunda showing the city of Denver as seen from a central point.  In addition to these pictures there will be photographs of Denver schools, hospitals, public buildings, etc.</p>
                            <p>The chairman of the Denver Exposition commission is W. S. Ward, who has had considerable experience in exposition matters.  He was connected with the Colorado exhibit at Paris in 1889, and at the World's fair in Chicago, and is chairman of the commission appointed to represent the state in the Paris exposition of 1900.  He writes to the Department of Exhibits that the feeling in Denver is very strongly in favor of a good city and state exhibit and the Denver commission is doing all in its power to aid in securing funds for a fine state exhibit.  He says whether this is accomplished or not will have no bearing upon the erection of a building by Denver.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Contractor Making Good Headway with the Exterior Construction.</head>
                            <p>The Government building on the Exposition grounds is making rapid progress and has now reached a point where some idea may be gained of the size of the structure.  Engineer J. J. Farnan of the engineer corps of the Treasury department is in charge of the work and is pushing the construction with all possible speed.  As many men are now at work on the building as can be employed to advantage and the construction is advancing at all points.  The iron columns which are to support the dome and all of its appurtenances have arrived on the grounds and these will be put in place at once and the superstructure of the dome reared without delay.  The building is up to the cornice line all around and the work of covering the roof around the sides is progressing.  The great trusses which will span the central portion of each wing are being swung into place, the work of raising them having been commenced yesterday morning.  The lower segment of a circle, producing a pleasing effect as seen from the floor at a distance.  Mr. Farnan says that if the weather is not unfavorable the big building will be under roof by the first of the coming month.</p>
                            <p>There have been rumbles of trouble in connection with this building on account of the charge made by organized labor that the contractor has been violating the federal eight-hour law and has been employing inferior workmen and paying low wages.  It was largely on account of these complaints and the fact that the building was progressing at a very slow rate that Mr. Farnan was sent to Omaha to supervise the work.  When asked about these complaints Mr. Farnan said he found on investigation that the contractor has been working more than eight hours, but on being told that the law must be complied with in the absence of instructions to the contrary from Washington, there had been no further violations in that direction since his arrival.  Regarding the wage question, Mr. Farnan said he had no jurisdiction further than to see that no inferior work goes into the building.</p>
                            <p>Contractor Alexander, who is to do the staff work on the building, is at a standstill, as the small models for the staff work have not yet been received from Washington.  The supervising architect sends to the contractor a small model of each portion of the ornamental staff work on the building and no progress can be made until these are received.  These models are made in Washington and are passed upon by the officials in the supervising architect's office and the contractor is obliged to follow them explicitly.  Mr. Alexander says he has been ready for three weeks to commence active work, but can do nothing until the models arrive.</p>

                            <p>The executive committee of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi association held a meeting at the Grand hotel last evening, and pushed along a few steps further the business and enterprises for which the association was formed.  Two vacancies in the general committee of fifty were filled by the election of Dr. S. B. Jennings and J. C. Mitchell.  The finance committee reported the resignation of its chairman, A. W. Wyman, and E. H. Walters was elected to the position.  The committee made a report that was highly satisfactory to the association, for it indicated that the great financial problem was in a fair way of being solved.  While on the subject of finances the committee recommended the creation of subcommittees to assist in the work of soliciting funds to build the big wigwam.  It was decided to create six groups of three members each, one from the finance committee and two from the general committee.  These groups will form auxiliary soliciting committees whose chief duty will be to push the sale of the 5,000 exposition buttons that are on hand.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Judson made a report that contained a good deal of matter of general interest, especially the portions concerning the importance of the exposition to the city of Council Bluffs.  He said in part:</p>
                            <p>It has been estimated that 5,000 people can find accommodations in Council Bluffs with the extra arrangements that will be made during the exposition.  If only an average of 3,000 stop in this city during that time it will mean an expenditure to our boarding houses, hotels and lodging places and thence to our grocers, butchers, bakers, market gardeners and others of about $600,000 at the low rate of $2 per day for each person for board and lodging.  Street car fares paid for by these people would amount to $150,000 or more and personal expenditures in other ways to $200,000 more, making an aggregate of about $1,000,000.  To show that these figures are not excessive as to attendance if we can take care of 2,000 people at a time this only means 30,000 different persons at the average rate of stoppage, and the exposition authorities confidently figure on the attendance of more than 1,000,000 different visitors.  On the expenditure in our city of $1,000,000 1 per cent would be $10,000&#8212;more than enough to carry on the work of advertising, build the wigwam and leave a dividend for an auditorium fund.  It looks as though, in the face of such figures as these, that it ought not to be difficult to secure funds enough to carry on the association work.</p>
                            <p>The secretary was allowed $25 for postage for his official correspondence.  A resolution was adopted declaring that no liabilities should be incurred in the name of the association except by a vote of a majority of the members at any regular or special meeting.  The committee adjourned to meet again on next Thursday night.</p>
                            <p>An invitation was extended to all of the members of the committee to meet with the executive committee of the Merchants' and Manufacturers' association, which will hold a special session at the Grand hotel this evening for the purpose of discussing the reported rumor of the removal of the Union Pacific transfer business to Omaha.  Judge McGee will be present and will read the decree of the United States supreme court in the mandamus case that was brought against the Union Pacific company to compel it to transact its terminal business in this city.  An invitation is extended to all of the members of the Transmississippi association and other interested citizens to be present and listen to the discussions.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Illinois' Executive Anxious to Make a Good Show at Omaha.</head>
                            <p>James R. B. Van Cleave of Chicago, insurance commissioner of Illinois and inspector general of the national guard of that state, is in the city on private business and also as the representative of Governor Tanner.  He called on President Wattles, an old friend, and made careful inquiry regarding the exposition for the information of the governor.  He went out to the grounds to see the progress that is being made in the erection of the main <choice><sic>bildings</sic><corr>buildings</corr></choice> and also to look over the Illinois building.</p>
                            <p>"Governor Tanner is greatly interested in your exposition," said General Van Cleave, in speaking of the object of his visit.  "He says it is to be one of the most important events in the history of the west, and he is especially anxious to see that it is a great success and that Illinois is properly represented.  Knowing that I was coming to Omaha he asked me to represent him in certain matters in connection with the exposition, and I am complying with that request.  Governor Tanner showed his friendship for the Transmississippi Exposition when he approved the appropriation of $45,000 for state participation in face of the fact that we were compelled to borrow $250,000 in order to buy provisions for our state institutions and were heavily in debt.  He said he could better afford to bear the curses of his opponents than to be responsible for our great state being absent in one of the grandest expositions this country has ever seen.</p>
                            <p>"The governor will be here on the opening day to take part in the inaugural ceremonies," continued General Cleaves, "and he will be accompanied by his official staff and a large escort of our national guard.  We are very proud of our militia and I hope we may be able to bring several regiments as escort to the governor on that occasion."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Park Commission Opens the Offers and Refers Them.</head>
                            <p>The Board of Park Commissioners met yesterday afternoon to open the bids on the construction of the bridges across the lagoon at Twentieth street.  There were eleven bids, each accompanied by the plans on which the bid was based and as anticipated a number of bids below $10,000 were secured.  The wide range of figures is explained by the fact that each bidder prepared his own plans in accordance with a few general rules and in some cases they contemplate more pretentious construction than in others.</p>
                            <p>The bids for the construction of the two bridges with foundation and superstructure complete were: Canton Bridge company, Canton, O., $9,350; Gillette-Herzog Manufacturing company, Minneapolis, $14,000 or $11,640, two plans submitted; C. E. H. Campbell, Council Bluffs, $17,000; H. B. Mayo &amp; Co., Omaha, $12,310; Wisconsin Bridge and Iron company, Milwaukee, $13,970; Van Court &amp; Winn, Omaha, $9,950; Geisel Construction company, St. Louis, $13,300; P. H. Mahoney, Omaha, $9,764; Youngstown Bridge company, Youngstown, O., $10,000; Wrought Iron Bridge company, Canton, O., $13,500; Farnsworth &amp; Blodgett, Kansas City, $14,600.  The bids were referred to the city engineer for tabulation and the board will meet again Saturday afternoon to consider them.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="203" xml:id="TMISB03-203"/>
                            
                            <p>The board adopted a resolution asserting its right to prevent the construction of street railway tracks or the location of telephone or telegraph poles on the Nineteenth street boulevard.  The resolution recites the fact that under the charter the board had the right to make rules for the regulation of the parks, parkways and boulevards and provides that inasmuch as Nineteenth street from Chicago to Ohio streets, Ohio street from Nineteenth to Twentieth, Twentieth street from Ohio to the Florence boulevard and Florence boulevard to Miller park were a part of the park system of the city, no street railway tracks should be laid or poles set on those streets.  In acting on the resolution it was explained that this was not a declaration of war.  It was passed so that it could not be asserted that the board had not assumed the authority which had been conferred on it by the charter and it was proposed to have a conference with the street railway officials with the object of reaching an amicable adjustment of the difficulty.</p>
                            <p>In this connection a letter was received from John T. Cathers, asking the board to take steps to protect the boulevard.  Mr. Cathers, asking the board to take steps to protect the boulevard.  Mr. Cathers stated incidentally that he owned the west half of Twentieth street from Locust street to the base bell grounds, as it had never been formally dedicated to the city and that if the street railway company proceeded to construct tracks he would fence it up.  The letter was placed on file.</p>
                            <p>J. H. Van Dusen and C. M. Hunt of the South Omaha park commission appeared before the board to arrange for 500 trees to be used in beautifying the park at Twenty-sixth and E streets.  They will probably be accommodated as soon as Superintendent Adams has taken an inventory of the trees on hand so that the varieties that can be spared are ascertained.</p>
                            <p>The board will meet tomorrow to act on the bids for the construction of the bridges, but there is some doubt whether the contract will be awarded at this time.  It is admitted that if the bridges are to be built admitted that if the bridges are to be built it is time that the contract was let, but the boulevard is a complication that the members have not succeeded in disposing of.  They are unanimous in the opinion that if the boulevard is to be occupied by the street railway company they do not want to expend $10,000 on the bridges.  If they award the contract for the bridges it means that they will have to take chances on being able to keep the street railway tracks off the street.  Whether it is advisable to undertake the construction of the bridges and thus assume the controversy with the street car company is the point that will figure most prominently in the proceedings tomorrow.</p>

The regulations follow very closely those made for the Chicago fair, and provide that entries shall be made at customs houses according to prescribed forms laid down by the Treasury department and shall be accompanied by a description of each animal by such distinguishing marks and characteristics as shall serve to identify same when withdrawn from the exposition.  An advance copy of the regulations sent Mercer shows that the government explicitly states that it will not be responsible for the security or safe keeping of the animals, and transfer to transportation lines will be made under the supervision of the collector at the port of arrival.  The regulations go into effect immediately, and where they are not specifically set forth, it is understood that the rules laid down by the Department of Agriculture for quarantine and other health features will obtain.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Secretary Wakefield Points Out the Error to Which a Des Moines Paper Gives Circulation&#8212;Contractors' Statements.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>A piece of legislative gossip in the Des Moines Capital contains a somewhat extended interview with an alleged Iowa legislator who had recently paid a visit to Omaha.  During his stay in this city he had acquired two ideas in regard to the exposition, one of which was not entirely satisfactory to himself.  In the beginning the member spoke in the highest terms of the prospective beauties of the exposition.  He said that after his visit to the grounds he believed that the story of the Arabian Nights was a prophecy and that every blow of the hammer and touch of the saw gave the magical impress of Aladdin's lamp.  He was convinced that the exposition would be a colossal affair which would surprise everyone in its proportions.</p>
                            <p>The one complaint that the legislator had to make was that he had asked to have a mechanic from his county given employment and had been turned down.  He said that the "superintendent" to whom he applied had told him "There is no work here for Iowans."  He added that he had called on Vice President Wright of Iowa, who has assured him that there was no work on the grounds for anyone outside of the Trades Assembly of Omaha.  The legislator then intimated that this matter might have a serious bearing when the proposition to make an appropriation for the Iowa exhibit came before the legislature.</p>
                            <p>The facts in the case indicate a serious misunderstanding at least on the part of the member of the legislature who furnished the interview.  The fact is that a large number of Iowa men are now working on the exposition buildings, and that neither the exposition management nor the contractors have made the slightest effort to discriminate against Iowa applicants for employment.  Secretary Wakefield of the Exposition association says that there is not a particle of foundation for the impression which the interview seeks to establish.  He says that the employment of labor is not in the hands of the Exposition association at all.  The contractors employ their own men, the only restriction contained in their contracts being a provision that the union scale of wages shall be paid.  He calls attention to the fact that the very first man who was employed by the Department of Buildings and Grounds was M. S. Ralls of Council Bluffs, and he is still on the pay roll.</p>
                            </div3>

                            <head type="sub">WORK FOR IOWA MEN.</head>
                            <p>Continuing, Mr. Wakefield said: "This clipping was brought to my attention in a letter from Iowa this morning.  Since then I have taken pains to investigate the matter and in conversation with the contractors in charge of the various buildings I learn that men are employed and retained solely on their merits.  I further found that there are over fifty men from Iowa now on the pay rolls of the various contractors.  This should be a satisfactory showing when it is remembered that all the money that has been expended so far has been raised in Omaha except $1,800, which has been paid in by Council Bluffs subscribers.  The exposition has paid for labor to Iowa men more than five times as much as has been received in subscriptions from that state.  So it is apparent that there is no real justification for the complaint."</p>
                            <p>These facts were embodied in a reply to the Iowa man who sent the clipping and in conclusion Mr. Wakefield said: "It is a very small business for any man to be employed in to endeavor to work against an enterprise like the exposition.  No state in the transmississippi country will receive larger direct benefits from the exposition than Iowa.  It is easy to listen to idle rumors.  I assume it to be a fact that no one connected with the exposition and no contractor who works for the exposition has ever made the statement that there was no place there for Iowans.  We have arranged to have a great exposition here and it would be to Iowa's everlasting discredit and financial loss if they elected to stay away.  It is a plain business proposal which is apparent to any good businessman, and if, after mature reflection, Iowa concludes to stay out, it will be a more serious loss to Iowa than to the exposition.  We want Iowa's participation and will do everything that is reasonable, honorable and just to secure it.  Iowa appropriated $100,000 for representation at Chicago and the same amount of money expended at this exposition would result in ten times more good to the state than the Chicago investment."</p>
                            </div3>

                            <p>President Wattles confirmed the statement of Secretary Wakefield.  He suggested that the visitor had obviously made a mistake, inasmuch as there was no such official as a superintendent.  The exposition management had been repeatedly requested by the local labor unions to make a rule that only members of the local unions should be employed on e<unclear/>tory had refused to make such a rule and had only stipulated that on all future contracts union wages should be paid.  He knew of his personal knowledge that a considerable number of Iowa mechanics were now at work on the various buildings.</p>
                            <p>Inquiry among contractors who are engaged in the construction of the exposition buildings confirms the statement that quite a number of Iowa men are employed.  The contractors say that they don't care where the men come from as long as they are competent.  They state that it is probably a fact that outside men are asked to join the local unions, as is the case on any sort of work in cities where trades unions exist.  This is purely a matter between the men and the unions.  If a man comes here from another state and is not a member of the union at the place where he resides, he is expected by the local unions to unite with them.  If he agrees to do so within a couple of weeks or a reasonable period the local unions make no objection to his employment.  If he would refuse to do so they would probably protest, but as the outside men have usually connected themselves with the local unions no trouble has been experienced on that score.</p>

                            <p>Secretary M. V. Carroll of the Missouri Exposition commission writes to the Department of Exhibits that the Missouri commission would like to construct its state building of Missouri hard pine, both interior and exterior, and asks if there would be any objection to that or if the rules of the exposition required all buildings to be of staff on the outside.  He says the state produces a most excellent quality of hard pine, and the commission would like to exhibit its desirability for both inside and outside work if allowed to do so.  Mr. Carroll also says that Missouri architects are making frequent inquiry regarding the building and plans will be made as soon as the question of material is settled.</p>
                            <p>The department will inform Secretary Carroll that the Missouri commission will be allowed to construct its building of wood and given full latitude in its decoration, subject only to the approval of the architects-in-chief in order to assure architectural harmony and contrast with neighboring buildings.  The state buildings will be erected on the bluff tract and the architects desire as much variety as is compatible with good taste in this part of the grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">GOVERNOR LEEDY'S SCHEME IS WORKING</head>
                            <head type="sub">Failure of the Legislature to Make Proper Provision is Offset by Private Subscriptions to the Exposition Fund.</head>
                            <p>The legislature of the state of Kansas failed to make an appropriation for a state exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition, but nevertheless that member of the western sisterhood will be represented in a manner commensurate with its importance.  Mainly through the efforts of the governor, John W. Leedy, a fund is now being raised for an exhibit.  A nucleus of some $20,000, donated by the railroads of the state, has already been formed.</p>
                            <p>This important information is given by Oliver P. Updegraff of Topeka, who is in the city as a representative of the Colorado Springs Speed association at a meeting with the local fair and speed association to rearrange the western circuit.  Mr. Updegraff is also secretary of the Improved Stock Breeders' association of Kansas, which body held a meeting at the same time with the Kansas State Swine Breeders' association and the Kansas State Board of Agriculture, where the plan for forming a fund for an exhibit was incubated.</p>
                            <p>The plan of such a fund, however, is largely the idea of Governor Leedy, who is a progressive Kansan and who appreciates the good that will come to his state from having an exhibit at the exposition.  He is himself a practical farmer and stock breeder.  When the Kansas legislature failed to appropriate any sum for an exhibit he at once conceived the idea of securing the necessary funds from citizens and spring the idea upon the joint meeting referred to.</p>
                            <p>Governor Leedy presented his plan first to the railroads in the state.  There are four of these and they readily responded to his scheme.  Each of them subscribed $5,000 to the fund, which makes a total of $20,000 as a nucleus.  Governor Leedy is now intending to present his proposition to the leading business men of Kansas and he is confident that a very satisfactory sum will be secured for an exhibit.  In the very near future he intends to appoint a Kansas state commission, similar to those formed in other states, which will have charge of the disbursement of this money.</p>
                            <p>"Kansas is thoroughly in sympathy with the exposition," said Mr. Updegraff in speaking about the matter.  "It is one of the closest neighbors of Nebraska and therefore <unclear/> to do all in its <unclear/>

                            position to be held in Omaha.  At the same time it also considers that it can secure no greater benefit than from such an advertisement as it would secure by being fittingly represented at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>"Our legislature was pledged to economy.  It even failed to adequately provide for the different state institutions.  Consequently is did not pass any appropriation for an exhibit at the exposition.  But Governor Leedy is a broad-minded man and thoroughly appreciates the good results that would come from an appropriate exhibit.  He therefore took up the matter and you can rest assured that through his efforts Kansas will have proper representation.  Kansas is distinctively a farming and a breeding state and Governor Leedy is a farmer and a breeder.  He therefore understands the necessity of having a proper showing and he will have the support of every farmer and breeder in the state."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Extensive Dealers Order Large Numbers for Immediate Use.</head>
                            <p>Inquiries for exposition stamps are multiplying rapidly.  The local postoffice, the secretary of the exposition, the Department of Exhibits and the Department of Publicity and Promotion are constantly in receipt of letters asking when the stamps will be on sale and other pertinent inquiries.  Orders for large quantities of these stamps are coming in from all quarters and steps are being taken to urge the government to issue the stamps as soon as possible.</p>
                            <p>The Hafner Furniture company of Chicago has asked Secretary Wakefield to send $300 worth of the stamps for mailing its catalogues and an order was received several days ago from Montgomery, Ward &amp; Co. of Chicago for 8,000 of the 1 cent stamps.  The Boston Store placed an order several days ago with the Department of Publicity and Promotion for 100,000 1 cent stamps and other orders for smaller numbers are being received almost daily.</p>
                            <p>Some of the local merchants who do a large mail business have lately been considering a plan whereby the exposition stamps may be circulated all over the country and the exposition advertised extensively.  In addition to using these stamps for sending out their mail, it is proposed to use them for settling accounts with houses in other cities which use large numbers of stamps and would not be likely to refuse to receive the stamps as cash.  It is estimated that by this means the business men of Omaha could assist very materially in advertising the exposition without any additional cost to themselves.</p>
                            <p>Another plan that has been proposed and will probably be carried out is to ask the postmasters in every town in Nebraska and Iowa, and probably all in the transmississippi region, to make requisition for exposition stamps and push their sale.</p>
                            <p>By the operation of these plans and others that are under consideration it is estimated that millions of these stamps may be sold and sent all over the country, every one being an advertisement of the Transmississippi and International Exposition.</p>
                            <p>It is expected that some of these stamps will be issued early in February, probably between the first and the tenth of the month.  Postmaster Martin says he has written to the Postoffice department, urging that the stamps be issued as soon as possible, as there is a large local demand for them and making a requisition for a large number.  He has received no reply, but is of the opinion that the issue would be made as soon as the dies can be prepared.</p>

                            <p>Resolved, That the Nebraska State Volunteer Firemen's association, in annual convention assembled, sends greetings to the management of the Transmississippi and International Exposition at Omaha and that this association pledges to the management of the exposition the hearty and substantial support of all its members.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That this association, representing nearly every town and city in Nebraska, recognizes in the coming exposition an enterprise that does and of right ought to enlist the hearty, active and substantial support and encouragement of every loyal citizen of this state, and to that end this association desires to add whatever aid that may be within its power or within the power of its members to advance, encourage and promote the interests of the exposition, in order that it may attain the great success designed for it by its promoters and rebound not only to the credit of the state of Nebraska but to the whole transmississippi country, in the material welfare of which we and each of us feel deeply interested as citizens.</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That the president and secretary together with the Board of Control of this association, negotiate with the management of the exposition to the end that one of the special days during the exposition may be designated and set apart as "firemen's day," on which day the firemen of the whole transmississippi country would be invited to participate in the exercises of the day, and thus enlist the active interest of thousands of loyal workers for the success of this very worthy enterprise.</p>

                            <p>The Utah Exposition commission is making very satisfactory progress in its work of collecting a state exhibit of the resources of its various sections.  At a meeting held in Salt Lake this week the heads of departments reported favorable results in each line.  Special efforts are being made to have a fine showing of sugar beets and the products, and in the silk industry.  Don Maguire, the mining superintendent, reported that he had secured a large number of the finest specimens ever shown.  There was some discussion regarding the erection of a Utah building on the exposition grounds but no action was taken.  George D. Pyper was appointed as manager of the exhibit, to take care of it, put it in place and care for it during the exposition.</p>

The election resulted as follows: President, W. H. Bell of the Painters' union; vice president, O. P. Shrum of the Bricklayers' union; recording secretary, J. O. Bayard of the Theatrical Workers' union; financial secretary, V. B. Kinney of the Typographical union; treasurer, W. M. Taylor of the Machinists' union; sergeant-at-arms, A. H. Burpee of the Brewers' union; trustees, J. H. Johnson, C. E. Sparks and W. M. Eblinger.  President Bell and Financial Secretary Kinney were reelected.</p>
                            <p>The matter of holding a labor congress here is in the hands of Fred M. Youngs, who reported action.  Further consideration of the plan will be given at a future meeting.  The purpose is to hold a representative and national labor congress, in which delegates from all parts of the country and in all lines of trade will be seated.  Prominent labor leaders will be invited to attend the gathering.  The congress will probably be held in the week in September commencing with Labor day.</p>

The legislature will take no formal action toward accepting the invitation, which, indeed, has not been extended in a formal way to the legislature as a body.  It it simply agreed to adjourn Friday evening till Monday.  The special train with the legislature will leave on the Rock Island at 8 a. m. Saturday and arrive in Omaha about 11.  The party will go at once to the exposition grounds, after viewing which they will dine at the Millard.  In the afternoon the exposition management will receive those who wish to call for information.  The train will leave in the evening for the return trip, getting into Des Moines about midnight.

                            <head type="sub">Collective Arrangement in Proper Building Will Be Permitted if Assistant Secretary Dearing's Efforts Are Successful.</head>
                            <p>It is likely that when the Nebraska Exposition commission holds its regular meeting next week, commencing Tuesday evening, there will be a radical departure in the plans of the commission regarding allowing Nebraska counties to make separate exhibits in the main buildings and put up placards announcing the name of the county in which the products displayed were grown.  Assistant Secretary W. H. Dearing has been working for some time on a plan which will allow counties to exhibit their products in groups, and label each group with the name of the county from which it comes.  This does not mean that any county will be allowed to make a collective  exhibit, so-called, that is, to make an exhibit of horticulture, agriculture and other products in one group, but that any county which cares to do so may make an exhibit of agricultural products in the space provided by the state in the Agricultural building, and its horticultural products in the Horticultural building, and so on, each county furnishing the material comprising the exhibit and paying the expense of installing it.</p>
                            <p>This is a matter which has formed the subject of a large number of letters which have reached the office of the Nebraska commission and the matter has been discussed at length by the commission.  Many of the counties in the state are anxious to be allowed to make such exhibits, especially the eastern counties.  They write that they are willing to pay the expense attendant upon such an exhibit, providing the state will furnish the space and allow the name of the county to be displayed.  The state commission has already purchased a large amount of space in the various buildings, the amount reserved in the Agricultural building being especially large.  The plan of the commission thus far has been to make a state exhibit showing the agricultural resources of the state without <choice><sic>rererence</sic><corr>reference</corr></choice> to any particular county.  This idea has proved very unpopular with the counties and the state commission has been obliged to purchase all the material desired for making such an exhibit.  The producers say that if they or the county in which they live are not to receive the credit for the products grown there by having the name of the county displayed they will not contribute the material, but will sell the commission all it wants.  The fact has been growing on the commission that this would prove a
                            
                            <pb n="205" xml:id="TMISB03-205"/>
                            
                            very expensive method of making an exhibit and a large amount of money has already been expended in this manner with the result that the commission has a great deal of material on hand.  This could be utilized, however, in case the suggestions of Dr. Dearing are approved by the commission and will not be lost.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dearing has had some correspondence with Prof. F. W. Taylor, superintendent of the agricultural bureau of the Department of Exhibits, with a view of learning if any objections would be raised to county displays in the Agriculture building, the idea being to have the corn, wheat, potatoes, pumpkins, watermelons and other products of each county arranged in such form as the county managers may select, but to have a continuous agricultural exhibit in the space assigned to Nebraska.  Prof. Taylor says he can see no objections to such an arrangement.</p>
                            <p>Fortified with these documents, Assistant Secretary Dearing will being the matter before the commission at its next meeting and it is probable that this course will be adopted.  There has been a great deal of protest from the counties in the state regarding the plan proposed by the commission and the members of the commission will undoubtedly be glad of the opportunity to make the change.  It will relive the commission of an enormous expense and will be most gratifying to the <choice><sic>prducers</sic><corr>producers</corr></choice> in the state.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dearing says there are fully fifteen counties in the state the agricultural societies of which have already signified their willingness to appropriate any amount required to make such a display of their resources and he says he has no doubt whatever but that nearly every county in the state will be glad of the opportunity to do the same thing.  With free space and free transportation both ways on the railroads, the counties will be in a favourable position to make the best of the opportunity.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Transmississippi Exposition Ahead of Those of Europe.</head>
                            <p>Cass Gilbert, architect of the Agriculture building of the Transmississippi Exposition, is now traveling in Europe.  He has recently visited Brussels, Leipsic and other important points.  In writing to Walker &amp; Kimball of this city he says:</p>
                            <p>During the last six weeks I have had a chance to visit the grounds of several of the European expositions which have recently closed, particularly at Brussels and Leipsic, and to look over the designs for the grounds and buildings of the recent expositions at Antwerp and Nuremburg.</p>
                            <p>The Brussels exposition appeared the most important in its grounds and buildings and the main vista, terminating in a great central building with curved flanking colonnades, was very effective, but the placing of lesser buildings of varying styles and for minor uses upon either side of the central court or plaza was a mistake from my standpoint and detracted from the general effect.  In other words, leaving aside the great building mentioned, the scheme was without continuity and lacked both scale and symmetry.  The same criticism would apply also to the Leipsic exposition.  Neither in Brussels nor in Leipsic is there any extensive use of lagoons or canals, though in the latter there is a small lake or pond opposite the main entrance and cutting across the vista at its farther extremity there is a canal that might well have been brought into the scheme with good effect.</p>
                            <p>After my inspection of these expositions I want to tell you that I think your scheme of the exposition grounds at Omaha is better from every point of view and I am satisfied that not only the general effect, but the practical working of the exposition will be much more satisfactory than any of them.</p>
                            <p>I notice in all of the European expositions extensive accommodations at each side of the main entrances to the grounds for public comfort and particularly for "garde robes" or coat rooms, where overshoes, cloaks, parcels, etc., may be left, a small fee being charged, a fee also being charged at these places for use of the toilet apparatus, though free apparatus of a less satisfactory kind is extensively provided in the grounds at other points.  I also notice the free use of sculpture in the grounds in conjunction with the landscape gardening and I take the liberty of urging it upon your consideration.  If it is impossible to get funds for original works of this kind, the example of the Leipsic exposition might be followed, where well known antique groups or figures were used.  I find nothing gives such effect of scale to the buildings, nothing is more effective in minor vistas, at the entrance to bridges, on the ramps of the terrace steps, on axial lines of the entrances, or embedded in the shrubbery, as sculpture and if you could get copies of one or two of Barye's lions, a few figures of Ceres, Diana and that sort of thing, it would give an appearance of elegance and finish to the grounds as nothing else would do.</p>
                            <p>At the Leipsic exposition there was a Bavarian beer cellar in the style of a convent of the 12th century.  In the second story a large vaulted amusement hall and dining room below a large crypt vaulted and dimly lighted was used as the beer cellar and was very popular.  It was an interesting building, looked well and was profitable.</p>
                            <p>I trust you will permit me to suggest these things to you, as I am much interested in your work at the Omaha exposition, although you no doubt have already considered them.</p>

                            <p>State Superintendent W. R. Jackson, in charge of the state educational exhibit, is sending out a second circular to the educators in the state.  He announces the fact that the railroads have offered to transport all educational exhibits to and from the exposition free of charge, and says that with free space and free transportation the educational exhibit of Nebraska schools should be exceptionally fine.  He advises the counties to make exhibits of work in which they excel and urges the smaller schools to not attempt to make an exhibit of work in all the grades.  All public schools making application for space before February 1 will be granted space free of charge, and the exhibits will be taken in charge by a force under the direction of the state superintendent and put in position in the exposition building.  Prof. Jackson suggests that it will be well for counties to send one or more persons to Omaha to put the exhibit in place, in order to assure individuality of the county exhibit, but he says that this is not absolutely necessary, as he will have men for that purpose in case counties do not adopt this suggestion.</p>
                            <p>Prof. Jackson is also sending out letters of inquiry to the private schools of the state, asking for certain information requested by the Nebraska Exposition commission at its last meeting, relating to exhibits by these schools.  Lieutenant Governor Harris appeared before the commission to ask that the state furnish space for exhibits by private schools and in accordance with the instructions of the commission, Prof. Jackson is gathering information to learn how many of these schools will agree to make creditable exhibits providing the state furnishes the necessary space.</p>

Mr. Rosewater made a short talk on exposition matters and says he found the members of the commission quite enthusiastic over the progress which has been made in the enterprise and in their state.  The commission has received bids for the construction of the Wisconsin building and is about to let the contract for it.  Excellent headway has been made in the work of raising funds for the building and state exhibit.

                            <p>SIOUX CITY, Jan. 22.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;E. P. Stone, the absconding cashier of the Sioux City Savings bank, has been indicted by the grand jury of Woodbury county on the charge of embezzling $3,000 of the funds of the Mutual Trust and Deposit company.  This company was indirectly connected with the Savings bank and Stone took the whole of the cash capital and the stockholders cannot find any assets to redeem what they put into the company.  W. H. Knickerbacker of Balston Spa, N. Y., who lost $5,000, came to Sioux City to secure this indictment, and he says he will spend $1,000 to catch Stone and bring him back to justice.  Stone skipped out in the fall of 1896 with about $25,000 of the funds of the savings bank and now it develops that he took all the trust company's money also.  The last heard of Stone he was in Canada and an effort is being made to secure his arrest.</p>

                            <p>The Louisiana State Bureau of Agriculture is taking energetic steps to have that state well represented at the exposition.  Louisiana was the first state to take official action through its legislature recognizing the exposition and providing for a state exhibit.  The matter was brought to the attention of the legislature too late in the session for an appropriation to be made, but a resolution was unanimously adopted directing the State Bureau of Agriculture to make an exhibit and pledging the necessary funds.  The legislature has not had a meeting since that time, but the bureau is carrying out its instructions and is making a collection of the state's resources that will be brought to Omaha at the proper time.  Major J. G. Lee, commissioner of agriculture and immigration, and Dr. W. C. Stubbs, director of experiment stations, have been directed to come to Omaha in the near future and make the necessary arrangements for space, etc., for the exhibit.  Major Lee writes to the Department of Exhibits that he and Dr. Stubbs will start for Omaha February 2 or 3.  He says active preparations are now being made for the state exhibit which he says will be a most creditable one.</p>

                            <head type="sub">State Commission Asked to Provide for Its Proper Display.</head>
                            <p>It may surprise many to know that Nebraska produces, among many other things, a most excellent quality of pine lumber.  Sheridan and Dawes counties in the northwestern part of the state each has a considerable area of land covered with a thick growth of pine which cuts into lumber of merchantable size and sells on the spot for $10 per thousand.  Charles Mann, a member of the State Board of Agriculture and a resident of Dawes county, has been in the city during the last few days on business, and he brought the matter to the attention of the Nebraska Exposition commission with a view of having that body take hold of the matter and providing for an exhibit of the lumber interests of Nebraska.  Mr. Mann says the pine trees in his neighborhood average fully two feet in diameter and about forty feet in height, running up twenty feet or more perfectly straight without a limb.  He says it is a common thing to find trees four feet in diameter and sixty feet high, running forty feet to the lower limbs and about two feet in thickness at that distance from the ground.  This lumber is a yellow pine which makes good building material and is in great demand in that locality.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mann suggested to Assistant Secretary Dearing of the Nebraska commission that a pyramid by made of samples of this timber, starting with a cross-section of a four-foot tree and using smaller sections to any desired height.  He offered to supply the material if the commission would furnish the space.  Dr. Dearing will bring the matter to the attention of the commission at its next <unclear/> lumber display will probably <unclear/>'s exhibit.</p>

                            <head type="sub">St. Louis Structure Will Decorate the Two-Cent Denomination.</head>
                            <p>When the Transmississippi Exposition memorial 2-cent stamp is issued it will bear on its face a presentation of one of the greatest, if not the greatest, gates to the empire west of the mighty Father of Waters.  Late advices from Washington are to the effect that when the designs for postage stamps for the Omaha exposition were under consideration recently by the Postoffice department a suggestion was made to put a picture of the Rock Island bridge upon one stamp of the series.  This did not strike the postmaster general favorably, and he substituted the Eads bridge at St. Louis for the Rock Island structure.  One of the strongest arguments for the Rock Island bridge was that it was the finest structure of any magnitude over the Mississippi river, and therefore should be honored with a place on the new stamps.  In making the arrangements for the new series for Omaha the bridge stamp was to have been of the $2 denomination, but the postmaster general determined upon another change.  He thought the bridge should placed on the most popular denomination, and accordingly ordered it changed to the 2-cent stamps.  These designs are now at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and it is the desire of the postal authorities to have them ready for distribution June 1, when the exposition is to be inaugurated.</p>

                            <p>Minnesota was little late in waking up, but it is apparent that energetic effort is now being made to compensate for any disadvantage that might have come from lagging.  Since the importance of the exposition was fairly placed before the businessmen of the Twin Cities at the Minneapolis meeting some two weeks ago, there has been an exhibition of interest that is very assuring to those who have hoped to see the great state represented by a creditable showing of its great and varied resources.  It was a matter of some surprise that Minnesota, which with Missouri, California and Iowa, forms the great quartet of transmississippi leaders, should have held back, but the start has been made, and there is to be no more lagging behind.  Last week Governor Clough named a commission for the state which comprises some of the most energetic men in the several congressional districts to which they are accredited, and now the businessmen of the great manufacturing centers are being aroused.  On Friday Governor Clough published the following proclamation:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, It appears that the states and territories west of the Mississippi river have united in the preparation of a great exposition of the material wealth of this section, said exposition to be held in the city of Omaha, Neb., between June and November 1, of 1898, and that the several commonwealths in the transmississippi district are to be there represented; and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, It further appears that no provision has been made upon the part of the state of Minnesota for representation in said exposition by legislative enactment or otherwise; and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, It appears that it is desirable that Minnesota, with its mines, its agricultural wealth, its timber and its manufacturing and commercial industries, should join her sister states in this exposition of the great resources of the region west of the Mississippi river;</p>
                            <p>Now therefore, I, D. M. Clough, governor of the state of Minnesota, constitute and appoint H. W. Lamberton of Winona, C. D. Gilfillan of Morgan, Hudson Wilson of Fariboult, W. D. Kirke, Theodore L. Schurmeier and W. J. Footner of St. Paul; J. Newton Nind, F. G. Winston and E. L. Danforth of Minneapolis; F. B. Daugherty of Duluth and Elmer E. Adams of Fergus Falls as commissioners on the part of the state of Minnesota and take such other action as may be necessary for the proper representation of this commonwealth at the Transmississippi and International Exposition at Omaha, Neb., in 1893.</p>
                            <p>In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the great seal of the state to be hereto affixed, at the capitol, in the city of St. Paul, this 21st day of January, A. D. 1898.  D. M. CLOUGH, Governor.  Attest: ALBERT BERG, Secretary of State.</p>
                            <p>In commenting on the matter the St. Paul Globe says: "It is proposed to have the state make a creditable exhibit at the Omaha show, a project in which up to the present the Minneapolis people have taken the most interest.  Governor Clough has appointed three St. Paul hustlers in the persons of Theodore L. Schurmeier, W. J. Footner and W. D. Kirke, representing as they do the wholesale trade, especially, and the transportation interests which center here, with marked prominence.  With J. Newton Nind to stand for the lumbermen, F. G. Winston and F. B. Daugherty to represent those whose business it is to construct large public improvements and C. D. Gilfillan to speak for the agricultural interests it would appear that the governor himself was in sympathy with the spirit of making the Minnesota exhibit thoroughly representative of the state's varied resources with favoritism to none."</p>

                            <p>Bent, Fremont, Otero, Prowers and Pueblo counties, Colorado, have formed an association to be known as the Arkansas Valley Association of Colorado.  The main object of the association is the advancement of the material interests of the people who live in the valley of the Arkansas after it leaves the mountains.  One of the first steps taken by the new association was to adopt the following resolutions:</p>
                            <p>Be it Resolved, First, That the commissioners of the several counties comprising this association be requested in writing to confirm their respective delegates appointed for this meeting also as members of the executive board of this association, or substitute other delegates where necessary, and that these counties shall be the following: Fremont, Pueblo, Otreo, Bent and Prowers, and that each of these counties shall be represented by two delegates on the executive committee of this association.</p>
                            <p>Second, That this association ask the county commissioners of each of the aforesaid counties to appropriate the sum of $2,000 and that said money be used toward a suitable display of the products of the Arkansas valley of Colorado at the Transmississippi and International Exposition.</p>
                            <p>Third, That these exhibits shall comprise the various resources and industries, such as agriculture, horticulture, mines, manufactures, fine arts, educational and other interests.</p>
                            <p>Fourth, That this association shall work in conjunction with the Colorado exposition commission, appointed by the governor of the state.</p>
                            <p>Fifth, That there shall be appointed by the delegates of this association a general commissioner, who shall represent our interests at the Omaha exposition and to whom shall be sent all exhibits of this association and to whom will fall the duties of taking proper care thereof.</p>
                            <p>The officers of the association are not yet announced, but temporary organization was made by B. F. Rockafellow and H. M. Mingay of Fremont, C. B. Schmidt and William B. Elbert of Pueblo, L. W. Markham, A. E. Bent and W. J. Johnson of Prowers, and Fred B. Mason and William H. Taylor of Otero counties.  B. F. Rockafellow was elected temporary chairman and William B. Elbert secretary of the association.</p>
                            <p>A meeting will be called about the middle of February and a committee appointed to elect representatives to take charge of an exhibit of the products of the Arkansas valley of Colorado at the Omaha exposition.  The exhibit embracing floriculture, horticulture, agriculture, manufacture, fine arts and education, and all other industries of the five counties embraced in the association.</p>

                            <p>Chairman Walbridge of the St. Louis commission has called a meeting at which the local manufacturers are to report the amount of space which each will require for his exhibit, in order that it may be calculated in the total amount of space asked for by the St. Louis commission.  Both the St. Louis and the Missouri State commissions are actively at work preparing to make creditable displays, and state and city pride are being thoroughly aroused on the subject.</p>
                            <p>President Clark H. Sampson of the state commission has received a letter from J. R. Rippey, secretary of the Missouri State Board of Agriculture, regretting that the writer and Dr. Jesse were unable to accompany the commission on its recent visit to Omaha.  Secretary Rippey also reiterates his intention of placing a man in charge of the Missouri agricultural exhibit at Omaha, if at all possible, and stated that on January 20 he had sent a circular letter to the members of every county court, to county clerks, county crop reporters, the country press and to all the members of the legislature, urging upon the necessity of Missouri having creditable exhibits at Omaha, and asking for their hearty co-operation.</p>
                            <p>In line with the letter from the secretary of the State Board of Agriculture.  President Clark H. Sampson yesterday mailed letters to nearly every banking and financial institution in Missouri, asking for contributions to a fund for helping the state make a creditable showing at Omaha.  It is calculated that at least $25,000 will be necessary in order that the city may maintain its prestige among its vigorous rivals, and the finance committee of the St. Louis commission held an important meeting at 4 o'clock Thursday afternoon to consider this subject.  As a result the following chairmen of committees were selected:</p>

                            <p>The Wisconsin commission at its last meeting, held last Friday at Milwaukee, decided to push the work on the state building without further delay.  Nearly every bit of material needed for the construction of the building was donated by the manufacturers who were present at the meeting.  In addition to this the commission has a fund of $20,000 started, the money to be used in making a display of the state's products.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>When the Bureau of Public Comfort is organized for active work it will find it has its hands full in disseminating information to the citizens of Omaha, and thereby putting a stop to the swindling operations which are already being practiced on unsuspecting householders.  This bureau will be the official representative of the exposition in all matters relating to the accommodation of visitors to the city.  The exact extent to which the functions of this organization will be extended has not been determined, as no meeting of the bureau has been held.  Chairman Dudley Smith says he will call a meeting of the bureau as soon as Mr. Arthur C. Smith returns to the city, and the plan of operations will then be decided upon.</p>
                            <p>Up to this time the exposition has taken absolutely no steps in the direction of providing for the accommodation of visitors, except to appoint three members of a joint committee, composed of representatives of the Commercial club, Woman's club and Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben.  This committee did nothing, as far as the public is concerned, except to collect a limited amount of data regarding the extent of the hotel accommodations of the city.</p>
                            <p>Certain persons are going about the city visiting private houses and telling the housewife who answers the door that they represent a concern which has a contract with the exposition management to make a list of persons who want to rent rooms to strangers coming to the city during the exposition.  These solicitors endeavor to induce the housewife to become a patron of their concern and promise, in considerations of the payment of $5, to keep her rooms full. It is also stipulated that the subscriber must pay a small percentage of her receipts to the company represented by the solicitor.  These charges are explained by saying that the $5 is to cover the expense of organizing and advertising the company, and the other payments are to help meet the revenue which the company must pay to the exposition.  It is represented that the contract with the exposition management requires the company to pay to the exposition 10 per cent of its receipts, and the patriotism of the housewife is worked upon to join the company as a means of helping the exposition while deriving a benefit herself.  No arrangement of this kind has been made with any person or collections of persons, and nothing whatever in this line has been done by the exposition.</p>

                            <p>In reply to a question regarding this matter, Secretary Wakefield of the exposition said: "No such arrangement has ever been made by the executive committee of the exposition, and no proposition embodying any such conditions has ever been submitted to the committee by any person or company.  All matters of that kind belong to the Bureau of Public Comfort, which has not yet had any meeting, so that no arrangement could have been made with that committee."</p>
                            <p>It is learned that representatives of this concern have visited a large number of people in different sections of the city, and the amount of money that has been fraudulently obtained from the people of Omaha is unknown, but is thought to be considerable.</p>
                            <p>Another matter which will engage the <choice><sic>atention</sic><corr>attention</corr></choice> of the Bureau of Public Comfort will be that of hotel rates.  That some of the hotels contemplate a raise in their rates is indicated by certain action on their part.  It is learned on the authority of a man who holds a high position in a certain state government that he endeavored to make arrangements with a certain hotel in this city for accommodations for the governor of his state and a large suite during the opening days of the exposition.  The hotel man refused to reserve any rooms or to make any agreement regarding rates, saying he would be glad to accommodate the party if he had the rooms when the time came, but positively refused to say what the rate would be.</p>
                            <p>The members of the Bureau of Public Comfort have several plans under consideration which contemplate the erection by private patties of large temporary hotels for the accommodation of the large influx of visitors to the city during the summer, and also have several other plans which they will present for the consideration of the other members, to prevent the overcharging of visitors.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Governor Jones Names a State Exposition Commission.</head>
                            <p>The list of states which have appointed exposition commissions has been increased by the addition of Arkansas.  Governor Daniel W. Jones has appointed six representatives of the different sections of the state to serve with Vice President W. G. Vincenheller of Little Rock, as a state commission.  The governor addressed the following letter to each one of the appointees:</p>
                            <p>Dear Sir:  Notwithstanding the fact that the legislature declined to make any appropriation for an Arkansas exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha this year, yet in view of the importance of an exhibit as a means of attracting to our state the immigration from the northwest, which has been and is seeking milder climate, and for other purposes, it has been decided to endeavor to procure a creditable exhibit there by other means.  To this end a board of commissioners for Arkansas is necessary and I have been asked by the exposition managers to announce the board now.</p>
                            <p>Colonel W. G. Vincenheller is vice president for Arkansas of the exposition and will naturally be the chairman of the board, and each commissioner will be expected to render all aid possible in securing exhibits from his part of the state and, if all participate, to attend the exposition at such time as may be agreed upon.  I am assured that transportation for our exhibits will be given, but it will require some effort upon the part of the board to collect them, though a great deal can be taken from Colonel Vincenheller's collection, already on hand here.</p>
                            <p>I have therefore selected the following named gentlemen to serve with Colonel Vincenheller on the board, viz:</p>
                            <p>George R. Brown, Little Rock; A. Bertig, Paragould; C. G. Newman, Pine Bluff; L. A. Byrne, Texarkana; W. D. Matthews, Stuttgart; George Sengel, Fort Smith.</p>
                            <p>I earnestly hope that you will accept and will be able to give some time and attention to this, which is not merely a matter of form, but of real importance.  You are requested to advise whether or not you can accept and to correspond with Colonel Vincenheller regarding the work to be done.</p>
                            <signed>Very truly yours.  DANIEL W. JONES, <lb/> Governor.</signed>

                            <p>The architects-in-chief have completed the preliminary perspective view of the Transportation and Agricultural Implement building, which will be erected on the north tract on the east side of Twentieth street, facing west.  The building has a frontage of thirty feet deep and a depth of 432 feet.  The style of architecture is what is known as "mediaeval half timber," sometimes called "Swiss farm architecture."  The ornamentation is secured by the timbering, which is partly exposed to view, the intermediate space being covered with plaster in the natural color, the timbers being painted a warm sienna.  Wide overhangings, broad cornices, ornamental rafters and brackets will be features of this style.  The building will be one story in height at all points except a wide section at either end, where a clear story will give a two-story effect to the exterior.  The eaves will be sixteen feet from the ground at all points except the clear story, where they will be twenty-four feet from the ground.  The whole building will be floored with hard pine.  Deep entrance porches at central points in the east and west facades will give the building a handsome appearance.</p>
                            <p>The Dairy and Apiary buildings will be in the same style of architecture and will be located opposite this building on the west side of Twentieth street.  The architects assigned to these buildings have been working on them for several weeks and the plans will soon be completed.</p>

                            <p>A. D. Rodgers of New York is in the city conferring with the Department of Concessions for the privilege of bringing to the exposition his educated horse.  According to Mr. Rogers and newspaper clippings from the largest papers in the east, his horse, Jim Key, is little short of a marvel.  Numerous clippings from some of the most reliable newspapers in the country describe in minute detail the manners in which this horse accomplishes feats which are incredible.  He writes his name on a blackboard with a piece of chalk held in his mouth; operates a cash register by taking a piece of money and making correct change when told the amount of the purchase by the person making the purchase and not by his trainer, takes a letter from a box when told the number of the box which it is and the name of the addressee and puts the letter in a file case under the proper letter without being told the spelling of the name.  There are a number of other feats which this horse accomplishes according to what seems to be indisputable testimony contained in letters from prominent people and the newspaper clippings referred to.  The animal is said by Mr. Rogers to be 8 years of age, a bay about sixteen hands high, sired by Volunteer out of Flora, a full-blood Arabian.  He was raised by a colored man well known in the south, who spent seven years in educating the animal.</p>

                            <p>One of the most courteous and polite representatives of the south who ever came to Washington, relates the Chicago Tribune, is ex-Senator Ransom of South Carolina, who has recently returned to this country from Mexico, where he was the American minister.  If there is anything "Matt Ransom," as he is called, prides himself upon it is his courtly manner and distinguished bearing under any and all circumstances.  But his dignity was given a jolt at the Metropolitan hotel a day or two ago in a manner that the punctilious North Carolinian will never forget.</p>
                            <p>Only a few minutes before the incident occurred he had been lecturing a constituent on the evils of drinking and pointing to himself as an example of sobriety and total abstinence.  Hanging upon his arm at this time was a lightweight overcoat, and his hand was tightly gripped around the handle of a small leather satchel.  One of the bellboys grabbed the overcoat and satchel simultaneously for the purpose of taking them up to Mr. Ransom's room.  In his haste the bellboy tripped and sprawled on the floor and a suspicious-looking black bottle slipped out of one of the overcoat pockets and was smashed into a thousand pieces on the marble floor of the hotel corridor.</p>
                            <p>"There goes my bottle of catsup," said Mr. Ransom, without changing a muscle of his face.  But the odor that arose from the marble floor was suggestive of the strongest liquor ever brewed by a North Carolina moonshiner.</p>

                            <head type="sub">State Commission Asked to Provide for Its Proper Display.</head>
                            <p>It may surprise many to know that Nebraska produces, among many other things, a most excellent quality of pine lumber.  Sheridan and Dawes counties in the northwestern part of the state each has a considerable area of land covered with a thick growth of pine which cuts into lumber of merchantable size and sells on the spot for $10 per thousand.  Charles Mann, a member of the State Board of Agriculture and a resident of Dawes county, has been in the city during the last few days on business, and he brought the matter to the attention of the Nebraska Exposition commission with a view of having that body take hold of the matter and providing for an exhibit of the lumber interests of Nebraska.  Mr. Mann says the pine trees in his neighborhood average fully two feet in diameter and about forty feet in height, running up twenty feet or more perfectly straight without a limb.  He says it is a common thing to find trees four feet in diameter and sixty feet high, running forty feet to the lower limbs and about two feet in thickness at that distance from the ground.  This lumber is a yellow pine which makes good building material and is in great demand in that locality.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mann suggested to Assistant Secretary Dearing of the Nebraska commission that a pyramid be made of samples of this timber, starting with a cross-section of a four-foot tree and using smaller sections to any desired height.  He offered to supply the material if the commission would furnish the space.  Dr. Dearing will bring the matter to the attention of the commission at its next meeting and a lumber display will probably form one feature of Nebraska's exhibit.</p>

                            <p>When the Transmississippi Exposition memorial 2-cent stamp is issued it will bear on its face a presentation of one of the greatest, if not the greatest, gates to the empire west of the mighty Father of Waters.  Late advices from Washington are to the effect that when the designs for postage stamps for the Omaha exposition were under consideration recently by the Postoffice department a suggestion was made to put a picture of the Rock Island bridge upon one stamp of the series.  This did not strike the postmaster general favorably, and he substituted the Eads bridge at St. Louis for the Rock Island structure.  One of the strongest arguments for the Rock Island bridge was that it was the finest structure of any magnitude over the Mississippi river, and therefore should be honored with a place on the new stamps.  In making the arrangements for the new series for Omaha the bridge stamp was to have been of the $2 denomination, but the postmaster general determined upon another change.  He thought the bridge should be placed on the most popular denomination, and accordingly ordered it changed to the 2-cent stamps.  These designs are now at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and it is the desire of the postal authorities to have then ready for distribution June 1, when the exposition is to be inaugurated.</p>

                            <head type="sub">PRESIDENT TUKEY STATES THE CASE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Is Willing to Abandon the Florence Boulevard if the People Want the Street Car Tracks Instead.</head>
                            <p>The members of the Board of Park Commissioners have definitely decided to oppose the proposition to abandon the Twentieth street boulevard in favor of street railway tracks.  This was indicated when the board awarded the contract for the bridges over the lagoon, and it is now positively affirmed.  The members say that they are willing to abandon the boulevard if it is demanded by public sentiment, but if this is required the abandonment will be complete.  They assert that having expended years of labor and thousands of dollars in improving Twentieth street, they will not drop the improved street to take up one on which the same must be done again.</p>
                            <p>Speaking for at least a majority of the board this morning, President Tukey said: "The Park commissioners want to do what the public approves of.  If the property owners in the northern part of the city prefer a street car upon Twentieth street boulevard to the boulevard, we are perfectly willing to abandon that boulevard from Chicago street to Kountze park and let it commence at Kountze park.  We will not be a party to real estate speculations on Nineteenth or Twenty-second street, nor will we, after expending over $10,000 in grading, cindering and planting trees along a boulevard, consent to surrender it and accept another parallel street whereon to make the same expenditures, and then probably have it taken from us and another street given to make the same expenditure upon.  If the board is correct on the value of boulevards, the property along the same will become more valuable and more densely populated than other parts of the city.  Manifestly, therefore, there would be a profit to the street car company to follow in the wake of the park board and appropriate each boulevard as soon as it is improved.  To this the park board cannot consent.</p>
                            <p>"We are glad that Mr. Morse frankly states that the purpose of the street car company is to permanently occupy Twentieth street.  We knew this, because for the purposes of the exposition the extension is entirely unnecessary.  The capacity of the street car company will be tested when people are coming home from the exposition, not when they are going, for the reason that they will go at all hours of the day, but al will return about the same time.  The Twentieth street entrance will be farther removed from all buildings north of the lagoon than either the Twenty-fourth or the Sixteenth street entrance.  As to the buildings south of the lagoon, the same will be true except the building between Twentieth and Twenty-second streets, and the building between Twentieth and Eighteenth streets.  Therefore, there are but two buildings to be accommodated by the proposed extension.  It is to be presumed that there will be very many people who desire to go to the exposition on bicycles, carriages or on foot.  There will be many parades demanding entire streets.  It would be shameful not to have a <choice><sic>singe</sic><corr>single</corr></choice> street suitable for such purposes.  The location of Florence boulevard, of Kountze park, the magnificent bridges which have just been contracted for in Kountze park, the improvements already made, have designated North Twentieth street as a boulevard.  The same cannot be changed and will not be abandoned except to respond to a public desire, which thus far has not manifested itself to our knowledge."</p>

                            <p>OMAHA, Jan. 22.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee:  The Park commission is taking undue precaution (so far as the Omaha Street railway is concerned) in asserting its control over a part of Twentieth street and other streets proposed to be used as boulevards.  The street railway will have no contest with the park board for rights of possession.  Neither will it have any conflict with the city of Omaha.  If the street car tracks are not needed and wanted on North Twentieth street from Lake street (the present terminus) to the main entrance of the Transmississippi Exposition grounds, then they will not be put there.</p>
                            <p>It is for the citizens to decide.  As a matter of fact, however, the street cars are the poor man's yellow carriages and should go wherever the greatest number can be served.</p>
                            <p>At the present time the Omaha street railway has double tracks on Sixteenth street and on Twenty-fourth street, and in all reason there should be a line equidistant between the two, that is, to say on Twentieth street.  It has been suggested that the Twentieth street line could be extended by going one block east to Nineteenth street, or one block west to Twenty-first street.  The objections to such a course are several, among others, both the streets named are not entirely open, are not in condition to build upon, would involve unnecessary curves and lengthen the route, and would also bring the line too near one of the other lines already mentioned.  The suggestion has been made to put in temporary tracks on Twentieth street, removing them after the close of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Speaking for myself only on this proposition I would never consent to it.  The interests of the residents north of Lake street (and the street railway interests are naturally identical with them) demand that a street railway should be operated on Twentieth street permanently.  The Omaha Street Railway company is spending quite enough money, both in direct donations to the Transmississippi Exposition and in improvements necessitated by its coming, without building a temporary road for a business that will be crowded into ninety days' travel, say in September, October and November, 1898.</p>
                            <p>To show that the company is well equipped at the present time for its ordinary business I will state that it has a power house at Twenty-second and Izard streets in which it has two fine engines.  Still, with the exception of State fair week, the company has not turned a wheel in this house for over a year.  Further, in the power house at the corner of Nineteenth and Twentieth and Nicholas streets there are two fine Westinghouse engines which are seldom used, the company having other engines capable of doing all its ordinary work.  But we judge the strength of a chain by its weakest link, so we judge the probable necessities of a street railway by its prospective largest day's travel, and having in view the future General Manager Smith of the Omaha Street railway visited the east some two months ago and ordered and now has under construction one engine which at its maximum capacity will develop 1,800 horse power.  The General Electric company is building a dynamo of equal power, all of which will necessitate the placing of new boilers, the building of new smokestacks and all the other necessary additions that would naturally follow in the wake of such improvements.</p>
                            <p>Exclusive of horse cars the company now has on hand over 240 available cars, and is constantly turning out from its Omaha shops rebuilt cars equal or superior to many produced in the east.  In addition to this Manager Smith when in New York placed an order for nearly $50,000 of new equipment cars, to be duplicates of the most modern patterns now in use on Broadway, New York.  It might be asked, where does the company intend using this new car equipment?  My own idea is (and I know that other directors of the company agree with me) that as soon as the frost is out of the ground we should commence the construction of a double track road (seventy-five pounds to the yard rail, similar to the new Farnam street line) beginning on Fifteenth street somewhere south of Creighton theater, and extending north on the same street to the vicinity of Cass street, and thence west on Cass to Twentieth, and thence north on Twentieth to the exposition main entrance, providing the North Twentieth street extension is made.  If the North Twentieth street extension is not made, then it is possible the line would not be built, but if built, it would reach over the Twenty-fourth street tracks, to the west entrance, or over the Sixteenth street tracks to the east entrance.  This line if completed and equipped as stated would reflect credit on the Street Railway company, on the city and would greatly add to the success of the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The positive and direct expenditures entailed on the company in carrying out the things under way and outlined (and excluding the cost of new tracks contemplated) cannot be less than $150,000 to $200,000, and it takes just 4,000,000 of 5-cent fares to make the latter sum.  Whatever tends to the advancement of Omaha, builds up the Omaha street railway, and if not now, yet the benefits will come some time.  In a city where nearly one-half the land is devoted to use for streets and alleys it ought not to be difficult to find other streets for a boulevard besides the one on which a street car line naturally belongs.</p>

                            <head type="sub">SEEK INFORMATION OF EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Nearly Every One of the Members Will Join an Excursion from Des Moines to Omaha on Saturday.</head>
                            <p>It is expected that a large number of the members of the Iowa legislature will visit Omaha Saturday of this week for the purpose of informing themselves regarding the status of exposition matters and viewing the progress that has been made in preparing for the great show.  Letters received by President Wattles from prominent members of both branches of the legislature state that nearly every member of these bodies will be in the party and that a number of women, wives of members, will accompany their husbands.  In addition to these several of the officers of both houses and a number of press representatives will come.</p>
                            <p>Chairman L. F. Potter of the ways and means committee of the house says that nearly all the members of the legislature will come and that the trip will be purely a matter of business.  He says the invitation was not laid before the house on account of fear of adverse criticism and no reference was made to it in the house proceedings, but the body will simply adjourn Friday until Monday to give those who desire to do so an opportunity to come.  Speaker Funk says a majority of the members of the house will accept the invitation and he himself will be of the party.</p>
                            <p>Senator Pusey of Council Bluffs says more than a majority of the senate will probably be in the party and that many of the members of both houses will bring their wives.  He says it is desired to avoid all appearance of a junket and that every member of the party goes for information and without feeling pledged to vote for an additional appropriation for an Iowa exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Lieutenant Governor Milliman will be in the party, and also several of the members of the Iowa Exposition commission.  Secretary Chase writes that ex-Governor Packard and himself will accompany the party, and that other members of the commission will do likewise.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles has appointed the full board of directors of the exposition as a committee to meet the Iowa delegation and assist in entertaining it.  The party will arrive about 11 a. m. Saturday by special train over the Rock Island road, and will be met at the depot by the board of directors.  At the depot the whole party will board a special train of street cars and proceed at once to the exposition grounds, where the visitors will be shown all over the buildings and grounds, and they will then be escorted to one of the hotels and entertained at luncheon.  The main body of the delegation will return to Des Moines the same evening, but some of the party will spend Sunday in Omaha.</p>

                            <head type="sub">NEW MEXICO'S GREAT EXHIBIT.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Commissioner Leeson Grows Enthusiastic Over the Outlook.</head>
                            <p>J. J. Leeson of New Mexico, a member of the exposition commission appointed by Governor Otero, arrived in Omaha this morning to make arrangements for space for New Mexico's exhibit.  By some misunderstanding ex-Governor Prince arrived before him and returned to his home.  Commissioner Llewellyn did not come as was intended.  Commissioner Leeson was manager of the exhibit made by the territory at the Tennessee exposition and expressed himself most enthusiastically regarding the outlook for a large and creditable exhibit from New Mexico.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the $1,500 appropriated by the legislature for an exhibit, Mr. Leeson says the counties will contribute between $5,000 and $6,000 to the fund for an exhibit, and the State Board of Immigration will contribute about $3,500.  New Mexico's display will include exhibits showing the agricultural, horticultural, educational and historical resources of the territory.  The commissioner says the people in his state are taking much more interest in the idea of making an exhibit at Omaha than they did at Nashville or Chicago, and will make a fine exhibit.  He was most enthusiastic regarding the resources of that section, and described in glowing language the favorable conditions which he says exist there.  Among other <choice><sic>thongs</sic><corr>things</corr></choice>, he says, "New Mexico today offers to the intelligent and enterprising capitalists and prospector a sure, speedy and reliable return for investment or labor.  The great mineral zone or belt is 100 miles wide and nearly 400 miles long, extending from the Colorado line to the Republic of Mexico.  This vast scope of country abounds in minerals, building stones, fire clay, marble, coal, precious stones and gems, and the richest soil and grazing lands.  No country offers so many natural advantages as this vast territory."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Leeson is somewhat of an enthusiast in the collection of specimens of minerals and has a private collection which weighs twenty-four tons.  He says he will send this as a part of the state exhibit.  He also says that the historical portion of the exhibit which will be made will be very interesting.  It will include fine specimens of the many valuable historical relics found in the territory, including pottery and implements used during the stone age, knives, arrows, etc., illustrating the copper age, relics of the Aztec population and of the cliff dwellers.</p>

                            <p>The farmers of southwestern Nebraska are preparing to take active steps for making a showing of their resources at the exposition which will surprise the natives.  These farmers have an organization known as the Southwestern Nebraska Farmers' convention, which will meet at McCook February 2 and 3.  Eight counties are represented in this association and the county commissioners of all of these counties will attend this meeting.  One of the principal matters which will be discussed will be the idea of having the Board of County Commissioners in each of these counties appropriate a sufficient amount to enable this section of the state to be represented at the exposition in a manner which shall show to the world the magnificent resources of the western part of the state.  The report comes from that section that the prospect of success in this movement is very flattering.</p>

                            <p>The Nebraska Exposition commission will hold its regular semi-monthly meeting at the Millard hotel, commencing tonight and continuing until tomorrow afternoon.</p>
                            <p>One of the most important matters which will be considered by the commission will be the plan of allowing each county in the state which desires to do so to make a separate exhibit of its agricultural products in the space in the Agricultural building assigned to Nebraska.  There is little doubt in the minds of those who have canvassed the sentiments of members of the commission that there will be no opposition to the plan and that it will be adopted.</p>
                            <p>The commission will open bids for furnishing the groups of statuary which are to be placed on the Nebraska building.  Four bids have been received, accompanied by models showing the groups.  Some of these are very attractive and well conceived.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Montana will have a prominent corner in the Mines building and Vice President Sutherlin, assisted by L. W. Curtis and J. W. Chapman, his assistants, are making every effort to have an exhibit which will draw attention to the mineral resources of the state.  The plan of displaying the ores will be by means of pyramids, a dozen or more of which have been constructed.  Some of the large companies will have one or more whole pyramids.  The Anaconda company has quarried in one of its mines a three-ton block of almost pure copper glance and this will be sent entire to Omaha.  Other exhibits of copper, gold and silver will also be sent by the company.  Nearly every large mining company in the state has promised a fine collection of ore specimens.  The Original will send a thousand-pound specimen of peacock copper, the Alice will furnish a thousand-pound piece of silver ore, the Coloma district will send fine specimens of gold ore and similar displays will be made by nearly every mining district in the state.  Mr. Sutherlin and his assistants are now working in Butte, endeavoring to arouse interest in that section, which has heretofore been a little backward about taking an interest in the exhibit project.</p>
                            <p>The newly created Texas Exposition commission is taking energetic steps to secure representation for the Lone Star state at the exposition and the indications are very favorable for an exhibit of the resources of that state which will be more extensive than any showing ever made by Texas at any exposition.  Vice President S. J. T. Johnson attended a meeting at Houston last week for the purpose of considering exposition matters.  B. A. Riesner, Houston's representative on the state commission, was present, as well as a number of the most enterprising of Houston's business men, constituting the local exposition committee.  Secretary Tom Richardson of the Business league suggested that Houston's exhibit should emphasize the city's facilities as a great railroads center, capable of handling all the products of the transmississippi country.  He urged the appointment of committees to look after the details of raising funds, preparing the exhibit, etc.</p>

                            <p>The suggestions regarding committees were adopted and the following appointed:  On statistics, advertising and detail&#8212;E. L. Dennis, George W. Kidd, C. W. Hahl, John Lyons.  Finance&#8212;Rufus Cage, B. A. Riesner, F. Hacker.  Display&#8212;W. A. Childress, F. A. Reichardt, E. Y. Hartwell.</p>
                            <p>It was the general opinion that at least $2,500 would be required for an exhibit and Vice President Johnson urged that the money raised by the various communities should be turned into one fund to be used in making a state exhibit, in which the communities contributing should be given the largest representation, but he insisted that unless this was done there would not be a state exhibit but a sectional exhibit.  Vice President Johnson announced that he would visit Omaha in the near future to arrange for space, etc., and said at least 5,000 feet would be required.  A letter from Vice President Johnson received by the Department of Publicity and Promotion announces that the thirty-one commissioners of Texas have all been chosen and will meet at Dallas February 1, to organize for business and devise ways and means for raising the funds necessary for an exhibit.  He requested that he be furnished with printed matter for the information of the members and for distribution.</p>
                            <p>Information comes from New York that Governor Black is selecting the men for the New York Exposition commission and will make public announcement of the appointments within a few days.  The governor has announced his intention of selecting men of high standing in the several communities of the state who will take energetic action in the matter and see that the state is properly represented.</p>
                            <p>Commissioner Peabody of Florida writes to the Department of Publicity and Promotion that the recent freeze of the orange crop has given the enthusiasm of the people in the exposition project a severe frost and he says the stricken districts will probably not make an exhibit.  The other counties, he says, will make good exhibits and the state will be creditably represented, but the idea of a state building will probably be abandoned.</p>

                            <p>One of the features of the exhibit which will be made by the counties in the Arkansas valley of Colorado will be a relief map 10x40 feet, showing the rivers, streams and irrigation ditches of running water.  The valley is shaped like a cornucopia, being but a few miles in width at the upper end and broadening to a width of 150 miles at the mouth of the horn, 250 miles from the apex.  This cornucopia will appear on all the printed matter sent out by the Arkansas Valley association.</p>
                            <p>E. B. T. Spencer, secretary of the faculty of the University of Denver, has applied to the Colorado Exposition commission for space for an exhibit in the Denver display.</p>
                            <p>The Kansas City Star endorses the efforts of the Missouri exposition to raise a fund of $50,000 for state participation.  It says the amount is very low and is cheap, considering the amount of advertising the state will receive, and remarks that it should be all arranged for within two weeks.</p>
                            <p>Graham county, Kansas, is preparing to make a county exhibit in a sod house built of sod cut in that county.  D. C. Kay, ex-county clerk of Graham county, is at the head of this enterprise.</p>
                            <p>The subcommittee of the Georgia Exposition commission appointed to confer with the lumbermen of the state is actively at work canvassing the lumber interests and ascertaining how much lumber each firm will contribute toward the erection of the Georgia pine palace.  The commission will meet at Macon January 26, when it is expected that replies will have been received from all points and that definite action can be taken at that time.</p>
                            <p>The New Jersey Exposition commission has decided to ask the legislature to appropriate $20,000 for a state building and exhibit.</p>

                            <p>Vice President H. B. Maxson of Nevada writes to the Department of Publicity and Promotion from his home at Reno that he has reason to feel very much encouraged at the outlook for a creditable exhibit from Nevada, showing the resources of that little understood region.  In a letter addressed to Manager Rosewater he says: "I can now assure you of an exhibit from Nevada and it will not be a 6x10-foot cabinet, either; but I think I can promise you exhibits from Nevada that will fill at least one car and in order to help matters along I will come to Omaha soon and report in person to the management.  I have already secured several private cabinets as well as specimens from several mines.  I have also secured from the State university its entire exhibit, which was exhibited at Chicago, and have the promise of one of our cattle kings that he will make application through me in a few days for space for him to exhibit some thoroughbred Hereford cattle from his breeding farm in this county.  Everything that I secure will be in the form of a state exhibit, as everything will be strictly Nevada productions.  I desire some space in the Agriculture building for state exhibits, as the State university will have quite a display of products raised on the state experimental grounds.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Several Very Important Matters Up for Discussion.</head>
                            <p>The storm of yesterday afternoon affected the attendance at the Woman's club and the gathering was the smallest of the year.  The business, however, proved to be more interesting than usual.  The library committee reported through its chairman, Mrs. Sudborough, that it had made selection of books, subject to the requests of the respective departments, and that most of them were to be found in the bookcases.  The committee had also chosen several valuable reference books, which would be found useful by all the study classes.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Damon presented the report of Miss Bertha Burket, who represents the club as the "Traveler's Aid" at the union station.  It was a simple rehearsal of the many-sided work that has been done during the year, of physical necessities relieved, of lodgings, food and car fare provided, of direction given to ignorant and protection given to the young, of work procured and homes found, of information sent to relatives, and of general preventive effort.  The report was its own appeal, but it was supplemented by some strong words from Mrs. G. W. Clarke, chairman of the committee with which Miss Burket is most closely identified.  There was some discussion upon the report, after which it was voted that Miss Burket by continued as "tra<unclear/> another year, with an <unclear/></p>

                            <p>At the request of the directory Mrs. Harford then laid before the club an important matter.  She stated that a committee from the Bureau of Education of the exposition had been looking for a suitable meeting place for the congresses which that department has in charge, and that the trustees of the First Congregational church had been considering the question of renting their building for the purpose for some time, and that favorable action had been taken within a few days.  She stated that the club had certain rights in the church for club purposes during the summer, and that it had been suggested that it assume the entire rent of the building as its contribution to the exposition.  It would then become the hostess of the congresses of that part of the exposition which is educational, and which is, therefore, in line with the intellectual element for which the club stands in the community.  She named the sum required above that for which the club is already obligated as $1,290, and asked that the question of assuming this responsibility be considered.  Mrs. Sudborough expressed the thought that the matter was too important for hasty action, and especially that it should <choice><sic>no</sic><corr>not</corr></choice> be settled when so many of the club were not present, and on her motion the matter was made the order of the day for the next meeting, February 7.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The German-Americans will not be the only pebbles on the gymnastic beach during the summer, with their big Transmississippi turnfest.  The Bohemian-Americans will have about the same time a tournament of just as big scope and interest.  This latter project is now as far advanced as the other, and, therefore, during the coming summer Omaha is certain to have two big gymnastic tournaments of national importance.</p>
                            <p>The Bohemian-American games will be held in connection with the national meeting of the Telocvicno Jednota Sokel, better known as the Tel Jed Sokel.  This body includes in its membership sokels or Bohemian gymnastic societies all over the United States.  This business meeting is held but once in four years.  It was to have taken place last year in this city, but at the request of the local membership it was postponed until this year in order that it might be held during the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Ordinarily there is no tournament held in connection with this business meeting.  As in the case of the German turning societies, the games are usually held separately.  Last year the national tournament was to have taken place in St. Louis, but the disastrous cyclone that visited that city and destroyed the Eads bridge also blew down the building of the St. Louis sokol, and, therefore, no national tournament was held.</p>
                            <p>The fact that the national business meeting is to be held here and that last year's tournament was not held, suggested the idea to the local members of the organizations to hold games in this city in connection with the meeting.  The matter was called to the attention of the business body of the western district, which takes in the states of Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri and Iowa, and the headquarters of which are located in this city.</p>

                            <p>Omaha had some trouble in getting the tournament.  St. Louis wanted it in lieu of the national games it was to have had last year.  Other cities were after it.  Omaha was further handicapped from the fact that three years ago the tournament of the western district was held in this city.  The selection of the place of holding the tournament was finally left to a vote of the members of the district.  This vote has just been concluded and has resulted in the selection of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>While the tournament is nominally that of the western district, the local members of the society intend to make its scope much bigger.  They are inviting sokols all over the west to join and they are securing gratifying responses.  <choice><sic>t iIs</sic><corr>It is</corr></choice> believed that Chicago will also come in and there is no question that societies from the more eastern cities will send teams to participate in the games.  The teams which will compete will have a membership of several hundred.  The business meeting of the national body and the games will call to this city about 500 delegates and contestants.  It is certain, however, that thousands of Bohemian-Americans from the western section of the country and from the entire United States will be attracted to the city.</p>
                            <p>So far but the bare outline of the project has been mapped out.  The meeting and tournament will probably cover a week, the latter following the former.  It is proposed that one day of this week shall be Bohemian day on the exposition grounds.  The dates have not yet been fixed, but a committee is working on that now.  It is quite possible that the week following the German turnfest will be selected.  It has <unclear/> it would be a good idea <unclear/> turnfest and the <unclear/></p>

                            <head type="sub">Secretary of the Interior Thinks the Proposed Congress Will Prove an Attractive Feature of the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 25.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Secretary Bliss is committed to induce congress to pass the bill now pending before the committee on Indian affairs of the house.  Senator Thurston and Representative Mercer had a conference with the secretary of the interior this morning and after an explanation of rumors which seemed likely to seriously affect a favorable report from the Indian affairs committee, Secretary Bliss informed the delegation that he would do whatever possible to advance the project, as he believed it would be of advantage to the department and to wards of the government.  He questioned whether much of a show could be made for $45,000, but thought if carefully managed it would be one of the greatest features of the exposition.  He stated that the Indians would be in charge of a regular army officer, which would greatly reduce the friction between representatives of the different tribes and eliminate the objection that different nationalities could not abide together in amity.  Secretary Bliss gave notice that he would ask for the assignment of Captain William Mercer, in charge of the Omaha and Winnebago agency, to this feature of the exposition, which was heartily concurred in by Senator Thurston and Mr. Mercer.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Bliss has received a dispatch from City Attorney Connell stating that a building had been rented for an Indian supply depot and that everything was in readiness for the government to occupy the same.  The secretary stated that he would at once give the necessary instructions for the government to occupy the property, although he was of the impression that there would not be any necessity for the building until the beginning of the next fiscal year, but thought the building could be most advantageously used as a storage house for the Indian exhibit of the Omaha exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Preparations for an Exhibit Worthy of the State.</head>
                            <ab>St. Louis Globe Democrat.</ab>
                            <div3>
                            <p>It is well that Missouri has been aroused to the necessity of a suitable representation at the Transmississippi Exposition to begin at Omaha June 1 and remain open for the ensuing five months.  The matter rests with the public spirit of the people of the state, for the legislature was so deeply absorbed in other subjects that it failed to make an appropriation and has probably just heard that there is to be a great international show this year on the west bank of the Missouri river.  It will be, beyond doubt, one of the greatest exhibitions ever held in the country.  The work of preparation, now far advanced, insures this result.  A mild winter has favored the erection of the large group of buildings and several are substantially complete.  The government appropriated $200,000 for the exposition, Nebraska $100,000, Illinois $45,000, California $75,000, Montana $30,000 and Iowa, Colorado and Utah voted to participate.  Although Missouri is by far the most populous and wealthiest transmississippi state, its legislature appropriated nothing, but then the somnolent effect of bourbonism must be considered.  When some two-penny advantage in electioneering is not before them the Missouri legislators can usually be heard snoring in Sleepy Hollow.</p>
                            <p>But the people of Missouri are not asleep.  They propose to be heard from at Omaha.  A state commission has been formed and has organized by the appointment of committees on agriculture, live stock, horticulture, mines, forestry, manufactures, transportation and finance.  They have appealed to Missourians for the financial aid required and the response is encouraging.  The managers at Omaha have allotted ample space.  Two Missouri buildings will be erected, one for an exhibit, the other for the accommodation of state visitors.  One of the exhibits decided on is a corn pyramid.  Of course the minerals of Missouri will be prominent in its display.  This state will also have a great opportunity in the series of fruit carnivals to extend throughout the entire five months.  The Missouri commission says in its appeal: "We hope to make the finest exhibit of fruits ever seen in America; to collect and place on exhibition meritorious products of our farms, forests, mines and factories," and they truly remark that exhibitors will have the world for an audience.</p>
                            <p>The coming exposition originated in resolutions adopted by the Transmississippi congress at Omaha in 1895, representing twenty-four states and territories.  In addition to Nebraska's $100,000, the country of Douglas, in which Omaha is situated, appropriated $100,000 in bonds, and the citizens of Omaha subscribed $1,000,000 as a guaranty fund.  The government appropriation of $200,000 will include a building for government exhibits and a lifesaving service building.  An irrigation exhibit will embrace forty different methods.  The site for the show is 220 acres in the northern part of the city.  The great buildings are on both <unclear/>d with<unclear/></p>
                            <p>C. A. Atkinson of Lincoln has, upon the request of the War department, through the active efforts of Senator Thurston, been appointed special attorney to assist the United States district attorney of Illinois in preparing papers looking to condemnation of land for the Hennepin canal, extending from Chicago to the Mississippi river, about five miles of which has been built.  Atkinson will be ordered to report to the United States district attorney shortly.</p>

                            <p>Bids were opened today in the office of the supervising architect for the completion of the interior finish, iron stairs and plumbing above the first story on the Omaha public building.  The lowest bid, $79,497, was received from Angus McLeod Co. of Minneapolis, and the highest, $111,499, from A. W. Phelps &amp; Son of Omaha.  Other Omaha bidders were B. J. Jobst, $89,998; Mahoney &amp; Wakefield, $99,960; Hamilton Brothers, $96,500; Walter Petersen, $93,880; Henry Hamann, $94,440.</p>
                            <p>Senator Allen introduced papers in relation to the continuance of the fiber investigation on the part of the Agricultural department, also an amendment to the sundry civil bill appropriating a sum of money for the rent of old buildings on the present site of Fort Crook for Henry T. Clarke.</p>
                            <p>Mercer filed a petition of citizens of Omaha in favor of the immigration bill.</p>
                            <p>The supervising architect today allowed B. J. Jobst of Omaha $62.50 additional on his contract for furnishing locks and bolts for doors on the Omaha public building.</p>

                            <p>Assistant Secretary Meiklejohn gave notice that nothing would be done looking to the abandonment of Fort Mead, S. D., until the officials of the Fremont, Elkhorn &amp; Missouri Valley railroad could be heard on the same.</p>
                            <p>The report of the condition of national banks in Iowa at the close of business on January 15 has been received by the comptroller of the of the currency, and, compared with the last reports in October, shows that the banks have strengthened their loans and discounts, while a shrinkage is noticed in the average reserves.  The loans and discounts, according to the October statement, were $29,599,784, against $30,591,016 in the current report.  The individual deposits have been increased from $25,919,830 in October to $26,945,573.  The average reserve held by the banks is 31.33 per cent, a reduction of 2.19 per cent since October.  The present holdings of gold coin in the banks is $1,524,633, an increase of more than $35,000 over the last statement.</p>

                            <p>About 100 members of the Nebraska Press association arrived in the city this morning on the regular Burlington train from Lincoln for the purpose of informing themselves as to the present status of the exposition.  The annual meeting of the association was closed at Lincoln yesterday and nearly every member joined the party which came to Omaha today.  There were a number of women in the delegation, some of them being wives of the members and others being active members of the association on their own account.</p>
                            <p>Special cars were in waiting at the depot to take the party to the exposition grounds, and the trip to that point was made without incident.  The main court was first visited and the visitors made the circuit of the court, passing through the several main buildings and visiting the staff shops.  Some time was spent in this manner and the visitors commented very freely on the progress which was in evidence.  The general opinion was one of astonishment and wonder at the magnitude of the enterprise and the progress which has been made.  The bluff tract was visited, after which the party boarded the cars again and made a flying trip to South Omaha to visit the stock yards.</p>
                            <p>The train on which many of the visitors desired to return to their homes was scheduled to leave the depot at 2:55 p. m., and there was little time for formalities.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles made a short talk to the guests, welcoming them to the city and expressing the wish that they would see the exposition as a matter in which the entire state is interested.  Ex-President Kimmel of the Press association and Edgar Howard of Papillion made short talks in which they expressed their conviction that the exposition was bound to be a great success and a lasting benefit to the state.  They gave assurance that the members of the Press association will not be backward in aiding the exposition in every possible way.</p>

                            <p>Although it is more than four months before the date set for the opening of the gates of the Transmississippi and International Exposition, Omaha is already the Mecca of large bodies of people drawn hither by the exposition.  They come from all quarters of the Union and represent a great variety of interests, but all are actuated by one motive, viz: to learn by actual observation the exact status of the exposition and to make arrangements for representation by the section of country represented by them.  A number of these delegations have visited the city within the last few weeks and others are expected in the near future.  Judging from the unanimous expressions of the delegations which have preceded then the expected visitors will find that their most flattering anticipations will be more than realized.</p>
                            <p>Thirty-two business men from St. Joseph, Mo., will arrive in the city tomorrow to visit the exposition grounds and offices and confer with the exposition grounds and offices and confer with the exposition officials regarding representation for their city and state.</p>
                            <p>Saturday morning a party consisting of nearly the entire legislature of Iowa will come to Omaha to look into the exposition situation, in connection with the application of the Iowa Exposition commission for an additional appropriation for state representation.</p>
                            <p>Thursday of next week a delegation of members of the Minnesota exposition, prominent business men and press representatives to the number of about thirty, will visit Omaha for the purpose of informing themselves regarding the situation in order that the work of the commission may be more intelligently directed and local interest aroused in the matter of state representation.</p>
                            <p>Two representatives of the Louisiana State Board of Agriculture, which has charge of the matter of making a state exhibit, will be in the city early in February on a similar errand, and arrangements are now being perfected for a trip to Omaha by the New Jersey Exposition commission.  The exact date for this last named party has not been fixed, but the matter is in the hands of the Department of Publicity and Promotion and is being arranged by its eastern agent.</p>

He says the commission is holding meetings and is resorting to every known method to raise funds to enable it to make a creditable exhibit, but he does not express any strong hope of success in this direction.  He says, however, that the state will be represented in a manner which will be a credit to its magnificent resources, as the seven counties in the Arkansas valley have perfected an organization for making an exhibit of the fruits and other products of that region, the eleven counties on the "western slope" having done likewise, and the city of Denver has a commission of its own which will erect a building and make a display of Colorado products.  In addition to this Secretary Mischke says that Mining Commissioner Lee will install the fine mineral exhibit belonging to the state, which is said to be one of the most extensive and costly collections ever exhibited in this country.</p>

                            <p>The newly created Bureau of Public Comfort of the Transmississippi Exposition held its first meeting in the offices of the Ways and Means committee in the Paxton block last night.  The following members of the bureau were present: Dudley Smith, Major R. S. Wilcox, A. C. Smith and C. M. Wilhelm.  The bureau organized by electing Dudley Smith as chairman and C. M. Wilhelm secretary.  It also decided upon a general plan for conducting its duties, but this plan must be submitted to the Ways and Means committee of the exposition directory for approval.  The bureau is a subcommittee of this body and can only make recommendations.</p>
                            <p>In the report that the bureau will make to the next meeting of the committee will be a recommendation that a permanent quarters for an information bureau be established in some large room or building in the central part of the city.  If this recommendation is adopted the bureau will go to work immediately to make the selection in order that the quarters may be established as soon as possible.</p>
                            <p>It is also recommended that the information office be under the direct supervision of the exposition directory.  No authority is to be given to any outside project to use the name Transmississippi or Exposition in connection with any information bureau scheme that may be launched.</p>
                            <p>All hotels, boarding houses and other establishments which expect to provide accommodations for visitors to the exposition are to be requested to file a list of their accommodations and the schedules of prices they intend to maintain during the exposition with the bureau.  Emphasis is to be laid on the latter provision.  It is not desired that visitors to the city should be "held up" for lodging and it is for this reason that the schedule of prices is wanted now.  This and other information is to be sent to the "Bureau of Public Comfort, Postoffice Box No. 12, Omaha."</p>
                            <p>The bureau also determined that it would be a good plan for the members to visit all the hotels in the city for the purpose of impressing the proprietors with the necessity of treating their guests fairly and reasonably during the exposition.  It was decided to meet every Wednesday night in the offices of the Ways and Means committee in the Paxton block, until the permanent quarters are secured.</p>
                            <p>The Bland Directory company, which has been soliciting with much success among the residents on the matter of listing rooms, etc., has no connection with the exposition.  It is a purely private enterprise.</p>

                            <p>President Wattles is preparing to recommend to the executive committee the organization of a military department similar to the one at the Tennessee exposition.  He says he is in receipt of a number of letters from various military officials in different states inquiring as to the provisions that will be made for the accommodation of the militia of those states in case it is decided to hold their annual encampment at Omaha, instead of at the usual camping ground.  A letter of this kind was received by the president this morning from Colonel J. A. Corby, commanding the Fourth regiment of infantry of the Missouri National Guard.  This letter was sent to the president through Adjutant General Barry of this state, and states that a meeting of the commanding officers of each regiment and battery of the Missouri National Guard has been called by Brigadier General Moore, to be held at Kansas City next week, to consider the proposition from St. Joseph to hold the annual encampment at that point.  Colonel Corby asks what inducements Omaha is holding out for the encampment of the whole brigade, or for detachments.  Similar letters have been received from officers of the national guard in other states and also from the cadets of the University of Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>At the Nashville Exposition a department was organized to furnish accommodations for bodies of troops desiring to camp at or near the exposition and certain of the camp equipment was furnished by the exposition authorities.  This department was under the direction of Captain H. C. Ward, the officer detailed by the War department in charge of the exhibit made by the department at Nashville and at Omaha.  The report of the operations of this department made by Captain Ward shows it to have been a great success in every sense.  President Wattles has written to Captain Ward to ascertain when he will arrive in Omaha and will consult him regarding the details of such a department<unclear/></p>
                            <p>The president suggests that the Fort Omaha reservation, which will probably be turned over to the exposition authorities, will make an excellent camping ground for the purpose suggested and could be utilized with little expense to the exposition.</p>

Wharton, Special Agent McAusland and Vice President Parsons have been engaged for the last two or three weeks in working up an interest in the matter and, as a result, the newspapers of San Francisco are devoting considerable space in their columns to the exposition and the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce has passed a resolution endorsing the exposition and declaring that it deserves the support of all sections of California.</p>

                            <p>A bill was introduced in the legislature of New Jersey yesterday to provide for a state appropriation for a state building and participation in the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee yesterday approved a contract with the General Electric company of Schenectady, N. Y., for a number of dynamos, arc lamps and other equipment required for lighting the exposition grounds and buildings.</p>

The special Rock Island train bearing the Iowa party will leave Des Moines about 8 a. m. Saturday and will arrive in Omaha shortly before noon.  This train will leave Omaha on the return trip at 5 p. m.</p>
                            <p>H. D. Fisher of Florence, Wis., a member of the Wisconsin Exposition commission, has been appointed by Chairman Koch as superintendent of the Wisconsin building at the exposition.  Mr. Fisher was in Omaha some time ago and selected the site for the building and he has since been soliciting the lumbermen of Wisconsin to furnish the material for the construction of the building.  It is reported from that state that the lumbermen have donated all the material required.</p>
                            <p>The Georgia Exposition commission has issued an address to the people of the state setting forth in detail the extent of the exposition, the population represented by the states which will participate, the advantages which will accrue to Georgia from a good representation in the exhibit buildings and appealing to the people to contribute to a fund for the erection of a state building and other necessary expenses.  The commission estimates that about $10,000 will be required to erect the building and install the fine exhibit owned by the state, including such additions to this exhibit as may be necessary.</p>
                            <p>The north wing of the Government building will be under roof within the next ten days.  The roof trusses are in position on this wing and those on the south wing are being raised.  The placing of the iron columns, which will support the dome, is well under way.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Submitted to the Postmaster General for Approval.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 27.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Chief Johnson, of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, today submitted to the postmaster general for approval, designs of stamps to be issued to commemorate the Omaha exposition.  The designs are splendid specimens of workmanship and will probably be adopted by the postmaster general.  Those submitted today were three in number and represented farming scenes, an Indian chief and herds of cattle.</p>
                            <p>The clay models for the exterior fancy work on the government building at the Omaha exposition will be shipped tomorrow.  This consignment comprises the largest portion models and the balances will be shipped at an early day.</p>
                            <p>The Nebraska delegation appeared before the subcommittee on Indian affairs this morning having in charge the Indian congress bill.  The subcommittee, consisting of Curtis, Fisher and Benton was addressed by Senator Allen, Representatives Mercer, Greene and Maxwell.  They outlined the scope of the proposed Indian congress and the benefits which would accrue to both the Indians and the white people if the government should conclude to bring representative Indian families together during the Omaha exposition.  It is not altogether certain that the bill will be reported favorably by the committee, the feeling being that the government cannot afford to appropriate money beyond the receipts for purposes of the kind outlined by the proposed bill.  However, strenuous efforts will be made in behalf of the measure, failing in which Senators Allen and Thurston will endeavor to place an amendment upon the Indian bill when it reaches the senate, appropriating $45,000 for this Indian congress, and there is every reason to believe that if the senate takes the initiative, the house conferees will not particularly object to its remaining on the bill.</p>

                            <p>Tomorrow will be Iowa day in exposition circles.  It is expected that nearly all the members of the legislature and various state officers of that commonwealth, together with a number of newspaper correspondents, will visit Omaha tomorrow to inspect the exposition in all its phases and learn just what is being done in the way of preparing for the occasion.  Present indications are that there will be about 200 persons in the party.  They will leave Des Moines on a special train over the Rock Island road at 8 a. m., and will arrive in Omaha about 11 o'clock.  They will be met at the depot by a special committee, and will board special cars, which will be in waiting at the depot, going at once to the exposition grounds.  After the buildings and grounds have been fully inspected, the party will proceed to one of the hotels, where lunch will be served and further details regarding the exposition will be explained.</p>
                            <p>The full Board of Directors of the exposition has been designated by President Wattles as a committee to receive the visitors at the depot and accompany them to the exposition grounds and to lunch.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Decide to Put Out Another Button with Bas Relief of the Wigwam&#8212;Close the Deal for a Location.</head>
                            <p>The big tepee and how to build it was the subject for a good deal of earnest discussion at the regular meeting of the executive committee of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi Exposition last night.  The report of the button committee did not show a favorable condition of things so far as the financial part the button was to play in the work of raising funds for the wigwam, and there was a general discussion of methods for raising the money.  Reports from the country indicated that a great many buttons could be sold throughout the county if the button was less distinctively a Council Bluffs affair, and it was decided to get out another button that would be several times larger than the present neat and handsome little affair and that should contain a bas relief image of the wigwam.  It was estimated that this button could be gotten out within three weeks, and Secretary Judson and the button committee were instructed to have it ready for the market in the shortest possible time.  Lucius Wells doubted that plan of urging the wholesale and other business houses to force the buttons upon their customers and commercial travelers for the reason that it might interfere with the sale of goods.  He favored the plan of strengthening the solicitation committee and securing pledges of the amount required.  Leonard Everett believed that the button idea was still the most feasible one, and declared that as Kansas City had raised $50,000 by it Council Bluffs ought to raise at least $5,000.</p>
                            <p>The committee on wigwam location reported that the exposition management had notified it that the site selected for the wigwam must be taken at once and a definite answer returned by 5 o'clock this evening.  Other parties were after it with an offer of $2,500 for it.  It was decided to instruct the committee to close the deal at once and pledge the association to pay the amount required.  The committee reported that the price was to be $1,000 if an exhibit was to be put in and nothing if the big and unique structure was to be used as a "home" for the Pottawattamies and their friends.  The importance of going ahead and getting the wigwam built at the earliest possible moment was discussed at length.  Dr. Hanchett said it was an enterprise that had been heralded all over the country and had been advertised almost as much as the exposition itself.  A failure to erect it or any material modification of the plans would cause Council Bluffs to be laughed to scorn.  The sentiment of the entire committee was that the work should go on and that there should be no slighting in any part of it.</p>
                            <p>An invitation was presented by George F. Wright from President Wattles inviting the entire committee of fifty to accompany the members of the Iowa legislature to Omaha when they reach here on Saturday.  The importance of showing the hearty accord of the people of Council Bluffs with the exposition was discussed fully, and it was decided to have the secretary invite a number of other leading citizens to join the party and impress upon every person the necessity for using his influence with the assemblymen whom he might know the importance of having a liberal appropriation.  The committee and the citizens will meet at the corner of Pearl street and Broadway at the hour to be given in the morning papers tomorrow.</p>

                            <p>A delegation of twenty-five of the representative business and professional men of St. Joseph, Mo., arrived in the city this morning for the purpose of investigating for themselves the exact status of the exposition and the preparations which are being made for the great show.  They arrived at 6:30 a. m., and were met at the depot by R. W. Richardson and Dudley Smith of the reception committee, who escorted them to the Millard hotel.  At 10 o'clock the remainder of the reception committee, including President Wattles, Warren Switzler, H. W. Bates, W. S. Poppleton, G. M. Hitchcock, F. H. Davis and G. W. Lininger, assembled at the hotel, and went directly to the exposition grounds.  All the points of interest about the grounds were visited, about an hour being consumed in this way.  Like all the other visitors from a distance, the members of the visiting delegation, without exception, expressed great surprise at the large scale on which the whole enterprise is being carried out.  They plied the local committee with questions regarding the status of affairs in the several departments, and manifested great interest in all that pertained to the matter.</p>
                            <p>After the buildings and grounds had been fully inspected the special lunch was served at the Omaha club.</p>
                            <p>Two of the St. Joseph party, F. W. Maxwell and R. M. Davis, are members of the Missouri Exposition Commission, and were with the commission when it visited Omaha earlier in the month.  They acquired considerable enthusiasm regarding the exposition on that occasion and were loud in their praise of the enterprise and the progress which had been made, together with the importance of the many interests of St. Joseph who had not been in Omaha to see for themselves and out of this suspicion grew the present visit.  Mr. Maxwell is secretary of the Commercial club of St. Joseph and Mr. Davis is president of the R. T. Davis Milling company, a concern well known in this section by some of its products.</p>

                            <p>Speaking of the feeling in St. Joseph, Mr. Maxwell said, "Our people are considerably interested in the exposition, but they do not appreciate the grand scale on which the people of Omaha are preparing for that affair.  When I returned from my trip here with the Missouri commission, I was filled with enthusiasm for the <choice><sic>expostiion</sic><corr>exposition</corr></choice> and the importance of our people being well represented and commenced talking exposition to everybody.  They soon commenced to say 'Oh, those Omaha people simply hypnotized you,' and they refused to believe that the advertising matter and pictures your Publicity department is sending out are actual representations of what the buildings are to be, and they regard the bird's-eye view as a freak of the imagination.  I told them that the only thing on the picture that I did not see in course of preparation was the flying machine, and I thought probably you had that concealed somewhere about the grounds.  It was finally decided that the best thing to do would be to bring up some of our most prominent business men up here to see for themselves, and they are here.</p>
                            <p>"We have a local exposition commission," continued Mr. Maxwell, "and our manufacturing interests will be well represented.  Our commission numbers six members, three of whom are in our party.  The members are L. C. Burns, president, Frank Freytag, R. M. Davis, E. T. Abbott, Louis Hax, sr., and myself."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Davis is making preparations to make a large exhibit of the products of the R. T. Davis Milling company, negotiations with the Department of Exhibits having been in progress for some time.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Executive Committee Arranges to Give Manufacturers More Room.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee of the exposition has changed the designation of two of the main buildings in the main court and hereafter the building at the southeast corner of the lagoon, which has been known and designated as the Mines and Mining building, while the large building at the east side of the Administration arch on the north side of the lagoon will be known as the Manufactures building.</p>
                            <p>This change was made on account of the great press of applications for space in the manufactures display.  It has been apparent for some time that the Manufactures building was entirely too small for the purpose for which it was intended, and no practicable plan has been devised for enlarging the building.  The Liberal Arts building was planned and erected near the Manufactures building as one means of relieving the pressure, but this was not sufficient and the demand for more space has been pressing for some time.  The Department of Exhibits reports that after leaving out of consideration all the exhibits which might be considered undesirable for any reason and confining exhibitors to the smallest space commensurate with their proposed exhibit there still remain applications for space at least 25 per cent in excess of the capacity of the Manufactures and Liberal Arts buildings combined, and more applications for space coming in daily.</p>
                            <p>In view of these conditions the executive committee, at its meeting yesterday, decided to change the names of the buildings as stated heretofore.  The decoration of the Mines building, which has especial reference to the mining industry, will be transferred to the Manufactures building and the space thus left will be filled with other ornamentation in keeping with the new character which will be given to the building.  With this exception no changes will be made in either building and there will be nothing about either to indicate that any change was made.</p>
                            <p>The new Manufactures building will have fully one-third more floor space than the one first designated by that name and there will be ample opportunity for extending this building toward the north along the east side of Twentieth street.  While no definite plan of this kind has been officially decided upon, it is probable that a wing will be constructed to this building as suggested and this will be assigned to the foreign exhibitors, of whom there will be a large number.</p>

                            <p>The bill introduced in the New Jersey legislature, providing for an appropriation for a state building to be erected on the exposition grounds, does not specify the amount to be appropriated, the amount being left blank at the suggestion of members of the senate committee on appropriations, there being some difference of opinion as to whether the amount should be $10,000 or $20,000.  The matter of promoting the passage of this bill is in the hands of Chairman Robert Mitchell Floyd of Jersey City and E. O. Halstead of Omaha, the representative of the Department of Publicity and Promotion who has been in New Jersey for several weeks assisting the New Jersey commission in its work of securing a large and creditable exhibit of the resources of the state.  It is reported that there is little doubt about the bill going through with at least $10,000.  All of the leading papers of the state are giving the matter their strongest support.</p>

                            <p>In commenting upon the protests of the stamp collectors against the issue of a set of special stamps commemorative of the exposition, Harper's Weekly says:</p>
                            <p>This protest seems not altogether unreasonable.  Of course the Postoffice department ought not to issue new kinds of stamps for the purpose of catching the pennies of collectors.  It is too big a concern for that sort of expedient, even though, as now, it is hard up.  Doubtless considerations of profit have had very little to do with the project of the new issue.  That issue is called commemorative, but what it really seems to be is an advertisement of the Omaha fair.  The impression made is that the government wanted to help the fair and agreed to advertise it through the postoffice, which would cost nothing and would amuse the people.  From the philatelist's point of view that seems reprehensible.  The issue, however, won't bother any one except the stamp collectors, and the average citizen, who wants the Omaha fair to succeed, will not disturb his mind with considering whether that Postoffice department is not going outside it legitimate business in advertising even an enterprise of national moment like a transmississippi exposition.</p>

                            <p>Some brief facts for the consideration of Iowa people are here epitomized:</p>
                            <p>The state of Illinois by act of its legislature appropriated $45,000 and the commissioners appointed by the governor in accordance with the act of the legislature visited Omaha three months ago and selected a site for their building, which building is now in process of construction and it will be a fine one.</p>
                            <p>The governor of the state of New York is just about to appoint a commission.</p>
                            <p>The governor of the state of New Jersey has appointed a commission and an appropriation bill is pending in the legislature for a state exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The state of Wisconsin has a state commission, whose representatives have visited Omaha, examined the exposition grounds, selected a location for its building and beyond question $30,000 will be raised for that exhibit.</p>
                            <p>The state of Nebraska appropriated by legislative action $100,000.</p>
                            <p>The legislature of the state of Montana appropriated $15,000 and private subscriptions have added to that $15,000, making $30,000.</p>
                            <p>The state of Utah, by legislative action, appropriated $7,500, but its World's Fair exhibit is to be turned over to the Transmississippi and International Exposition, which should bring that exhibit up to $25,000.</p>
                            <p>The state of Missouri made no legislative appropriation for reason that there is no session of the legislature in that state this winter, but the governor of the state appointed a commission, sixty-two in number of which visited the exposition grounds two weeks ago and after looking everything over thoroughly the delegation resolved to raise $50,000 for an exhibit of the products of Missouri.</p>
                            <p>The state of Colorado has no session of its legislature this winter, and consequently can make no appropriation, but a commission has already been appointed by the governor and a very extensive exhibit will be made.</p>
                            <p>The territory of New Mexico made an appropriation of $1,500 and a commission has been appointed to arrange for an exhibit through private subscription.</p>
                            <p>The state of Kansas has no session of the legislature this year and as a consequence must rely on private subscription, which already reaches $20,000.</p>
                            <p>The state of Louisiana one year ago by resolution of its legislature instructed the State Bureau of Agriculture to arrange for a creditable exhibit, which it is understood will figure an expenditure of $30,000.</p>
                            <p>The state of Arkansas, through its proper officers, sent a representative here to ascertain what was being done at the Transmississippi and International Exposition, with instructions to report to the governor and upon receipt of this report the governor has appointed a commission to arrange for an exhibit.</p>
                            <p>A commission has already been appointed by the governor of the state of Texas, the commission being composed of members from each senatorial district of the state and it is understood that each and every one of them shall make an effort for subscriptions in his own district.</p>

                            <head type="sub">VITALLY CONCERN THE CITY LEVY</head>
                            <head type="sub">Funding Bonds to Take Up the Overlaps and Counting as Cash Uncollected Taxes Bother Finance Committee.</head>
                            <p>An informal session of the city council has been called this afternoon to discuss the tax levy and also the question of issuing refunding bonds to relieve the various funds from the burden of unpaid warrants which remain as a legacy from previous years.  As stated by Chairman Burkley of the finance committee, there are two questions that must be decided before the council will be in a position to make a figure on the levy.  One is the refunding proposition, and the other is whether the balances now indicated by the books of the comptroller shall be recognized as the available balances against which warrants may be drawn.  The present balances are those which result from the addition of the uncollected tax balances of the last four years to the balances that previously existed.  Mayor Moores and some of that councilmen have been inclined to think that these very theoretical balances should not be considered as available funds, and in connection with the levy the question becomes a live issue.  The estimates submitted by the comptroller assume that all outstanding warrants will be taken care of by refunding the bonds and also that the theoretical balances shall be considered as the correct balances in the various funds.  On this basis of calculation the aggregate estimate involves a levy of over 30 mills and if the outstanding warrants or the differences between the old and new balances were to be considered, the amount would be largely increased.  Chairman Burkley says that these two propositions must be absolutely settled before the council can act intelligently on the levy.  If it is decided to issue the bonds and continue the present balances there is a possibility that the levy can be brought down to 25 mills.  But if otherwise, Mr. Burkley says a much larger levy would be necessary.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Health Officers of the City Turn in Their Reviews to the Mayor.</head>
                            <p>The last bunch of departmental reports has been filed with the city clerk and this completes the list with the exception of that of City Engineer Rosewater, which will be completed early next week.  The reports from the health department include those of Health Commissioner Spalding, Dr. Ralph, inspector of contagious diseases; City Veterinarian Ramacciotti and Milk Inspector Hutton.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Spalding briefly reviews the general work of the department calls attention to the necessity for several improvements.  He shows that the percentage of deaths from diphtheria in 1897 was 17.7 as compared with 22.4 in the previous year, and he considers the use of anti-toxin as responsible for the improvement.  The hospital bills amounted to $834.97, of which fully $150 was on account of cases that properly belonged to the county.  He contends that the necessities of the department require an ambulance and emergency hospital and meat inspector.</p>
                            <p>The report of the inspector of contagious diseases shows that there were 960 deaths from all cases during the year, which represents a death rate of 6.8 per thousand on a population of 140,000.  There were 219 cases of diphtheria with thirty-nine deaths and 134 cases of scarlatina with only nine deaths.  There were sixty-eight cases of enteric fever, of whom twenty-five died.  The number of births was 1,905 which was about the same as in the years immediately preceding.</p>
                            <p>The report of the milk inspector is based largely on the record left by S. L. Boyd, as the present inspector only served during the last month of the year.  It shows in detail the amount of work that was done during the year and that the receipts of the office amounted to $2,039.85.  The tests of the milk showed an average per cent of 3.5.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Ramacciotti calls attention to the necessity for some effective legislation to prevent the sale of diseased meat in the city.  He says that there are two slaughter houses, one at South Omaha and the other at Benson, which are largely responsible for the outrage.</p>
                            <p>The report of Clerk Clancey of the police court shows that there were 6,146 cases disposed of during the year, of which 432 were felonies.  There were 1,838 convictions and 4,308 dismissals.  Judge Gordon emphasizes the demand for a new jail and workhouse and also for a clearer definition of the powers of the garbage contractor.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Contributes $500 to the Fund for State's Exposition Display.</head>
                            <p>Governor Stephens of Missouri is supporting his faith with his works.  A dispatch to The Bee received last night says: "President Clark H. Sampson of the Missouri Omaha Exposition commission and R. A. Blossom of the executive committee, both of St. Louis, were in Jefferson City today in conference with Governor Stephens and Secretary Carroll, regarding the work of the committee.  They were greatly pleased with the present outlook for a splendid Missouri exhibit at Omaha.  Governor Stephens made a liberal donation to the fund, $500.</p>
                            <p>"Governor Stephens today appointed the following named gentlemen as additional members of the Missouri commission of the Omaha exposition: Hon. R. C. Morgan, Lamar; Judge Andrew Ellison, Kirksville; Ben P. White, Harrisonville; A. L. Walker, Louisiana: James Wheeless, St. Louis: Hon. E. M. Barber, Trenton; J. D. Allen, Butler; C. R. Walters, Rich Hill; Dr. J. J. Stevens, Clinton."</p>
                            <p>The St. Louis commission is losing no time, but is making as rapid preparations for the exposition as can be.  The Republic contains the following account of the meeting held Thursday night:</p>
                            <p>A well attended meeting of the St. Louis Transmississippi Exposition commission was held last night at the Mercantile club to further perfect arrangements for a befitting representation of the industries of St. Louis at the Transmississippi Exposition, to be held in Omaha during the present year from June to November.</p>
                            <p>Clark H. Sampson, president of the Missouri commission, presided at the meeting.  A number of answers to queries sent to a number of the leading business associations and mercantile concerns of the city were read by Secretary Starritt.  Of the answers read twenty-two concerns expressed their intentions of being represented at the exposition.  Among these were the Central Telephone and Electric company, B. T. Babbitt Soap company, Missouri Moline Plow company, Blackmer &amp; Post Pipe company, St. Louis Cycle company, Crown Linseed Oil company, A. D. Dozier, American Biscuit company, Kern Barber Supply company, Buck Stove and Range company, St. Louis Furniture company, Board of Trade, Spanish club, S. M. Fordyes, E. C. Sterling, R. A. Gardner, Charles E. Wenneker, Schulz Belting company, J. H. Conrades Chair company and several others.</p>
                            <p>The question of the amount of space required to effectively present the displays occupied considerable discussion.  The various concerns requested space ranging from 400 to 3,000 square feet.  An important feature developed during the discussion was that a number of Chicago shoe companies were trying to monopolize all the desirable space at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Sampson announced that a local shoe company had been in correspondence with the Omaha managers in this regard and received a reply of an unsatisfactory nature.  This led to a proposition that a committee be appointed to visit Omaha for the purpose of arranging for space and rates.  During the discussion it was stated that there seemed to be a disposition on the part of the management at Omaha to charge rates that were considered somewhat exorbitant.</p>
                            <p>A motion was made to the effect that such a committee be appointed by C. P. Walbridge, but it was sidetracked for another to the effect that a meeting of the exhibitors be called for next Thursday afternoon at 2 o'clock, to be held at the Mercantile club, when the committee could be more suitably selected.</p>
                            <p>The Missouri exhibits at Omaha, or at least the St. Louis portion, will probably be grouped.  This suggestion was made by J. W. Van Cleave, who thought the display could be made more conspicuous thereby.  The commission is very desirous that all prospective exhibitors give them definite answers as soon as possible, as the time limit for space is set for February 10, although this is not absolutely imperative.  It was stated, however, that the desirable space was being rapidly taken and that the sooner final arrangements were made the better it would be for all concerned.</p>
                            <p>President Sampson will leave for Jefferson City this morning to confer with Governor Stephens and Secretary Carroll of the commission in regard to the Missouri exhibit.  From the information they have at present in their possession, says Mr. Sampson, the Missouri display will be a creditable one.</p>
                            <p>A representative of the Trades and Labor assembly asked the commission's co-operation for an international exposition in 1903 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the purchase of Louisiana from the French government, and was informed that the matter would be considered later.</p>
                            <p>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., Jan. 28.&#8212;In reply to an inquiry by Secretary Carroll of the Missouri Transmississippi Exposition commission, the Omaha management advises him that the Missouri buildings at the exposition may be constructed entirely, interior and exterior, from Missouri pine, and it inclosed the following information, which should arouse Missouri lumbermen to action: "The subcommittee of the Georgia Exposition commission appointed to confer with the lumbermen of the state is actively at work canvassing the lumber interests and ascertaining how much lumber each firm will contribute toward the erection of the Georgia pine palace.  The commission will meet in Macon soon, when it is expected that replies will have been received from all points, and that definite action can be taken at that time."</p>

                            <p>A communication from the water company is in the hands of the committee, which is not looked upon favorably and it is the object of the meeting to get a general opinion as to the manner in which the exposition shall derive its water supply.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Governor L. M. Shaw and nearly 100 members of the Iowa legislature formed the nucleus of the party which arrived in the city on a special train via the Rock Island road this morning for the purpose of visiting the exposition grounds and learning the exact status of the Transmississippi and International Exposition in order that they may be able to vote intelligently on the request of the Iowa Exposition commission for an additional appropriation of $47,000 to enable the commission to make exhibits of the resources of the state at that exposition.  In addition to the governor and members of the legislature there were several other state officers in the party and a number of the party were accompanied by their wives.  The newspaper fraternity at the Iowa capital was well represented, there being nearly a dozen in the party.</p>
                            <p>The train bearing the large delegation steamed into the Tenth street depot at ll:15 a. m., and as the visitors alighted they were met by a reception committee composed of the full board of fifty directors of the exposition, together with the following citizens who are not members of the board: J. B. Sheehan, E. Benedict, Major T. S. Clarkson, Frank Colpetzer, Dr. S. R. Towne, A. R. Orcutt, B. H. Robison, R. F. Hodgins, J. H. Macumber, together with H. W. Macumber, W. L. Culberson and J. B. Hungerford of Carroll, Ia., and A. R. Anderson of Hot Springs, S. D.  To meet the women of the visiting delegation a special committee was on hand, consisting of Mrs. G. W. Wattles, wife of the president of the exposition; Mrs. W. P. Harford, chairman of the executive committee of the Woman's Board of Managers; Mrs. S. R. Towne, a director of the board; Mrs. Draper Smith, Mrs. A. L. Reed and Mrs. F. P. Kirkendall.</p>
                            <p>Carriages were at hand for the women and these were quickly filled, the men being cared for in a special motor train of six cars.  The trip to the exposition grounds was made without incident, carriages and cars arriving at the same time.</p>

                            <p>As their cars neared the exposition grounds the visitors caught sight of the buildings being erected on the bluff tract and it was evident from the remarks made in low tones by some of them that they concluded this was all there was of the exposition, and an expression of "I told you so," was plainly in evidence in more than one countenance.</p>
                            <p>Once inside the main court, however, the change was instantaneous.  Amazement and incredulity were mingled and questions were asked in profusion.</p>
                            <p>The crowd entered the Auditorium building first and a large male chorus which had been organized on the train after leaving Des Moines took possession of the stage and sang "The Song of Iowa" to the tune "My Maryland."  Leaving this building the party assembled in front of the Mines and Mining building, where President Wattles explained very briefly the names and purposes of all of the main buildings, after which each of the buildings were entered in turn and fully inspected.  The staff shops proved to be interesting spots for the visitors and the workmen were surrounded by curious groups watching the operation of making the white decoration which is to embellish the several buildings.</p>
                            <p>Every building in the main court was visited, and the visitors freely admitted that the sight was a great surprise to them and greatly exceeded their anticipations.  After the tour of this part of the grounds was completed the bluff tract was visited and the progress of the Nebraska and Illinois buildings and the Horticulture building noted.  The site selected by the Iowa commission for the Iowa building, the erection of which depends upon the action of the legislature, was shown to the visitors and many expressed the opinion that the site was a most desirable location.  The size and promised beauty of the two state buildings now nearing completion seemed to impress the Iowa solons with the importance of having a creditable building for their state.</p>
                            <p>The north tract was also visited and the proposed use of this great tract explained, after which the return trip was made, going direct to the Millard hotel.</p>

Governor Holcomb extended a welcome to the visitors on behalf of the state of Nebraska and Governor Shaw responded on behalf of the Iowa party.  J. M. Baldwin of Council Bluffs <choice><sic>repronded</sic><corr>responded</corr></choice> to the sentiment, "The State of Iowa," and Senator Ellison spoke of the "Impressions of a Visitor."  C. S.

                            <head type="sub">Commemorates the Great Service of General John C. Fremont&#8212;Correspondent with Mrs. Fremont.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The Postoffice department having decided to adopt the incident of the first planting of the American flag on the summit of the Rocky mountains by General John C. Fremont, "The Pathfinder," in 1842, as the subject for one of the special issue of postage stamps to by issued in commemoration of the Transmississippi and International Exposition, Third Assistant Postmaster General John A. Merritt, having this matter in charge, wrote to Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion, at whose suggestion this decision was made, and asked him to submit a sketch, or materials for making one, which should show with historical correctness the stirring event which marks an epoch in the history of the great west.</p>
                            <p>In reply to this request Mr. Rosewater sent to the Postoffice department a sketch based on historical date in his possession and at the same time he addressed a telegram to Mrs. Jessie Benton Fremont, widow of the great explorer, now living in Los Angeles, Cal., and asked her to send him a sketch of this great feat of her famous husband.  In reply to this Mr. Rosewater received an autograph letter from Mrs. Fremont, of which the following is a copy:</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3 type="letter">
                            <p>LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25.&#8212;My Dear Mr. Rosewater: I have just received your telegram.  First let me say how pleased and honored I feel by this recognition of General Fremont's great and long service in the expansion of the west.  From 1837, when he surveyed up to the sources of the Mississippi, until his last overland exploration (at private cost) in 1854, this was his one governing motive and occupation, and, as you know, it was my father's great wish&#8212;so that having grown into it with all my head and heart, I feel it a dear personal honor, and it is the first government honor ever given him for this service.</p>
                            <p>Photography, even daguerreotyping, dates after 1842, when that flag was first planted in the Rocky mountains.  The merest crude sketch of the mountains was made by Previs, the topographer.  In 1853 Humboldt, in his Cosmos, volume I, preface, says: "At last we shall get the truth in nature, for this new art (Daguerreo's) will be used by future explorers."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Fremont was the first to so to use it, in 1853-4, on his last exploration, undertaking, at his own expense, to prove the possibility of the winter travel over what is now pretty much the line of the Santa Fe after it leaves the plains.  This was twelve years after the raising of the flag on the peak in what is now Wyoming.  You see how entirely impossible it is for me to do what you wish.  Leutze's fresco on the landing of the stairway to the United States house of representatives in Washington is a medley of absurdities&#8212;nursing mothers and babies closely grouped among old men and young, and domestic animals also around the flagstaff.  It will require an artist of severe simplicity to reduce this sketch to a stamp.  I send you all I think may help, with brief notes for an artist.  I have here the precious  flag, of which I send you a photograph.  Sincerely yours,</p>
                            <signed>JESSIE BENTON FREMONT.</signed>

                            <div3>
                            <p>Enclosed in the letter was a colored print of an American flag.  Of this a memorandum in the handwriting of Mrs. Fremont said: "I send (cut from my own copy of Fremont's memoirs) the illustration of the Rocky mountain peaks, and the flag.  The flag is a photograph from the true flag, now in my possession.  You will see it belongs to a past time, when the Indians had to be talked to in symbols&#8212;the pipe of peace, or the claw full of arrows, were both there for them to choose.  Even the Blackfeet are tamed down now to our flag, meaning both."</p>
                            <p>There was also enclosed an engraving made from a daguerreotype taken in 1850 and a tintype made in 1873 at Bar Harbor, Me.  Mrs. Fremont wrote that by combining these two a portrait true to life might be secured.</p>
                            <p>These portraits represent the general as he is remembered by those who saw him in Omaha several years ago.  He and his estimable wife visited with the late Judge Savage at his home in the city about twelve or fourteen years ago, and later, in 1888, the general accompanied the Nebraska delegation to the national republican convention in Chicago which nominated Harrison for the presidency.  On this occasion the old soldier was a conspicuous figure, his spare, lithe figure and active movements showing little trace of the nearly fourscore years which had whitened his head.</p>
                            <p>It is not known just what denomination of stamp will be chosen for the picture of this event in the life of the Pathfinder, but the general sentiment among those who have given the matter thought is that one of the denominations most frequently used should be selected for this purpose.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Governor Jones Appoints More Men to Look After State's Interests.</head>
                            <p>Governor Daniel W. Jones of Arkansas has decided that the Importance of the Transmississippi Exposition to his state is such as to warrant the most energetic steps to provide for its proper representation at Omaha.  He has accordingly enlarged the state commission appointed a few days ago by naming thirty-three additional commissioners, making the total number thirty-nine, with Colonel Vincenheller as chairman of the board.  A letter from the governor to the members of the commission is:</p>
                            <p>LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Jan. 26.&#8212;Dear Sir: Notwithstanding the fact that the legislature failed to provide for an Arkansas exhibit at the Transmississippi Exposition at Omaha, Nebraska, next year, yet, in view of the importance of an exhibit as a means of attracting the emigration of the northwest which has been and is now seeking milder climate, and for other purposes, it has been decided to procure a representation there by other means.  To this end a board of commissioners is necessary, and I have been requested by the exposition managers to announce that board.</p>
                            <p>Colonel W. G. Vincenheller is vice president of the exposition and will naturally be chairman of the board and each commissioner will be expected to render all the aid possible in securing exhibits from his to attend the exposition at such time as may be agreed upon.  I am assured that the transportation of the exhibits can be obtained, but it will require some effort on the part of the commissioners to secure and collect them, though a great deal can be done from Colonel Vincenheller's collection already on hand here.</p>
                            <p>On January 17 I announced the following named gentlemen as members of the Board of Commissioners for Arkansas at said exposition, to-wit: George R. Brown, Little Rock; A. Bertig, Paraould; C. G. Newman, Pine Bluff; L. A. Byrne, Texarkana; W. D. Matthews, Stuttgart; George Sengel, Fort Smith.</p>
                            <p>In view of the fact that there are no funds to pay the expenses of collecting the exhibits it has been decided that a more numerous commission, consisting of a member from each section of the state, could do the work more effectively, and with that idea I have selected the following named gentlemen, and they are hereby appointed, as members of said commission, to-wit: W. P. Fletcher, Lonoke; S. C. Dowell, Walnut Ridge; H. L. Cross, Bentonville; J. F. Walker, E. M. Funk, Rogers; F. P. Hall, Prairie Grove; R. H. James, Mena; J. C. Irby, Newport; A. W. Pool, Ozark; E. T. McConnell, Clarksville; L. P. Berry, Marion; J. B. Butts, Helena; Emmett Rogers, Jonesboro; A. S. Layton, Yellville; R. B. Weaver, Rally Hill; H. H. Gallup, Buffalo; W. T. Hopper, Mountain Home; D. S. Helvern, Mammoth Spring; J. R. Newman, Harrison; Steve Carrington, Hope; Eugene Barkman, Arkadelphia; W. M. Price, Stuttgart; X. O. Pindall, Arkansas City; Rev. J. M. Lucey, H. G. Hanna, Pine Bluff; Thomas Matthews, Monticello; J. R. B. Moore, Heber; L. H. Owens, DeVallis Bluff; J. C. Yancey, Batesville; J. T. Pomeroy, Eureka Springs; w. B. Folsom, Brinkley; J. R. Harris, Springdale; A. C. Hull, Little Rock.</p>
                            <p>I earnestly hope that you will accept this appointment and that you will be able to devote some time and attention to the work, as it is not a mere matter of form, but of real importance to the state.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Vincenheller, as chairman of the board, has decided to call a meeting in this city on February 3 for the purpose of organization and determining plans for the work, and it is very much desired that you should be present at that meeting.  If, however, you find it impossible you are requested to correspond with Colonel Vincenheller about the work to be done.  Yours very truly,</p>

                            <head type="sub">Governor Steunenberg Chooses the Men to Arrange the Exhibit.</head>
                            <p>Idaho is one of the last of the transmississippi states to make arrangements for representation at the exposition.  The legislature made no appropriation for this purpose and the matter has lain dormant, little or nothing having been done to arouse the people of the state to action.  Governor Steunenberg has taken the matter in hand and has appointed a commission of representative men from all sections of the state to devise ways and means for making a state exhibit.  This commission is as follows: Montie B. Gwinn, Caldwell; R. E. Green, Boise; James Hutchinson, Silver City; Edward Richards, Hailey; George Chapin, Idaho Falls; P. H. Murname, Montpelier; J. P. Clough, Salmon; A. B. Campbell, Wallace; B. F. Morris, Lewiston; Joseph Vincent, Kendrick.</p>
                            <p>In order to avoid the expense of bringing the commissioners together from the remote parts of the state, the governor has divided the state into districts and those commissioners living in the north part of the state will look after their section, while those in the southern portion will do likewise, both working under a general plan to be hereafter agreed upon.  In his letter of notification to members of the commissioner the governor says:</p>
                            <p>To this great exposition during its five months of continuance will come hundreds of thousands of people to learn about the transmississippi and intermountain region.  The possibilities thus afforded for advertising the resources of our state by having there a suitable exhibition of its products should not, in my opinion, be overlooked.  We certainly cannot afford to be the only western state unrepresented at this great exposition.</p>
                            <p>Our legislature has made no appropriation for this purpose and it is consequently necessary that ways and means be devised to make possible a creditable showing.</p>
                            <p>The result of my inquiries about the matter has convinced me that the magnitude of the coming exposition at Omaha has bot been exaggerated and that the importance of having our state properly represented can hardly be overestimated.  We want people and capital and to get them must advertise our resources.</p>

                            <p>The Denver Exposition commission held a meeting in that city Friday night, at which plans for a city exhibit were considered.  Of this meeting the Denver Republican says:</p>
                            <p>The plans of the Denver committee include the erection of a building in the shape of a Maltese cross, the four extremities being rooms, one to be devoted to Denver manufactures and schools, a second to the horticultural and agricultural products produced in this vicinity and handled in the city, a third to be a reception room for the use of Colorado people attending the exposition and the fourth to be devoted to mines and mineral exhibits; the center to be surmounted by a dome with large pictures of prominent Denver buildings, including the capitol, Equitable, Ernest &amp; Cranmer, Denver club, etc., from the floor to about six feet in height.</p>
                            <p>Above these is to be a panoramic view of the city of Denver in colors, completely around the dome for about six feet.  Above this views of famous mountain scenery located on the Denver railroads.  These pictures to be transparent, with lights back of them to throw them into relief.</p>
                            <p>The plans also contemplate the removal of the building and exhibits to City park, Denver, at the close of the exposition, where it can become a permanent feature and attraction to the park.</p>
                            <p>The expense of this exhibit will approximate $5,000 and the committee has received very favorable responses which indicate that there will be comparatively little difficulty in securing this amount.  The exposition authorities have agreed to assign suitable and prominent space among the state buildings at the exposition for the Denver building.</p>
                            <p>Manager Bruce of the Department of Exhibits writes W. S. Ward, chairman of the Denver committee, that they are pleased to be able to make an exception in favor of Denver and enable them to erect the only city building that will be at the exposition and to assist the committee materially in that direction.  The Denver committee has sent for ground plans of the exposition and at a meeting to be held next Saturday will decide on the location of the building.  Jackson, the photographer, has agreed to furnish the panoramic view of Denver to be used as a Frieze to the dome at a comparatively normal cost.  The Denver railroads will furnish the scenic views desired and considerable enthusiasm has developed on the part of those interested in the successful carrying out of the contemplated plans.</p>

                            <p>The Georgia Exposition commission held a meeting in Macon Wednesday of last week with the mayor, members of the city council and many of the most prominent citizens of Macon to consider the matter of a Georgia exhibit at the exposition.  Mayor Price, on behalf of the people of Macon, assured the commission that that city will do its full share in assisting the commission and in promoting the interests of the state.  Representatives of the railroads made similar promises and the members of the commission expressed themselves as greatly encouraged with the expressions of co-operation and assistance.  The commission will meet with the people of Augusta February 2, and subsequent meetings will be held in the cities of Savannah, Brunswick, Columbus and other cities in the state.  The project for a Georgia pine palace is growing in favor and it is practically settled that the Georgia state building will take this form, being constructed of Georgia pine throughout, all in "hard oil" finish and polished to the highest degree.  The people of that section are most enthusiastic in this matter and promise that their pine palace shall compare most favorably with any state building on the ground.</p>

                            <p>The St. Louis Globe-Democrat of Saturday contains an interview with Chairman Clark H. Sampson of the Missouri Exposition commission regarding the progress which is being made by the commission.  Among other things Mr. Sampson said: "Our people in St. Louis are actively at work, and already we have forty manufacturing exhibits secured.  Great interest is being manifested and we are now satisfied that a thorough canvass, upon which we will enter at once, will be productive of good results financially.  What is true of St. Louis also applies to Kansas City, St. Joseph and all parts of the state wherever any work is being done on behalf of our undertaking.  Our subcommittees are all in charge of live, practical, pushing men, who are determined to make a success of the respective tasks assigned them."</p>
                            <p>President Sampson has instructed Secretary Carroll to call a meeting of the full Missouri commission at Kansas City with the Commercial club February 15, and at St. Joseph on the following day.</p>

                            <head type="sub">MOBILIZATION OF IOWA NATIONAL GUARD</head>
                            <head type="sub">Secretary Judson Addresses Letters to the Officers, Pointing Out the Great Advantages of the Local Summer Plain.</head>
                            <p>Secretary Judson of the Council Bluffs exposition executive committee yesterday put into the mails 400 copies of a letter which he was instructed by the association to write to all of the commissioned officers of the Iowa National Guard, urging them to make every effort to secure the mobilization of the guard here next summer.  The letter is intended to supplement similar efforts that have been made by the association.  While the members of the legislature were here on Saturday the local committee took advantage of the opportunity to urge upon the members of the military and appropriation committees the importance of the plan and the necessity for including in the general appropriation bill the same amount required to defray the extra expenses of the encampment.  All of the legislators talked with expressed themselves as favorable to the encampment, and announced their willingness to advocate a reasonable appropriation.  Concerning the location of the encampment the letter says:</p>
                            <p>This association has secured the use of about 1,200 acres of ground lying within the corporate limits of the city of Council Bluffs and along the bank of the Missouri river.  It is clear, high and mostly level land, most admirably adapted for military evolutions, and a portion of the bluff front is included, thus giving a fine location for artillery and signal corps operations.  An officer of General Coppinger's staff, detailed to survey the ground, reported to the War department that the tract is most admirably adapted to military occupation.</p>
                            <p>The land lies in the shape of an irregular triangle, the south face being about three and one-half miles long, extending from the Missouri river on the west to the line of the bluffs on the east; the east face running along the line of the bluffs about one and one-half miles north to Big lake, and the other face running in an irregular line along the bank of the Missouri river, which is here comparatively high, to the western point.</p>
                            <p>This ground borders on the most settled portion of the city, lies seven blocks north of Broadway, the main thoroughfare between Council Bluffs and Omaha and directly on the line of the steam and electric railways which will connect this city with the grounds of the Transmississippi and International Exposition.  The grounds embrace all the topographical features conducive to a complete line of instruction, viz.: flat, hilly and rolling surface, a railway embankment bisecting the territory, an ideal river for military operations, a wagon bridge and a small lake.  Nothing in division, brigade or regimental instruction will be found impracticable from lack of suitable ground.  Ample water supply is at hand.</p>
                            <p>It is intended that this gathering of the Iowa National Guard shall be one of work and instruction, and to that end every opportunity will be given for field evolutions on a large scale, and especial care will be taken to accommodate every branch of the service.</p>
                            <p>A large representation from the regular army of the United States will be camped close at hand and it is expected that every branch of the service will be included, thus giving the militiamen an opportunity to gain much valuable knowledge through co-operation with the cavalry, artillery, engineering and signal corps.</p>
                            <p>It is not intended that this shall be a camp of parade, but a practical working school of regular instruction.  It is probable that the exposition authorities will desire the attendance of the National Guard on one or two occasions, and should the adjutant general deem it proper there will no doubt be a willingness to unite with the regular army and the National Guard of Nebraska at such times.</p>
                            <p>This camp will attract to this city large numbers of officers if not entire companies of the militia of other states, and it will be a grand opportunity for Iowa to exhibit the efficiency and magnificent condition of its National Guard.</p>
                            <p>It is proposed that the guard shall camp exactly as at division, brigade or regimental encampments, provide its own mess and maintain its own organization, the city of Council Bluffs assisting only where the adjutant general or his representatives shall desire.  The grounds will be put in condition and ready for occupancy and no engineering will be required on the part of the guard to prepare the camp grounds for the opening of the campaign.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Committee of Kickers on the Special Stamps Visits the Department.</head>
                            <p>A correspondent of one of the numerous philatelic journals which opposed the issuance of a series of special postage stamps commemorative of the exposition contributes an article to his paper, giving the result of interviews with Postmaster General Gary and Third Assistant Postmaster General Merritt before the former had taken final action and issued the order for the making of the stamps.  The correspondent was one of a committee appointed to register a vigorous protest with the authorities of the Postoffice department against the proposed issue, and especially against the proposed $1 and $2 denominations.</p>
                            <p>The correspondent records that "it seemed difficult to make any kind of an impression upon Mr. Merritt," who "expressed the opinion that there was sufficient demand for the higher denominations to justify their issue and rather than see them displaced by the 3-cent and 6-cent denominations, as suggested by the committee, he would add the latter to the set."  The committeemen then called on the head of the department, Mr. Gary.  The postmaster general is quoted as saying to the committee: "I found I had the power to authorize this issue and did it because I wanted to help the people in the west.  The Transmississippi Exposition means a great deal to the people of that section of our country, and its character is decidedly an international one, no less than fifteen foreign nations having promised their support.  While I am pleased to hear the opinion of any American citizen in regard to this issue, I do not consider philatelists greater patriots on account of the interest they take in the stamps of their country.  No one is compelled to buy the high values unless he wishes to do so."</p>
                            <p>The correspondent records that the committee then suggested to the postmaster general that numerous foreign governments of small caliber have resorted to special stamp issues to replenish a depleted exchequer, and hinted that this great government might be lowered to the level of these countries if the headlong course of the department was persisted in.  Mr. Gary gently informed the committee that he should do nothing which would lower the dignity of the American nation, and the interview was at an end.</p>

Mr. Hardt has found time, among the multiplicity of duties devolving upon him, to make a list of applications which have been filed by manufacturers who desired to install live exhibits of various kinds.  The list is a lengthy one, including the following entries: Four <choice><sic>arces</sic><corr>acres</corr></choice> of land for model irrigation farms in full operation; fifty Chinese artisans making articles in ivory, painting and doing other work peculiar to their country; potters and workers in plaster of paris will make their wares on the grounds; button making machinery will be in full operation; the manufacture of maple sap into syrup and candy will be shown; gasoline laundry machinery will be shown in actual operation; an electric plow in operation will be shown alongside an ancient wooden plow drawn by a cooley; the preservation of vegetables and fruits by a sterilizing process will be shown; the merits of numerous brands of yeast will be shown in operation at different stages, including the distribution of the baked rolls; incubators, not only for chickens, but for babies, will be shown in practical operation; machines for the manufacture of acetyline gas will be in evidence; lapidarists, glass, wood and metal engravers will install plants and turn out novelties; machines for making barb wire, nails and wire fence will be shown; a boot making plant will be shown in the shoe and leather section.</p>

                            <p>The Denver Times in a recent issue commends the action of the people in the Arkansas valley of Colorado, who have gone energetically to work to prepare an exhibit of the resources of their section, regardless of the result which may attend the efforts of the Colorado exposition commission to provide ways and means for a state exhibit at the exposition.  Among other complimentary things the Times says:</p>
                            <p>The Arkansas valley is one of the richest of the many rich garden spots of Colorado and already has made a name and a fame for itself throughout the length and breadth of the land.  Its luscious watermelons and its delicious cantaloupes are known and appreciated from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and yet the general public has little or no idea of its real worth and productiveness.  It is the prevailing impression that melons and jackrabbits are the only products of the valley worth mentioning.  With a determination of dispelling this illusion the people of the Arkansas will exhibit at Omaha such an array of facts regarding their interests as shall compel the truth to be accepted.  Agricultural products such as can only be grown under Colorado irrigation will also be there, including wheat which for quality and yield cannot be excelled in any part of the country.  There will likewise be fruits of finest flavor and texture, and many other things to delight the hearts of those who appreciate the bounties of nature, which have been so liberally bestowed upon this beautiful valley.</p>

Without exception, those interviewed urge the city and state commission to renewed efforts in seeing that the limitless resources of Missouri are well represented.  It is stated that the efforts of the St. Louis and Missouri commissions have aroused much interest on the part of all public-spirited citizens, especially the industrial and commercial people.  Some of those interviewed were with the Missouri delegation which visited Omaha last month and they are most emphatic in the statement that no one who has not been to Omaha and seen for themselves the progress that has been made and the grand scale on which the preparations are being made can appreciate the importance of the exposition to Missouri.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Government to Make an Exhibit of the Great Work of This Important Branch of Its Functions.</head>
                            <p>Lieutenant C. H. McLellan, an officer of the United States Life Saving service, is in the city to arrange the details regarding the exhibit to be made by that department of the government at the exposition.  An appropriation of $2,500 is available for that purpose and Lieutenant McLellan has been sent to Omaha to view the situation and decide upon the adaptability of the exposition grounds for a display such as is desired by the department.</p>
                            <p>This officer has had extensive experience in this line of work, having been in charge of the exhibits made by the department at the Philadelphia Centennial, the expositions at London and Paris and at Chicago and Atlanta.  He stated to the exposition officials that it is the desire of the service to install a complete station of the life saving service and equip it with a full crew of men and all the latest life saving devices in use in the actual work of the department.</p>
                            <p>Provision has been made by the architects of the exposition for the installation of such an exhibit at one side of the broad pool forming the west end of the lagoon, known as the Mirror.  This pool is about 400 feet in width at this point and has sufficient depth to allow the boats used in the service to be manipulated without difficulty.  A spot has been left at the south side of the pool and a similar spot directly opposite at the north side, in either of which the life saving station may be erected.  A roadway to the water's edge could easily be provided, passing from the station through the colonnade without interfering with the use of the covered passageway.</p>
                            <p>Lieutenant McLellan spent the morning in consultation with the exposition officials and the architects and made a visit to the exposition grounds to inspect the locations pointed out by the architects.  If either of these prove satisfactory he will make the necessary report to the department and provisions for erecting the small building required for the station will be made at once.  The building will be of the style approved by the department for sea coast life-saving stations and will require but a short time for its erection.</p>
                            
                            <pb n="219" xml:id="TMISB03-219"/>
                            
                            <p>"The object of the department," said Lieutenant McLellan to a Bee representative, "is to make the exhibit as realistic as possible, so as to show the people who are remote from the seacoast just what the department is doing in the way of saving the lives of people on vessels which may be wrecked along our coasts.  The people of the west help contribute money which supports the department and its officers take the view that they are entitled to know how it is being used.  For this purpose there will be installed at Omaha a complete station of the service and the full operation will be shown.  To do this effectively a provision will be made to simulate a wreck&#8212;a mast will be erected in the water to represent the exposed portion of a wrecked ship and a line will be fired over this from the small cannon used by the service for that purpose.  This will serve to haul out a heavy line, to which will be attached the breeches buoy, the life car and numerous other devices with which hundreds of human lives are saved by our men every year.  There will be many other features about this display which will be of great interest to the people who have never lived along the coast and, consequently, never have had an opportunity of seeing the work of the service.  There are many different methods for rescuing people from shipwrecked vessels and these will be sufficient to make exhibitions which will not grow monotonous.  I shall probably be in charge of the display at your exposition, as I have been detailed for that duty at every display made by the department, and I can assure the people of the west that the exhibit of the live saving service will not be the least interesting of the many things the government will exhibit."</p>

                            <p>Although the conference between the water committee of the exposition association and members of the various commercial bodies of the city was prolonged last night until 11:30 o'clock, no solution of the problem to provide water for the grounds was reached.  Those who met with the committees as members of business organizations were President James E. Boyd, Captain Palmer and S. H. McWhorter, of the Board of Trade; W. G. Shriver, C. C. George and Alonzo P. Tukey of the Real Estate Exchange; President George F. Munro, A. D. Morse and Ovando Cowles of the Business Men's association; Attorney W. S. Poppleton, W. D. McHugh and John Steele of the Commercial club.  The Central Labor union had been requested to send a committee to the conference, but no members of that organization put in an appearance.  City Attorney J. Connell and Councilman Ernest Stuht were present ,as were also Attorneys J. M. Woolworth and R. S. Hall and General Manager E. L. Bierbower and Superintendent A. B. Hunt, representing the water works company.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Freeman P. Kirkendall of the water committee was in attendance ,but at his request Attorney C. S. Montgomery presided over the conference, during which every conceivable phase of the controversy with the water works company was exhaustively discussed.  The attorneys for the water works company insisted that this corporation could do nothing for the exposition as long as its hands were tied by court injunctions and Mr. Poppleton, attorney for one set of enjoiners, insisted that he could promise nothing in the shape of a compromise for his clients.  At times the debate grew heated and personalities were bandied freely between the opposition lawyers.  Councilman Stuht said that the city council had decided to leave the matter entirely alone and City Attorney Connell explained the legal complications involved, so far as the injunctions against the mayor and council were concerned.  E. Rosewater urged the necessity of prompt action, as did also every other person present.</p>

                            <p>On motion of Mr. Munro it was finally decided to take the work of attempting to effect a compromise between the water works company and the other parties to the injunction suits entirely out of the hands of the exposition directory.  It was the sense of the meeting that the executive committee of the Board of Trade, Real Estate Exchange, Business Men's association, Commercial club and Central Labor union should be requested to meet immediately and each appoint three members of its respective organization, none of whom shall be a director of the exposition, to get together as a committee and formulate such concession<unclear/> both the city and the water works company as they might hope would bring about a settlement of the question.  This committee is instructed to wait upon the company with its compromise and endeavor to bring it around to some understanding.  If the company should consent to a settlement on the plan the committee shall propose, then the latter will carry it proposition to the plaintiffs in the injunction suits for their approval.  In the opinion of a majority of those present at the conference this was about the only plan by which a speedy settlement of the controversy could be accomplished.</p>

                            <head type="sub">LINCOLN CONTRACTORS PAY THE SCALE</head>
                            <head type="sub">Kimball Bros. Accept the Dictum of the Nebraska Commission and Avert the Trouble that Threatened.</head>
                            <p>The threatened difficulty between the Nebraska Exposition commission and the labor organizations of Omaha over the wages being paid to plasterers on the Nebraska building on the exposition grounds has been adjusted in accordance with the terms of a resolution passed by the commission at its last session, which directed the staff contractors to pay the scale of wages adopted by the Omaha labor unions.</p>
                            <p>Before the construction of the Nebraska building was commenced the commission adopted a resolution declaring that the scale of wages adopted by the Omaha unions should be the guide in fixing the wages to be paid men employed on the Nebraska building.  The building was erected by day's labor, the scale being paid.  The staff and plaster work, however, was let to the Kimball Bros. of Lincoln, and soon after they commenced work it was charged that they were paying but 35 cents.  A committee representing the labor organizations agitated the matter and held sessions with the members of the commission and with Governor Holcomb, charging that the commission had broken faith with the labor element.  This resulted in the passage of a resolution of the commission as heretofore referred to.</p>
                            <p>Assistant Secretary Dearing notified the contractors of the action of the commission and the following reply from them closes the matter:</p>
                            <p>LINCOLN, Jan. 31.&#8212;Hon. W. H. Dearing, Secretary, Omaha:  Dear Sir&#8212;Your letter of the 27th inst. is received, insisting that we comply with the resolutions passed by the board at their last meeting, relative to paying the plasterers on the Nebraska building the Omaha union scale of wages.</p>
                            <p>Our men are apparently satisfied with the wages being paid, which are 35 cents per hour, and are each one under contract to finish the building at that rate, and we believe this is a fair and reasonable rate, considering the wages paid for other kinds of mechanical labor at the present time; however, we have no objection to tradesmen uniting in the proper way to dignify their respective professions and get as high wages for their work as possible, and we do not wish to stand in the way of the Omaha union in upholding their scale of wages, and for the further reason that the former resolutions, passed by the board upon the subject of wages, has been construed by the governor and also be members of the board, to be implied by our contract, which has been so strenuously insisted upon.</p>
                            <p>You may inform the board that we will comply with their request in this matter.  Yours truly,</p>

                            <head type="sub">Apply to County Commissioners for an Appropriation.</head>
                            <p>A delegation composed of G. W. Hervey, Henry Eicke, J. Y. Craig and William Turner, all members of the Douglas County Horticultural society, appeared before the county commissioners this morning and explained their views relative to Douglas county making a fruit and floral display at the exposition.  As spokesmen for the party, Mr. Harvey stated that it was the purpose of the society which he represented to collect all of the rare flowers grown in the county and with the aid of his assistants placed them in beds and pots about the grounds.  Fruit would be gathered and shown in the Horticultural building, the purpose being to collect the fruit frequently enough so that it would be fresh all of the time.</p>
                            <p>The members who accompanied Mr. Hervey said that they all expected to work without pay, but money would be required in collecting the flowers and fruits and that they might carry out their plans, they would be pleased to acquire a portion of the money accruing from the sale of the exposition bonds.</p>
                            <p>The county commissioners informed the members of the committee that the supreme court had not passed upon the legality of the bonds and that nothing could be done until it was known whether the county would have money to appropriate.  When the court passed upon the question, and if it was held that the bonds were legal, the commissioners said that they would consider the proposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Bluff Tract to Be Converted Into a Park to Be Filled with Blooming Flowers and Shrubs.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The floral decorations of the portion of the bluff tract of the exposition grounds below the grand plaza will be magnificent in the extreme and there is every indication that this portion of the grounds will be the most popular in the entire exposition, especially among the large majority of humanity which loves to look at beautiful flowers.  The foremost florists of the United States will be assigned this large tract of ground, where they will vie with one another in the effort to produce the most beautiful result, and the onlooker at this friendly contest will be enabled to feast his eyes on the marvelous beauties of nature in her happiest moods.</p>
                            <p>The lower half of the bluff tract is devoted to state and city buildings.  The only main exposition building so far located on this portion of the grounds is the Horticulture building.  There will be a number of state buildings on this tract, headquarters for the people from various states and cities, and this fact of itself will assure the popularity of this part of the grounds.  It has been the firm purpose of the exposition management from the very beginning to make this part of the grounds a park in which the sightseers might rest beneath the spreading trees and enjoy the beauties of nature.  The tract is a large one and the amount of open ground available for parking will be considerable, notwithstanding the number of buildings which will be on it.</p>
                            <p>In order that the floral features of this portion of the grounds might be made as attractive and striking as possible Prof. F. W. Taylor, superintendent of the Bureau of Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry of the Department of Exhibits, has been negotiating with the most prominent florists in the United States with a view to having them make outside displays of their specialties and adding to the beauty of the grounds while displaying to admiring thousands in the products of their art.  These negotiations have proved successful in an eminent degree, and a floral display is now assured which will equal in beauty anything in that line ever attempted in this section.  There will not only be a great variety of flowers which will flourish in this climate, but a special effort will be made by each florist to produce rare specimens of these varieties, and the result will be a collection of rare and beautiful flowers which will make this portion of the grounds a veritable garden of Eden.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">PRIDE OF THE FLORISTS.</head>
                            <p>One of the most striking spots in this section of the grounds will be the aquatic basin, which will be just north of the center of the Horticulture building.  This basin has already been excavated and is about 100 feet in diameter and about four feet deep in the center.  Henry A. Dreer of Philadelphia, one of the foremost growers of aquatic plants in the United States, has agreed to take full charge of this basin and fill it with his rarest and most beautiful specimens.  Mr. Dreer makes a specialty of growing the rarest varieties of these plants and those who have seen the beautiful basins in the public parks and large private grounds in eastern cities will realize the great treat in store for the people who visit the exposition, especially those who have never seen the entrancing beauty of these most remarkable plants and flowers.</p>
                            <p>The ground about the buildings on this tract will be laid out in flower beds of various shapes and sizes, and these will be taken in charge by the several florists who have agreed to fill them with their finest specimens.  That each florist will put forth every effort to distance the others in beauty and effectiveness of this display goes without saying.</p>
                            <p>There will be cannas galore.  The great popularity of this most effective bedding plant has reached a point within the last few years where fortunes have been spent in producing rare varieties and the visitors to the exposition will be afforded a treat in this line alone which will "be worth the price of admission."  The tendency among <unclear/>rs of this plan<unclear/> dwarf specimen <unclear/>

                            ing of the National Florists association at Providence, R. I., a perfect specimen of this rara avis.  Mr. Vaughan will have a number of beds of different varieties of flowers on the bluff tract, but it is probable that his canna beds will be one of the centers of attraction.  He has promised to show some of his finest specimens and the beds will contain varieties of this brilliant flower, ranging from one foot to twenty-four in height, with leaves of every shade from light green to dark bronze.  F. R. Pierson &amp; Co. of Tarrytown, N. Y., and the Lovett company of Little Silver, N. J., are also specialists in growing cannas and they will take part in showing the result of their efforts to produce rare and interesting specimens of this popular.</p>

                            <p>A. Blanc of Philadelphia is another canna specialist who proposes to dazzle the eyes and challenge the admiration of visitors by the gorgeous displays of this beautiful flower.  He writes that he will show 300 varieties of this plant and proposes to plant the bulbs in separate beds, putting each variety in a separate bed.  Mr. Blanc also wishes to make a showing of dahlias and will display over 1,000 varieties of this stately and popular flower which is a household word.</p>
                            <p>Another very beautiful flower in which wonderful changes have been made since the days when the grandmothers cultivated their flower gardens as a past time is the gladiola.  The well directed efforts of florists along scientific lines have made of this rather ordinary garden flower a thing of beauty and joy all summer.  The exquisite coloring and delicate beauty of the tall spikes of blooms thrown out by these plants are a never ending source of enjoyment to the lover of the beautiful and the outlook for the gratification of this sense on the bluff tract during the summer is very promising.  A number of beds of the hundreds of beautiful varieties of the gladiolus will be filled by Vaughan of Chicago and the Evans company of Euclid, O., both specialists in the growing of these flowers.</p>
                            <p>The sweet faced pansy will be in evidence on every side, and some of the rarest and most attractive varieties of this very popular flower will be installed in large beds by W. Atlee Burpee of Philadelphia and Vaughan of Chicago.</p>
                            <p>Rare varieties of roses will be among the beds supplied by Burpee of Philadelphia, and geraniums of special varieties, caladiums, coleus and innumerable other varieties of brilliant and attractive flowers will be planted at all available points, and will add a most pleasing feature to this portion of the grounds.  The Horticulture building will be filled with those rare and delicate flowers and plants which do not thrive under the fervent rays of the sun in the clear atmosphere of Nebraska, but the beautiful beds of many colored flowers about the grounds will make this portion of the exposition one of the most attractive of the many interesting points.</p>

                            <head type="sub">BUILDING FOR FOREIGN EXHIBITS.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Need for Such an Institution is Becoming Very Apparent.</head>
                            <p>The Department of Exhibits will soon begin clamoring for the erection of a building for foreign exhibits.  Applications for space for this class of exhibits have been coming in at a rapid rate within the last month and there is no space in which to install them.  Notwithstanding the recent change in the designation of the main buildings, which gave the manufactures exhibit an increase in space of about 25 per cent over what was available theretofore, the applications for space from all parts of the United States are pouring in at such a rapid rate that the available space in the Manufactures and Liberal Arts buildings will not be sufficient to accommodate them.  In addition to the applications already received, the department received notice today from its agent in Paris, Frederick Mayer, that at least 150 French firms will make exhibits of their wares and will want considerable space.  He also stated that the officials of the French government have under consideration the advisability of making a government exhibit at Omaha, and will pass upon it about February 15.  He says pressure has been brought to bear upon the officials, and he is hopeful that an exhibit will be made.</p>
                            <p>In this contingency the department is disposed to urge the erection of an additional building, in which the foreign exhibits may be placed.  It has been suggested that an annex might be made to the Manufactures building, extending north on Twentieth street from the west end of the Manufactures building.</p>

                            <p>Frederick J. Mills of Boise City, state engineer of Idaho, arrived in Omaha this morning to consult with the exposition management regarding the exhibit to be made by his state.  The Idaho Exposition commission was appointed by Governor Steunnenberg after Mr. Mills had left the state, but he is acting at the request of the governor and will report the result of his investigations for the information of the commission.</p>
                            <p>"Our people have taken very little interest in the exposition until within the last two weeks," said Mr. Mills.  "They are pretty well aroused now, however, and I believe we will have a good exhibit.  The legislature failed to make any appropriation, but we expect to raise about $15,000 by private subscription.  We will probably occupy about 5,000 feet of space, divided between the Agriculture, Horticulture and Mines buildings.  People not familiar with our state take it for granted that we are only a mining community, whereas horticulture is one of our principal industries.  The counties in the southwest part of the state grow fruit which will compare with that grown in any western state and we will have exhibits which will demonstrate that fact.  Our agricultural resources are also extensive and we shall make a creditable showing in that line, as well as in minerals."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Claims Exclusive Credit for Expediting Exposition Construction.</head>
                            <p>BOSTON, Jan. 24.&#8212;To the Editor of the Boston Transcript:  In your interesting letter from Omaha by Eleanor Dutcher on the Transmississippi Exposition, as usual, all credit for success was given contractors and builders and the various architects were not mentioned.  As an actual fact, the rapidity with which the work has been carried on is due to the constant work and skill of the men employed to design and carry out the entire scheme, the separate buildings.  I should like, if possible, to have these facts stated.  As we are architects-in-chief of the exposition such a statement necessarily contains a certain amount of self-praise, but our own work would have been much less effectual if it had not been for the hearty collaboration of the architects appointed.  The facts of the case are as follows:</p>
                            <p>No previous exposition has had less than two years for its conception and achievement, and this exposition is very considerably larger than was the Midwinter in California or those at Atlanta or Nashville.</p>
                            <p>We were appointed architects-in-chief March 15, 1897.  The exposition is to be completed and opened June 1, 1898.  In March the 180 acres or more upon which the exposition was to be installed was a grass-grown, slightly modulating piece of land upon the bluff north of the city of Omaha.  At the present date 100 acres if this land at least is graded, some ten miles of roads and paths laid out, a lagoon one-half a mile long, 100 feet wide at its narrowest point, 450 at its widest, excavated, surrounded by sheet piles, filled and now being used for a skating carnival.  Eight buildings, the smallest of which covers four times the superficial area of the Boston Public library, are being erected, and six of these building are approaching completion.  They are being connected with colonnades and peristyle courts, so that there will be over a mile on continuous buildings.  In addition to this there is a plaisance half a mile long&#8212;some forty acres (about the size of Boston common) devoted to the Horticultural building and exhibits and forming a park in which numerous state buildings are fast being erected.  There are also the various necessary smaller buildings, such as those for sanitary purposes, fire department, hospital, power houses, etc.  The development of the work was as follows:  Late in March the general arrangement of the exposition, location of buildings, etc., was made by the architect-in-chief, and the stripping and grading of land began.  In May the list of architects for the various buildings, submitted by the architects-in-chief, was approved, and these architects were provided with a general plan of the grounds and location of buildings, the heights and character of colonnades connecting the buildings, the general height of cornice and general style of architecture desired and a universal module or unit of scale for all the buildings, of sixteen feet.  The architects were given ten days to make sketches of their facades at a scale of one-sixteenth of an inch to the foot.  They then, at an appointed time, met at the office of the architects-in-chief at Omaha, and for two or three days these men, each of whom had a high reputation in his profession, worked with the enthusiasm of architectural students bent upon winning a grand prize, in developing and relatively adjusting to each other their various designs.  These designs were then exhibited to the executive board, approved, and each architect returned to his respective city to complete his designs.  In three weeks, that is, late in June, these drawings began to arrive at the office of the architects-in-chief, who at once began constructive drawings and specifications of each building when the designs were received.  The drawings required of each architect were plans, elevations and sections at scale of one-eighth inch to the foot, and drawings of most prominent portions at scale of three-fourths of an inch to the foot.  Late full-sized details of all mouldings and ornaments were to be sent as rapidly as they could be completed.  The architects-in-chief made all the construction drawings of each building, excepting the Government building.  On each building the number of construction sheets, each about three feet by five feet, varied from twenty-eight to thirty-six.  All the specifications varied.  Despite the immense amount of detail in the work, the last of the large buildings (excepting the Government building), was under contract early in October&#8212;that is, designs, working drawings, details and specifications of seven exposition buildings, the number of drawings approximating 250&#8212;were completed in four months and the buildings under contract&#8212;while during this period the architects-in-chief were designing all kiosks, bridges, viaducts, etc., upon these grounds.</p>
                            <p>The architects of the principal buildings were as follows:  Manufactures, S. S. Beman of Chicago; Machinery, Dwight Perkins of Chicago; Agriculture, Cass Gilbert of St. Paul; Fine Arts, Eames &amp; Young of St. Louis; Mines, J. J. Humphreys of Denver; Liberal Arts and Auditorium, Fisher &amp; Laurie of Omaha; Horticulture, Charles Beindorf of Omaha; Administration, entrance arch Children's building, all accessory buildings, general scheme and all bridges, colonnades, etc., color scheme and decorations, Walker &amp; Kimball, Boston and Omaha.</p>

                            <p>With this explanation of the development of the exposition, I think I am justified in saying that the architects should be mentioned, and that the mere fact that contractors with extremely complete and accurate plans and specifications assembled their materials in September, and by putting on large gangs of men completed some of these buildings in January, does not account for the expedition of the work or require much praise, as it was exactly what would be expected to be done under the circumstances, and I am somewhat tired of the praises of contractors and the silence in regard to architects.  I do not mean to deprecate the work of the contractors, but is employes' work well done, and should be rated as such.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Say They Will Have Nothing to Do with that Plan to Raise Money for Boys' and Girls' Building.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>The executive committee of the Woman's Board of Managers is up in arms and the members are preparing to resent what they assert is a gratuitous insult offered them by the exposition management by attempting to "inveigle" them into a scheme in connection with the photographs of the young women who are to form subjects for the composite picture to be reproduced on the souvenir medal of the exposition.  They say they have not been consulted in the matter and declare most positively that they will have nothing whatever to do with the scheme of exhibiting these pictures.</p>
                            <p>This whole difficulty grows out of the plan recently adopted by the executive committee of the exposition for securing a model for the woman's head which is to be placed on one side of the souvenir medal.  The matter was placed in the hands of Manager Lindsey of the Ways and Means department, and it was decided to secure a composite photograph which should be representative of the women of the transmississippi states.  In order to secure the material for this composite picture it was decided to ask the vice president of each of the transmississippi states to select the two handsomest young women in his state and send their photographs to Manager Lindsey.  In accordance with these instructions, each vice president published notices in the papers of his state calling upon all the beautiful young women to send in their pictures in order that the most beautiful might be selected.  Reports published in the papers in the states where these proceedings have been conducted indicate that the women have not been overly anxious to enter the contest, the number of pictures received by vice presidents being decidedly small.  Selections have been made, however, in some of the states and the pictures have been sent to Manager Lindsey.  Other states are still missing, but pictures from them are expected in due time.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">WHERE THE TROUBLE COMMENCED.</head>
                            <p>Up to the point the Woman's Board of Managers was not involved in the matter in any way and nothing was said openly about the affair, although it develops that the members of that body were not backward about expressing their opinions when called upon.  The trouble came when Manager Lindsey made the public announcement through the newspapers that he was securing the consent of the subjects of the photographs to the exhibition, for pay, by the Woman's Board of Managers, of these photographs, the proceeds to be turned into the fund for the Girls' and Boys' building.</p>
                            <p>Several conferences were held in the office of Secretary Ford, at which a majority of the executive committee was present and the matter was thoroughly discussed.  It was the unanimous opinion of the women that they would have nothing whatever to do with the project, and Secretary Ford was deputized to make known the decision of the members of the committee.</p>
                            <p>"You may announce through The Bee," said Mrs. Ford, "that the Woman's board will have nothing whatever to do with this picture business.  We have not been asked to take these photographs and exhibit them, and we object most decidedly to the announcement being made that we will do so.  We do not want them and will not exhibit them under any circumstances.  The women have come to the conclusion that this attempt to drag them into the affair is simply a scheme to add dignity to an undertaking which was doomed to be a fiasco when it was conceived.  The men seemed to think all that was necessary was to invite all the women who thought themselves beautiful to send in their photographs and the mails would be flooded with them.  The result proves that the women are not as great fools as the men seem to think, and now they are trying to drag the Woman's board into the affair in order to bolster it up.  The board declines to be put in any such attitude and will have nothing whatever to do with it.</p>
                            <p>"A woman may think she is good looking," continued Mrs. Ford in a spirited manner, "but we give her credit for having more sense than to want to parade that fact before the world at large, and the comparatively small number of photographs which have been received by the different vice presidents proves that our estimate is well founded."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Committee of Business Men Chosen to Look After California's Exhibit.</head>
                            <p>A preliminary meeting to devise ways and means for the proper representation of California at the Transmississippi Exposition was held at the rooms of the San Francisco Board of Trade the latter part of the last week.  Of this meeting the San Francisco Chronicle says:</p>
                            <p>Special committees were present from the Chamber of Commerce, State Board of Trade, Merchants' association, Manufacturers' and Producers' association, Mechanics' institute, San Francisco Board of Trade, California Miners' association and the Board of Management of the Mining fair.  A. G. McAusland, commissioner of the Omaha exposition; George W. Parsons, vice president of California, and Mayor Phelan were in attendance.</p>
                            <p>All in delegates spoke strongly in favor of having California properly represented at the exposition.  They were unanimous in the opinion that the exposition would be of the greatest benefit to California and that the opportunity should not be neglected to exhibit the vast resources of the state before the millions of visitors that will crowd the exposition from June until November.  It was decided to make a determined effort among business men, manufacturers and producers to obtain as large and extensive an exhibit as possible and to procure means to show California's products to the best advantage.  The following committee was appointed to represent the respective organizations: San Francisco Board of Trade, A. A. Watkins; Chamber of Commerce, Captain Charles Nelson; Merchants' association, F. W. Dohrmann; Manufacturers' and Producers' association, J. W. Kerr; California Miners' association, Jacob H. Neff; California State Board of Trade, N. P. Chipman; Board of Management of Mining Fair, E. A. Denicke; San Francisco County Miners' association, T. J. Parsons.</p>
                            <p>The next meeting of the committee will be held in the Board of Trade rooms on next Tuesday afternoon.  J. A. Filcher, manager of the State Board of Trade, and Edward H. Benjamin, manager of the Mining Fair, have been requested to attend the meeting.</p>

                            <p>Fire insurance men who visit the exposition with their families or friends will be entertained pleasantly during their sojourn at the great fair.  Steps looking to this end were taken at a meeting yesterday afternoon in the Ware block, which was attended by forty special agents of fire insurance companies, who reside in Nebraska.  They organized the Fire Underwriters' Transmississippi Exposition club of Omaha and decided to maintain headquarters in the city during the fair for the reception of visitors.  The officers of this organization as elected at this session are D. B. Welpton, president; W. E. Hitchcock, vice president and H. E. Benedict, secretary.  The club closed a lease with W. A. Paxton for rooms 520-21-22 in the Ware block for one year and they will be elaborately fitted up and handsomely furnished for headquarters, which will be distributed among the 1,200 members of the Northwestern Fire Insurance Underwriters' association, who will be requested to circulate it among the agents of their respective territory.  Visiting special agents who attended yesterday's meeting were N. S. Harding of Nebraska City, S. F. Alexander of Lincoln, Walter Atwater of Iowa City, Charles Martin of Kansas City, W. A. Tower and D. H. Andrews of St. Louis.</p>

                            <p>There will be a meeting of vast importance to the eight counties of southwestern Nebraska today at McCook, at which arrangements will be made for their representation in the state section of the Transmississippi Exposition.  The Board of Supervisors of each county will assemble in joint convention and consider the proposition for a composite exhibit of the agricultural and horticultural products of that section.  State Commissioner W. A. Poynter of the Third congressional district, Secretary W. H. Dearing of the Nebraska commission and Superintendent W. D.

                            <head type="sub">Buildings Too Far Advanced to Make Much Difference.</head>
                            <p>The high wind and low temperature made very disagreeable business of working on the exterior of the exposition buildings this morning and all the men so employed were laid off until the weather moderates somewhat.  The buildings are all in such an advanced stage, however, that this slight delay will not make any material difference.  The carpenter work on the Mines building, formerly the Manufactures building, is entirely completed and the building has been accepted by the exposition management.  The total amount of the carpenter contract was $27,175 and the exposition carries insurance on the building for 80 per cent of this amount.  A few finishing touches remain to be given the staff work when the weather moderates sufficiently to allow "pointing" to be done and then the building will be entirely completed.  The interior is entirely finished and ready for occupancy.</p>
                            <p>The Machinery building is nearly as far advanced at the Mines building and might be used for installing exhibits within the next ten days if that were necessary.</p>
                            <p>The staff is nearly all in place on the Manufactures building and rapid headway is being made.  The Agriculture building is in the hands of a large force of staff workers and plasterers and the staff ornamentation is strongly in evidence.  The Liberal Arts building is in about the same condition.</p>
                            <p>The Art building is making rapid progress and the carpenter work is in an advanced stage.  The center dome on the east section is entirely framed and is being covered.  The dome on the west section will be completed within a very few days.  The skylights are nearly completed and the roof covering will be put on very soon.</p>
                            <p>The staff men have started work on the Auditorium.  The carpenter work on this building was completed some time ago.</p>
                            <p>The Government building is progressing at a rapid rate.  The steel columns which will support the dome are all in position and the roof on the two wings is covered with sheathing.  The models for the staff work have not arrived, but notice has been received that a large number of the models have been shipped.</p>

                            <p>E. L. Danforth of Minneapolis, a member of the Minnesota Exposition commission, telegraphed to President Wattles this morning that a party of twenty business men from Minnesota will arrive in Omaha tomorrow morning at 9:10 o'clock over the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha railway.  They will be met at the Webster street depot by a reception committee comprising Dudley Smith, Euclid Martin, J. C. Wharton, Thomas Kilpatrick, C. B. Havens, A. C. Millard and H. S. Jaynes, and will be escorted to the exposition grounds and the exposition headquarters, returning to the Millard hotel about noon, where they will be entertained at lunch by the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>Reports from Minnesota indicate that great interest is being aroused in the exposition among the extensive manufacturing industries of that state and the commission recently appointed by the governor is meeting with encouragement in its effort to provide for a creditable state exhibit.  No definite arrangements have yet been made regarding a state building, but the party which will visit Omaha tomorrow comes to look over the grounds and learn the exact status of the exposition.  If they follow the footsteps of the preceding pilgrims a state building will be forthcoming.</p>

There will be spaces for twenty babies in this design, each little head to occupy a niche by itself, surrounded by graceful scrolls.  The portraits will be half-tone cuts of the youngsters, with the name and town underneath each one.  A charge of $5 will be made for each of these portraits to cover the cost of the cut, the design and other incidentals.  At this figure the spaces are going like "hot cakes" and few remain to be disposed of.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>This is Minnesota day in Omaha.  The North Star state is represented by a delegation of twenty-nine representative business and professional men who have come to Omaha to visit the exposition grounds and learn for themselves and the benefit of the people of their state the exact status of exposition affairs and the magnitude of the preparations which are being made for the display of the resources and industries of the great west.</p>
                            <p>The party arrived on the regular train of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha railway, which reached the Webster street depot at 9:10 a. m.  Dudley Smith, Thomas Kilpatrick and Superintendent Pearse of the public schools met the party at the depot and escorted the members to the Millard hotel for breakfast.</p>
                            <p>The personnel of the delegation is as follows: Thomas L. Schurmeier, wholesale dealer in dry goods, St. Paul; W. D. Kirk, banker, St. Paul; W. J. Footner, general manager Northern Express company, St. Paul; H. Wilson, banker, Faribault; J. Newton Nind, publisher of several trade journals, Minneapolis; E. L. Danforth of Minneapolis.  All of the foregoing are members of the Minnesota Exposition commission.  In addition to these the following men were in the party: W. H. Merrick, general agent of Singer Sewing Machine company; Charles P. Noyes, wholesale dry goods; George F. Finch, wholesale dry goods; R. A. Kirk, wholesale hardware; E. H. Bailey, banker; Colonel W.

                            <p>After breakfast the committee appointed to escort the delegation to the exposition grounds met the visitors.  In this committee were Dudley Smith, Thomas Kilpatrick, Superintendent C. G. Pearse, C. M. Wilhelm, H. S. Jaynes, E. Rosewater, A. P. Tukey, A. C. Smith, W. W. Bingham, W. J. Broatch and H. J. MacColl of Lexington.  About half an hour was spent in getting acquainted and the lobby of the Millard presented an animated appearance as the members of the visiting delegation and the local committee exchanged greetings and the conversation became general.</p>
                            <p>E. L. Danforth of Minneapolis has general charge of the visiting delegation and acted in the capacity of general manager.  Although the Minnesota Exposition commission is not yet organized, it is settled that Mr. Danforth is to be the secretary of the commission and the details of the rip have naturally been left to him.  He was for several years the secretary of the Minneapolis Commercial club and was appointed a member of the commission by the governor on account of his wide acquaintance with the business and professional interests of the state.  Speaking of the work of the commission this morning, Mr. Danforth said the plan of operation had not been formulated definitely, but the members of the commission were agreed that such action shall be taken as will assure a creditable representation on the part of the state.</p>
                            <p>"The manufacturing industry of our state will be well represented by exhibits made by representative firms from all sections," said Mr. Danforth, "and provision will undoubtedly be made for the exhibition of all of our agricultural and kindred interests.  The principal duty of the state commission will, therefore, be to stimulate these interests to make these exhibits and to co-operate with the exposition management as far as possible in promoting the exposition among our people.  We will be obliged to depend upon private subscriptions entirely, as our legislature made no appropriation for the purpose, but I do not anticipate any difficulty on that score.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">OUTLINE FOR A BUILDING.</head>
                            <p>"Whether our state shall have a state building remains to be determined.  We have several propositions from some of our best architects to furnish plans for a buildings and superintend its construction without any cost to the commission, and I have already suggested the erection of a building which will be a display of our resources in building material; the lower portion of the building, for a distance of about twelve or fourteen feet from the ground, to be of stone from some of our quarries and the upper portion to be formed of logs from our forests.  Such a building could be made very handsome and attractive and could be erected at a very small cost, but, as I said before, nothing has been determined.  The members of our commission are here to seek information and after returning home something will undoubtedly be done at once to get the work started."</p>
                            <p>The members of the visiting delegation all admitted that the people of their state had taken little interest in the exposition until very recently, and had been disposed to ignore it.  Since the promotion department had sent its agents into the state to arouse an interest in the matter and the newspapers had discussed the project they said the people had commenced taking an interest in it and now realize that a golden opportunity will be forever lost unless prompt action is taken.</p>
                            <p>After everybody had become acquainted with every other body a special street car was boarded and a trip made to the exposition grounds.  The main court and the bluff tract were visited, and the Minnesota visitors, like those from every other section who have visited the grounds for the first time, were more than surprised at what they saw.  They freely admitted that the magnitude of the operations was a great surprise to them and the scale was more extensive than they had conceived.</p>
                            <p>The party returned to the Millard at noon, where they were entertained at luncheon by the executive committee.  The visitors will leave for home at 5:55 o'clock this evening.</p>

                            <p>There is much satisfaction in exposition quarters over the decision of the supreme court sustaining the validity of the $100,000 of bonds voted by the people of Douglas county for participation in the exposition by this county.  Manager Lindsey of the Ways and Means department said this would have no bearing upon the efforts that are being made to increase the subscription list.  "We need fully $200,000 more subscriptions," said Mr. Lindsey, "and we must have that amount.  This exposition is growing every day, and nothing we can do can stop it.  We are compelled to enlarge our buildings and provide for still other buildings than those already erected or contracted for.  It is useless for the people to talk about confining the affair&#8212;it is a gigantic undertaking and we are like the man who caught the bear by the tail&#8212;we have to go along with it.  The people of Omaha, do not seem to realize the magnitude of the whole affair, but they must see it and come to the assistance of the management.  This decision of the supreme court is a great help, to be sure, but it will not be nearly sufficient to carry out the plans which must be completed."</p>

                            <p>LINCOLN, Feb. 2.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Late this afternoon the supreme court handed down an opinion upholding the validity of the Douglas county exposition bonds.  It holds that the act authorizing the county to vote the bonds was a special act and that in the matter of the number of voted required to carry the bonds the special act governed over the general provision.  It also held that the voting of bonds for the purpose of aiding the exposition was constitutional, being for a public purpose; that the bonds in question were legally voted, and that the auditor is required to register them and certify as to their validity.</p>
                            <p>In the matter of the Douglas county funding bonds, the court has ordered a re-argument with directions specifically that the question will be argued as to whether the amendment made by the legislature in 1883 to section 134, article 1, chapter xviii, of the Compiled Statutes, was germane to the original section.  This amendment related to the number of votes required to adopt a proposition to fund a county's indebtedness.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Governor Jones Appoints a Board of Forty Commissioners, Who Will Visit Omaha and Arrange for Exhibit.</head>
                            <p>LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Feb. 3.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;Arkansas will be represented at the Omaha exposition.  That fact was settled today at a meeting of the board of commissioners appointed by Governor Jones.  The board consists of forty members, representing every section of the state and its varied interests.  The entire day was taken up with a consideration of the enterprise from every standpoint.  Hon. R. W. Richardson of Omaha, representing the management, was present and in an exhaustive manner explained the object and benefits of the great enterprise.</p>
                            <p>It was finally voted to make a strictly state showing, independent of corporations or individuals, providing suitable concessions are obtained, which were outlined by Commissioner Richardson.  In order to satisfy all, the board accepted the invitation and will visit Omaha in a body in the near future, probably about the 15th.  At this time suitable space will be selected and in all probability arrangements made for the erection of a state building.  Governor Jones and other state officials will accompany the commission to Omaha on its preliminary trip.</p>
                            <p>The Cotton Belt railway has arranged to make an independent exhibit, embracing the resources tributary to its line in Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana.  Mr. Lebaun, general passenger agent, attended the meeting today and pledged his cordial support and cooperation in every possible way.</p>
                            <p>The state has no appropriation to draw upon, but its enterprising citizens will make the most of this golden opportunity to show the world what Arkansas has in the way of agriculture, minerals, timber, fruit, etc.  Colonel W. G. Vincenheller, commissioner of mines and agriculture, was elected as permanent president and W. D. Mathews, editor of the Stuttgart Free Press, permanent secretary.  Committees on finance, executive, agriculture, mines, forestry, etc., were ordered appointed by the president.  A vice president will be selected from each county and an earnest canvass for funds and exhibits will be prosecuted.</p>

                            <p>The representatives of the Denver and Colorado Exposition commissions who arrived in the city last night visited the exposition grounds this morning in the company of a special committee appointed to escort them, and when they returned they had been duly enrolled in the great and growing throng which is singing the praises of Omaha for its grit and enterprise in conceiving and executing such a gigantic enterprise as the Transmississippi and International Exposition.</p>
                            <p>The Colorado ambassadors to Omaha are W. S. Ward, chairman of the Denver commission, and a member of the Colorado commission, and A. T. McDonald, deputy city auditor of Denver, and a member of the Denver commission.  They walked over the main court and through the main buildings in company with Dudley Smith and C. E. Llewellyn, and also viewed the bluff tract.  While examining the latter section of the grounds they picked out a location for the building which Denver proposes to erect, deciding that a site just west of the Horticulture building and slightly to the south of it would be a most desirable and sightly location for their building.</p>

They were both very emphatic in their praises of the beauty of the buildings and the magnitude of all the operations.  Mr. MacDonald expressed his sentiments in no uncertain terms and Mr. Ward fully agreed with him.</p>
                            <p>"I was simply astounded at the beauty of the buildings and at the magnificent plan on which the whole work is being carried out," said Mr. McDonald.  "The arrangement of the grounds makes it possible to secure the most beautiful results and I believe your exposition will be a perfect dream when it is completed.  I had no idea the thing was projected on such a gigantic scale.  I have felt considerable enthusiasm in the matter of an exhibit by our city and state, but I am free to confess that my ideas have been greatly enlarged since seeing the preparations that are being made.  There can be no question about Denver being represented, but I shall endeavor to convince our people that our preparations must be on a scale which shall be in keeping with the magnitude of your preparations."</p>

                            <p>A representative of Nevada is in the city in the person of Vice President H. B. Maxson of Reno, chairman of the Nevada Exposition commission.  Colonel Maxson arrived this morning for the purpose of conferring with the exposition management regarding additional space, which he says will be required by his state for its exhibit.</p>
                            <p>"We already have 500 feet in the Mining building," said Colonel Maxson, "which we will fill with an exhibit of our mineral resources, but we want the same amount of space in the Agriculture building for the exhibition of our products of the soil.  I have a carload of minerals which will be shipped here when the time comes and our people want to send a fine collection of agricultural products to show the world that Nevada produces something besides minerals.  Our mineral exhibit will include fine specimens of gold, silver, lead, cinnabar and antimony and it will make a fine showing.  What we want to do in addition to this is to show some of our wheat, which runs seventy-three pounds to the bushel, and all the other products which are grown in our state.</p>
                            <p>"Nevada grows everything required for the sustenance of man," said Colonel Maxson, proudly, "and we are not dependent upon the uncertainties of the weather.  We irrigate, and our crops are always assured.  We have all kinds of climates within our borders and can grow anything that is desired.  In the southern part of the state we raise figs and tropical fruits, and we propose to make a showing which shall be diversified enough to satisfy any kind of taste.  We have not a dollar of funds with which to make our exhibit, nevertheless, and I am here for the purpose of making the necessary arrangements."</p>
                            <p>Colonel Maxson met the executive committee at noon and concluded the desired arrangements for space for his state.</p>

                            <head type="sub">State Commission Arranging for a Comprehensive Exhibit.</head>
                            <p>The New Jersey Exposition commission is proving a most energetic body of pushers and the attention the exposition is receiving at the hands of the people of that state is a most promising indication of the showing which will be made when the exposition is opened.  The chairman of the commission is Colonel Robert Mitchell Floyd, a retired capitalist of Jersey City, who is spending his entire time and his private means in furthering the interests of the exposition among the people of his state.  He is receiving the most ardent support from the leading newspapers of New Jersey and the neighboring states and the reports coming from there indicate that the work the chairman is doing will be strongly in evidence when the gates of the exposition are opened.  The Philadelphia Press of last Sunday contains a long interview with Colonel Floyd  regarding the progress that is being made in New Jersey, from which the following is clipped:</p>
                            <p>"We hope to get the legislature to appropriate $20,000 for a New Jersey building and for other expenses incidental to the proper representation of the state," said Colonel Floyd.  "The idea is to have a building constructed on the sectional plan, so that after the close of the exposition the building may be taken to Sea Girt and used by the state during the encampment of the National guard.</p>
                            <p>"At the exposition the building would be the New Jersey headquarters, where exhibitors and visitors from New Jersey could meet and feel at home.  It is very important that we should have a state building at the exposition, for the Dakotas, Colorado and other states are growing enormously and will consume great quantities made in the east.</p>
                            <p>"More than a score of the largest manufacturing firms in the state have agreed to send splendid exhibits to Omaha and others are considering the matter, some of the Newark firms are <choice><sic>gettting</sic><corr>getting</corr></choice> exhibits ready now and others are writing about space and transportation.</p>
                            <p>"Manufacturers, agriculturists and educators in Elizabeth, New Brunswick, Jersey City, Rahway, Trenton and other places have been visited and the subject presented to them, with encouraging prospects of a large number of them becoming exhibitors."</p>

                            <p>The Washington correspondent of the New York Times makes the following suggestion in a letter devoted to a discussion of the special postage stamps to be issued by the government in commemoration of the exposition:</p>
                            <p>An army officer, who has just received from Spain some postal cards, carrying typical Spanish scenes in phototype, including prominent buildings, bull-fight pictures and others, suggests that if Omaha is to be advertised at government expense through the Postoffice department, a better plan than that of getting up a special set of stamps would be to provide special postal cards, with pictures of the exposition buildings and grounds, and perhaps some pictures of Omaha, except the hog-sticking establishments, and put them on the market.  They might find large use from Omaha, and also be demanded by those who desired to make collections of sets.  The cost of the postal cards need not be greatly increased, as processes for illustrating could be found that would be inexpensive, and the quantities needed would bring the cost per card to a fraction of a cent.</p>

                            <p>Ex-Governor Robert W. Furnas, president of the Nebraska Pioneer association, has made a suggestion to the Nebraska Exposition commission which may result in installing on the exposition grounds a relic of the early days in this state.  This is the old stone chimney of the first house erected on what is now Nebraska soil, being the chimney of the old Baptist mission erected in 1833.  Mr. Furnas neglects to state where the mission referred to was erected, but he writes that the chimney is still standing and could easily be taken down and removed to Omaha, where it could be reconstructed with the stones in their same relative positions and form a most interesting relic of the old days in the territory.</p>
                            <p>He has been asked to submit an estimate of the cost of this work and Commissioner Poynter, who is in the city, said he had no doubt the board would adopt the suggestion and erect the old chimney near the Nebraska building.</p>
                            <p>Another suggestion in the line of an historical exhibit will also be considered by the Nebraska commission at its next meeting and will undoubtedly be adopted.  This suggestion comes from the Nebraska Historical society, the officers of which propose to loan to the commission, for making an historical exhibit at the exposition, all the Nebraska relics belonging to the society and co-operate with the commission in inducing persons having interesting relics to loan them for the purpose of enlarging the exhibit.</p>

He says that the three Davenport societies, the largest being the Turngemeinde, with a membership of 500, have voted to come to Omaha instead of holding a bezirkfest in the state, and three societies outside of Davenport have voted the same way.  If the societies in Burlington and Des Moines take the same position there will be no question about the matter.</p>
                            <p>News received by the department from the Kansas turner societies is to the effect that all of the societies in the state will come to Omaha instead of holding a state turnfest.</p>

There will be 63,000 feet of lumber required, the value being estimated at about $2,000.  The committee anticipates no difficulty in securing this amount, and this leaves but about $5,000 of the amount required for the building and its maintenance.  The commission feels certain this amount can be raised without difficulty and that the state will be well represented.</p>

                            <p>Another name has been added to the list of states firmly convinced that the Transmississippi and International Exposition is a good thing.  Minnesota's delegation, which visited Omaha yesterday, returned home thoroughly convinced that the exposition is bound to be a great affair and that the state in which they live must be represented in a creditable manner at Omaha when the big gates open June 1 next.</p>

                            <p>There were twenty-nine men in the party, each one qualified to represent in the most most fitting manner the particular line of business with which he is connected.  The diversified industries of the North Star state were all represented and the party was one of the most representative delegations of business men which has visited Omaha.</p>
                            <p>After everybody had become acquainted with every other body a special street car was boarded and a trip made to the exposition grounds.  The main court and the bluff tract were visited, and the Minnesota visitors, like those from every other section who have visited the grounds for the first time, were more than surprised at what they saw.  They freely admitted that the magnitude of the operations was a great surprise to them and the scale was more extensive than they had conceived.</p>
                            <p>After walking around the main court and through the buildings the party returned to the Millard hotel, where the visitors were entertained at luncheon by the executive committee.</p>

                            <p>After the cigars were passed Chairman Lindsey of the executive committee introduced John L. Webster to officiate as toastmaster in the absence of President Wattles.  Mr. Webster made a brief talk in assuming the duties devolving upon him, explaining in a few words the scope and purpose of the exposition and dwelling especially upon the importance of the enterprise to the extensive industries of Minnesota.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Pratt of Minneapolis was the first one called upon by the toastmaster to speak about his impressions.  The mayor spoke very briefly, expressing great pleasure at being afforded the opportunity of visiting Omaha and seeing how far the exposition had progressed.  He said he was glad to see the great progress which has been made because the people of Minnesota are all interested in the exposition and while no appropriation was made for representation on the part of the state he said he felt warranted in saying that the state will be well <choice><sic>represened</sic><corr>represented</corr></choice>.</p>
                            <p>George F. Finch of St. Paul was called on as one of the largest merchants in the west.  Mr. Finch confessed to being completely dumbfounded at the sights which he had seen at the exposition grounds.  He said the progress which had been made and the grandeur and beauty of the buildings had been a very great surprise to him.  "No other city in the world, outside of Chicago, could have accomplished what you have done," exclaimed Mr. Finch in the most emphatic and earnest manner.  "The business people of St. Paul are with you and all of our business men will do anything they can to forward the enterprise.  I for one am with you with both hands and I promise you that I shall do all I can to influence others."</p>

                            <p>Manager Rosewater of the Department of Publicity and Promotion was called upon by the toastmaster to tell the visitors about the advertising that had been given the exposition and the present condition of the enterprise.  He told about his recent visit to Minneapolis to arouse interest among the representatives of the commercial interests and the delays which surrounded the commencement of work in that section.  Taking up the present conditions, Mr. Rosewater said that eighteen of the twenty states in the transmississippi region are now organized and working to secure state exhibits of their resources, and a number of states outside of this region are also interested and have state commissions appointed, which are making preparations for representation.  He called attention to the Illinois building, now being erected on the grounds, and said the Wisconsin building will be commenced very soon.  In states along the Atlantic seaboard as much interest is being manifested in the exposition as by the western states.</p>
                            <p>"New Jersey, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Maryland and West Virginia have commissions appointed and working," said Mr. Rosewater, "and preparations are almost ripe for the appointment of commissions in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Kentucky.  Work is being done in other states, and fully thirty-five states will be represented in the exposition when the gates are opened.  No other exposition in this country, except Chicago, has ever had more than eight states represented.  Very little space will remain in any of our buildings if space was allotted to those whose applications are now on file.  We will be compelled to erect additional buildings in order to accommodate the great number of exhibits which are sure to come to us.  This exposition has been more thoroughly advertised than the World's fair.  We have been granted the same privileges regarding the admission of foreign goods for exhibition and now have a bill pending in congress, which has passed one branch, providing for an Indian congress.  The special postage stamp, to be issued for the exposition, has filled more space in the newspapers than was given to the Atlanta and Nashville expositions.  But we haven't stopped on this side of the ocean.  We have had pamphlets regarding the exposition printed in Paris, in Brussels, in Stockholm and distributed all over those countries."</p>

                            <p>Mayor A. D. Keyes of Faribault expressed the conviction that the Minnesota commission may be relied on to see that the state is properly represented, notwithstanding the fact that the legislature made no appropriation.  He said one feature of the exposition had not been spoken of, its influence in extending a community of feeling between the people of the west.  He said the trip of the Minnesota party had already shortened the distance between Minneapolis and Omaha.  He dwelt briefly upon this point, and expressed the thanks of the visitors for the manner in which they had been entertained.</p>
                            <p>Prof. C. M. Jordan, superintendent of the Minneapolis schools, joined in the expression of surprise and gratification at what had been seen at the exposition grounds.  He said he couldn't speak for the Board of Education, but believed that a good showing of the work of the schools would be shown.</p>
                            <p>W. D. Kirk, a banker of St. Paul and member of the state commission, said the delegation had come to Omaha to learn what they were expected to do and then go home and do it.  Commissioner Schurmeier of St. Paul and H. Wilson of Faribault coincided with the brief, but pointed statement of Mr. Kirk.</p>
                            <p>Charles P. Noyes, president of the Chamber of Commerce of St. Paul, said the body over which he presides is ready and willing to co-operate with the state commission.  He said he was glad he came to see what had been done and expressed his surprise at the magnitude of the exposition and the progress which has been made with the buildings.</p>
                            <p>Thomas Kilpatrick, one of the members of the Board of Directors of the exposition, spoke briefly on the friendly relations between the people of different sections of the west.</p>
                            <p>W. M. Liggett, superintendent of the state experiment station, spoke very briefly to the effect that a way will surely be found by the state commission for making a state exhibit.</p>
                            <p>E. W. Randall, secretary of the State Fair association, said the preparations which were in evidence at the exposition grounds, were greatly beyond his expectations and he commended the exposition management for the enterprise which had been displayed.  He said that he believed the board of managers of the Fair association will render material assistance to the state commission.  The exhibits which were prepared for Chicago are in the custody of the Fair association and he believed they will be placed at the disposal of the commission and assistance will be rendered in many other ways.</p>
                            <p>Jens K. Grondahl, editor of the Red Wing Republican, said he was a member of the last legislature in Minnesota and was on the committee which had charge of the bill making an appropriation for the exposition.  He said if he had known as much about the plan and scope of the exposition as he had acquired by seeing the grounds, he would have voted for the bill instead of against it.  He expressed the belief that state representation can be secured without any difficulty.</p>
                            <p>The party returned home on the regular train on the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha road, which left the Webster street depot at 5:55 p. m.</p>

                            <p>Manager Lindsey says, concerning the position taken by the Woman's Board regarding the suggested exhibition of the photographs of young women whose composite photographs are to form the model for the woman's head on one side of the exposition souvenir medal: "No one is going to compel the women to exhibit these pictures unless they wish to do so.  I never imagined there would be any objection on their part to such a proceeding.  I spoke to some of the women and they seemed to favor the idea, but if they don't want to do it, that settles it.  I have received photographs of two young women in Missouri, two in Nevada and two in Montana.  Each of these have consented to having her picture exhibited, as suggested, and has also consented to having them published in one of the leading magazines.  I have no doubt the same consent will be given by all of the others who will be selected.</p>
                            <p>"Some of the vice presidents have delayed the matter very seriously by putting the date for making the selection too far ahead.  Some of them have fixed a date in March.  This is unfortunate, as those pictures should all be in my hands by the middle of this month, but I suppose there is no way to change matters now.</p>
                            <p>"As for the plan being a 'fiasco,' I have seen no indication of such an ending.  The pictures are coming in and those I have received are of very handsome young women."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Members of the Commissions Come to Arrange for Space.</head>
                            <p>W. S. Ward and A. T. MacDonald of Denver, Colo., arrived in Omaha last evening as the representatives of the Colorado and Denver Exposition commissions.  Mr. Ward is chairman of the Denver commission and a member of the state commission, while Mr. MacDonald is a member of the Denver commission.  They came to confer with the exposition authorities regarding space and other details for the exhibit which is to be made by Colorado and by Denver.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ward said that the exact plan of the Denver commission has not been fully determined.  It is desired to erect a city building and instal therein exhibits showing Denver's resources and its principal buildings, its educational facilities, etc.  Just what can be done in this direction, he said, depends somewhat on the conditions governing such matters in the exposition rules.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ward also said the reports which have been sent out from Denver about clashing of different interests in the state commission and between the state commission and the bodies which are working up exhibits in different parts of the state are without foundation.  He declares most emphatically that the state commission and these other bodies, including the Denver commission, are working in perfect harmony and to the one end of securing as full representation as possible of the industries and resources of the state.  He said two members of the state commission, Messrs. Bishop and Hooper, have tendered their resignations to the governor on account of a slight misunderstanding, but the governor has not accepted the resignations and will not do so.  Mr. Ward says there can be no question but that Colorado will be represented in a creditable manner.  He admits that the state commission has been sadly handicapped by lack of funds, but says this will not interfere with a fine exhibit, as the several sections of the state are now well organized and are working in harmony with the state commission and largely under its direction.</p>
                            <p>"The city of Denver and the state of Colorado will not be found among the missing when your Transmississippi and International Exposition opens on June 1," said A. T. MacDonald, one of the Denver commissioners, who is at the Millard.  "Mr. W. S. Ward and myself have been delegated by the city commission to come to Omaha to select a site for a Denver building.  There is every prospect that a very creditable structure will be erected if we are fortunate enough to be allotted a suitable location.  We have been most cordially received here and tomorrow with a committee will visit the exposition grounds and 'size up' the situation, so that we may return to Denver and give our people some idea of the magnitude of the undertaking you have in hand.  Mr. Ward, the chairman of our board, had charge of Colorado's mining exhibit at the World's fair and is one of our sterling citizens.  He does not know of such a word as fail and is almost as enthusiastic over the exposition as are the citizens of this very enterprising city.  You can depend upon it, Colorado will have something to make your visitors talk about."</p>

                            <head type="sub">Council Bluffs People Propose to Raise a Lot of Money.</head>
                            <p>The executive committee of the Transmississippi association discussed finance at the regular meeting in the Grand hotel in Council Bluffs last night.  A new departure was made in the procedure last night and the suggestion of organizing a series of groups of energetic solicitors was carried out.  President Graham appointed four groups of six members each to make a systematic canvass for subscriptions.  They will cover all of the business part of the city and they will go to work at once with the intention of being able to make a substantial report at the next meeting a week hence.  The group that will have Main and Pearl streets from Broadway to Sixth avenue is composed of E. H. Walters, A. C. Graham, Dr. J. M. Barstow, William Moore and Leonard Everett; on Broadway west from Main street, Dr. J. H. Cleaver, I. M. Treynor, Judge W. I. Smith, J. E. Hollenbeck, H. W. Binder and W. S. Baird; Broadway east from Main street, M. F. Rohrer, M. Wollman, O. Younkerman, J. A. Hereld, J. A. Patton and J. P. Hess; Main street below Sixth avenue, V. E. Bender, J. P. Greenshields, H. I. Forsyth, O. P. Wickham, A. S. Hazelton and Dr. Hanchett.</p>
                            <p>The necessity for raising immediately a large sum of money was discussed and the members of the special committee pledged themselves to do their uttermost to provide funds for the erection of the big tepee.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Judson read an editorial in the Des Moines Leader, one paragraph of which was heartily applauded.  "Iowa," it says, "is too large, too rich, too intelligent and too good looking to do anything small and shabby.  If her small state debt and the very urgent and considerable demands of her state institutions require an economy that forbids the luxury of participating in this show, all right!  But in that case let her quietly decide to stay at home and work in the kitchen, and then do so without whining or pouting&#8212;under no circumstances being inveigled into sneaking off down to Omaha at the eleventh hour and appearing among her festal sisters wearing a gingham apron and sunbonnet."</p>
                            <p>While the committee was in session the women who have undertaken the work of raising money for the fund for building the Boys' and Girls' building appeared and asked the co-operation of the association in the work.  Among the women were Mrs. Judge Reed, Mrs. Phelps, Mrs. Atkins, Mrs. Terwilliger, Mrs. McBride, Mrs. Beno, Mrs. Patterson and the patronesses who assisted in making the collections in the public schools a short time ago.  The plans of the women were stated and a committee was appointed to confer with them in the parlors of the hotel.  The committee found about thirty enthusiastic women assembled and an hour was passed in discussing the plans that were submitted.  It was finally decided to accept the offer of a local paper to use one issue for the purpose.  The date selected was Washington's birthday, when the women will be given full charge of the paper and will make all the money possible from the sale of papers and the special advertising.  They will begin the work of preparation at once and will select an editor and appoint a corps of reporters and business agents, who will do the work for the day.</p>

                            <p>A meeting of the Bureau of Public Comfort of the exposition set for last night was postponed until the next regular meeting night on account of a lack of sufficient members being present.  Secretary Dudley Smith stated that a large number of communications were coming in from the many hosts and boarding places of the city and in all of them the prices given for accommodations during the summer were very reasonable.  He stated that from present indications visitors to the city need feel no hesitancy in making arrangements for long sojourns as in no instance would exorbitant prices be charged.  The special committee of the executive board having in charge tickets and stamps held a long session for the consideration of designs presented by various eastern firms.</p>

                            <p>Assistant Secretary Dearing of the Nebraska Exposition commission has received a rough sketch showing the ground plan of the proposed exhibit to be made by the museum of the University of Nebraska at the exposition.  This shows the general character of the exhibits and the grouping.  It is proposed to occupy a rectangular space arrange to represent the interior of a large room, with an entrance arch opening on one of the main aisles.  Around the walls of this room will be arranged the forestry exhibit and in the center will be cases containing the other exhibits.  Among the latter will be a collection of soil from each county in Nebraska, a collection showing the various kinds of clays found in the state, another showing all of the varieties of building stone and the sections in which they are found.</p>
                            <p>The center of the room will be occupied by a very large collection of the gigantic fossils found only in Nebraska, the huge "devil's corkscrews," found in the alkali section of the northwestern part of the state.  A gigantic skeleton of some <choice><sic>antedeluvian</sic><corr>antediluvian</corr></choice> monster found in this same section is now being assembled at the museum and will form a part of the exhibit.  There are numerous other things which will have place in the exhibit, many of them having no particular relation to Nebraska.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dearing is quite enthusiastic over the display, which will be made by the museum.  He is familiar with the material owned by the university, and says the people of Nebraska will be as much surprised as residents of other states when they see the exhibit which will be made of the resources of the state.</p>

                            <p>"I venture to say there are few people in Nebraska," said the assistant secretary, "who know that this state is ahead of every other state in the union in the matter of planted trees.  The forestry exhibit which will be made by the museum will be one of the most extensive which can be made by any state.  It is being added to constantly, and I believe it will be an eye opener to people who have not kept pace with the progress which has been made in tree planting in Nebraska within the last twenty-five or thirty years.  The increase in the number of trees on <choice><sic>ous</sic><corr>our</corr></choice> prairies is simply phenomenal, and there are hundreds of acres of timber large enough for commercial purposes.</p>
                            <p>"Our clays and building stone are other things with which our people are not as familiar as they might be, and I believe the showing which will be made in those lines by the university will surprise our people.</p>
                            <p>"Nebraska people may not remember," continued Dr. Dearing, "that Cass county, Nebraska, was awarded the first prize at the Centennial exposition in Philadelphia for growing the largest apple ever produced.

                            <p>"By reason of our office being located in the Millard hotel," remarked the assistant secretary, as he warmed up to the subject, "I am constantly thrown in contact with traveling men from every section of the country.  They naturally come in here to make inquiry about the exposition and they express their views very freely.  As a result of information acquired in this way, I am prepared to say that the attendance at this exposition from the east is going to be simply tremendous.  These traveling men tell me of preparations which are even now being made by various commercial interests in all parts of the east to come to the exposition and remain for two or three weeks.  These people will come in large parties; some of them will come in special sleeping cars and will remain in them while here, but the large majority will come with the <unclear/> and <unclear/></p>
                            <p>"All this simply means that the town is going to be completely overrun with crowds of people and that the exposition is going to be a marvelous success.  There is more doubt right here in Omaha regarding <choice><sic>teh</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> exposition and more belittling the enterprise than in any other part of the country.

                            <head type="sub">MARQUETTE ON THE STAMPS.</head>
                            <head type="sub">Postoffice Department Will Illustrate an Incident in His Life.</head>
                            <p>One of the designs which has been decided on by the Postoffice department for one of the exposition postage stamps is that of Marquette discovering the Mississippi river, but some little difficulty has been encountered in finding a picture depicting that event which might be used as a model for a sketch in order to save time.  The postoffice officials wrote to Manager Rosewater, who suggested this subject as a proper one for one of the stamps, and requested him to send a copy of a picture or a sketch, as nothing of the kind could be found in Washington.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rosewater searched local repositories for a copy of Lamprecht's famous painting depicting the famous missionary on the banks of the mighty Father of Waters.  This painting is regarded as the most authentic representation of the visit of the first white man to those regions in 1673 and is generally regarded as being historically correct.  No trace of the picture or of any copy of it could be found in Omaha and Mr. Rosewater wrote to the Marquette club in Chicago, thinking that a prominent club named for the great explorer might have this famous picture or might, at least, know something about it.  The answer indicated, however, that the club was in Egyptian darkness regarding the picture and its whereabouts.</p>
                            <p>Thinking that perhaps the picture might be somewhere in the region most frequented by the eminent Jesuit during the early days of the northwest, Mr. Rosewater telegraphed to Milwaukee and received a reply that the painting was there.  Arrangements were soon made for taking a photograph of the picture and the Postoffice department was notified that a photographic copy would be furnished immediately from which to make the design for the stamp.</p>
                            <p>Manager Rosewater has made another suggestion to the Postoffice department regarding these special stamps, since the department has announced the subjects which will be represented on them.  He has recommended that one of the denominations bear a design showing an event in the history of the great west which marks an epoch of national importance&#8212;the "driving of the golden spike" which completed the great transcontinental railway and tied together the Pacific and Atlantic.  It was suggested that such an event would be of greater historical importance and make the stamps more desirable as souvenirs than the representation of scenes such as have been selected for some of the stamps.</p>

Sixty business men, twenty from Omaha and forty from various points in the state, will compose the party, and they will travel in two sleepers, which will be decorated with banners heralding the exposition, while thousands of pamphlets and pictures will be distributed all along the line.</p>
                            <p>Arrangements have been made with business organizations along the route for meetings at which speakers who will accompany the party will have an opportunity to address large gatherings of citizens in the interest of the exposition.</p>

Stops of several hours will be made at nearly all of these points.  One Sunday will be spent on the road.  Rev. S. Wright Butler will accompany the party and the Sunday in question will be marked by two sermons delivered by Dr. Butler, the first at Cairo, Ill., Sunday morning and the second at Jackson, Tenn., the same evening.  It is on the program for the entire party to attend these services.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Executive Committee Takes Steps to Force Somebody's Hands.</head>
                            <p>At the meeting of the executive committee of the exposition yesterday afternoon a resolution was adopted directing the president and secretary of the exposition to make a demand upon the Omaha Water company for a supply of water for fire protection and other necessary uses on the exposition grounds and the legal counsel of the exposition was requested to prepare the formal requisition to be presented to the representatives of the water company.  Counsel Montgomery was notified at once of the action of the committee, and will have the document ready to be presented to the water company officials tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>Without coming to any decision, the committee had under consideration the course of action which is to follow in case the water company refuses to the demand and it was tacitly agreed that the next step should be through the city council and the courts.</p>
                            <p>It was the consensus of opinion among the members of the committee that in following this course the responsibility for whatever transpires in case of a protracted legal contest will rest upon the Commercial club and the other citizens who have opposed all negotiations looking to an amicable adjustment of the difficulty.</p>
                            <p>At Friday's meeting of the executive committee the salary of Chief Clerk Templeton of the Department of Buildings and Grounds was increased from $100 per month to $125, Mr. Kirkendall stating that it would be necessary for him to have Mr. Templeton's assistance at night as well as in the daytime, but no change was made in his title or official authority.</p>

                            <p>FORT SMITH, Ark., Feb. 5.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;The Commercial league of this city held a very enthusiastic meeting this morning with R. W. Richardson, special commissioner of the Omaha Transmississippi Exposition, which resulted in the unanimous adoption of the following resolutions:</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The Omaha exposition offers an excellent opportunity for advertising the resources of our state, and for correcting the false impression that Arkansas is simply and agricultural and horticultural state; and,</p>
                            <p>Whereas, The undeveloped mineral and other resources, such as coal, marble, marls, timber, zinc, lead, copper, onyx, phosphates, bauxite, shales, slates, manganese, novaculites, chalks and all kinds of clay used in the ceramic arts abound in Arkansas in unlimited quantity and of unexcelled and in many of them unequaled quality; therefore,</p>
                            <p>Resolved, That it would be an injustice to our state to make only a partial exhibit of its eastern agricultural resources, but that all the products of Arkansas should be represented at this exposition accordingly.</p>
                            <p>The Commercial league of Fort Smith heartily endorses the action of the state commissioners in deciding to have a state exhibit, and we will lend our efforts and enthusiastic support, and we would respectfully urge them and the people of the state to immediate and earnest efforts.</p>
                            <p>Fort Smith will take steps at once for a prominent exhibit, and the citizens are enthusiastic over the matter.</p>

                            <p>Texas will probably send a delegation to Omaha to "spy out the land" and take back reports to the state of the magnitude and extent of the exposition which the people of the entire United States are preparing to hold at Omaha during the coming summer.  Colonel S. J. T. Johnson, vice president of the exposition for Texas and chairman of the Texas Exposition commission, is making preparations to bring a large party, including the members of the commission, to Omaha in the near future to see for themselves just what is being done.  Secretary Tom Richardson of the Houston Business league and one of the moving spirits in exposition matters in Texas, has written to the exposition officials regarding the trip, and in reply a cordial invitation has been extended to the Texas commission to come to Omaha and examine for themselves just what is being done.</p>

The club was named "Iduna," and the officers elected were: President, Miss Emma Madler; vice president, Mrs. S. Sundgren; secretary, Miss Malin Johnson; financial secretary, Mrs. A. Anderson; treasurer, Mrs. N. Wagner; directors, Mrs. A. Gibson and Mrs. C. Nordenburg; business manager, Mrs. E. Schultz.  The society will defray the expenses of an independent float during the exposition parades.  The float will represent the industries of the Swedish woman from early day up to the present time and will contain a character to represent Jenny Lind, the Swedish nightingale.</p>

The overcrowded condition of several of the schools was relieved a couple of weeks ago by transferring classes and bringing in annexes from other districts.  Now the Long and Webster schools have become too small to hold the pupils and at the next meeting of the Board of Education some means must be devised to care for the overflow in these schools.</p>

                            <head type="sub">May Not Be Attached to the Indian Bill as Contemplated.</head>
                            <p>WASHINGTON, Feb. 5.&#8212;(Special Telegram.)&#8212;There is now no certainty that Senator Allen's amendment to the Indian bill appropriating $45,000 for an Indian congress will be attached to that appropriation bill, some difficulty being experienced in Senator Allison's committee to harmonize interests antagonistic to the measure.  As a result of a talk had today with Senator Allison, Senator Allen state tonight that he had positive assurances that the amendment would be attached to the sundry civil bill.  While this is a concession of considerable importance, it is thought here that the failure to place the amendment on the Indian bill will greatly jeopardize its chances of getting through the house, as Chairman Cannon of the house committee on appropriations will be one of the <choice><sic>conferrees</sic><corr>conferees</corr></choice> on the sundry civil bill, and he is known to be hostile to any increase of appropriations at this session.  On the other hand if the amendment goes on the Indian bill two of the three house conferees, Sherman of New York and Curtis of Kansas, it is believed, will vote with the senate conferees to keep the bill.  Senator Thurston will labor with the appropriations committee to place the amendment on the Indian bill and may have to carry the fight to the floor of the senate, where it is believed enough votes can be secured to attach the amendment to the Indian bill.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>A party of twelve newspaper representatives from Aurora and Geneva, Ill., Racine and Sheboygan, Wis., and DeWitt, Ia., arrived in Omaha last night and spent the morning visiting the exposition grounds and offices and acquiring information about the great enterprise in which their respective states are deeply interested.  Those in the party were: H. P. Howard, Aurora Express; J. H. Hodder, A. M. Snook, Aurora Beacon; Peter Klein, Aurora Volksfreund; R. F. Constantine, Aurora Post; Charles B. Mead, Geneva Republican; Ed C. Brown, DeWitt (Ia.) Observer; George Herzog, Racine Journal; John McFarlane, Racine Times; Charles Christenson, Racine News; Charles E. Lovelace, Sheboygan Journal, and Frank Zufelt, Sheboygan Telegram.</p>
                            <p>The party started from Chicago on the new fast train put in service yesterday by the Northwestern and Union Pacific between Chicago and Denver, and intended to return without coming as far west as Omaha.  On the road it was decided to continue to Omaha and visit the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The visitors stopped at the Millard hotel and this morning they were taken in charge by the Department of Publicity and Promotion and escorted to the office of the department in The Bee building.  Ex-Governor Peck of Milwaukee formed one of the party, and all were well supplied with printed matter relating to the exposition.  Manager Rosewater entertained them with a concise resume of the status of the exposition at the present time.  From here the party went direct to the grounds in charge of C. E. Llewellyn, an attache of the Promotion Department, and considerable time was spent in inspecting the general situation and the buildings.  The entire grounds were covered with mud to a depth of several inches, and pedestrianism was not the most agreeable occupation in the world, but the party made the best of the situation and visited all the buildings.</p>

                            <p>Every member of the party confessed that he was very greatly surprised at the magnitude of the whole affair.  Like all the other delegations which have come from other sections, they remarked that everything was "bigger than they supposed."</p>
                            <p>The bluff tract was visited and the state and other buildings in course of erection there were examined with a great deal of interest.  The Illinois members of the party were especially interested in the progress made on the Illinois building and were delighted at the great promise of beauty which the framework foreshadows.  The Wisconsin representatives surveyed with a great deal of interest the site which has been chosen for their state building, while the Iowa representative was dubious at the thought of the conditions in his state.</p>
                            <p>After returning to the hotel the <choice><sic>visttors</sic><corr>visitors</corr></choice> continue to express their surprise at the advanced state of the buildings.  J. H. Hodder of the Aurora Beacon seemed to voice the sentiments of the rest of the party when he exclaimed, "I supposed you had your buildings started, but I never thought that they were in such an advanced stage; why, they are nearly completed and could be finished within a very short time.  There's no denying the fact that they are beauties and the whole thing is going to be as beautiful as the World's fair.  The only criticism that occurs to me is that you are going to be greatly crowded in that main court.  You are going to have thousands of people in there and I doubt if you will have room for them."</p>
                            <p>The visitors spent the early hours of the afternoon in walking about the business districts of the city and went over to Council Bluffs about 3 o'clock.  They leave for home tonight.</p>

Manager Kirkendall has already purchased an ambulance for use on the exposition grounds during the summer and he has suggested to Dr. Spalding that the vehicle might be purchased by the city after the exposition at a greatly reduced figure, and thus benefit the exposition, while the city receives the benefit of a very low price.  Mr. Kirkendall says the ambulance which he has purchased is one of the most approved styles of vehicle, and is supplied with all conveniences.  While it is probable that the greatest demand for a vehicle of this kind will be inside the exposition grounds.  Mr. Kirkendall says that he has told Dr. Spalding that it could be used to a limited extent outside of the grounds, and thus serve the purpose of a city ambulance during the continuance of the exposition.  He has received no reply from the city physician regarding the matter.</p>

                            <p>The composite photograph of the two most beautiful women in each of the transmississippi states and territories, which is to form the model for the woman's head on one side of the exposition souvenir medal, is exciting considerable comment in many quarters.  The Minneapolis Times of recent date discourses learnedly on the subject after this fashion:</p>
                            <p>"The managers of the Transmississippi Exposition have decided upon a most interesting experiment along the lines of physiological anthropology.  When the much discussed composite photograph was first determined upon as being the best means of obtaining a model for the exposition medal, nothing was thought of the scientific value of such a photograph, containing as it will the features of the fairest women in all the different states and territories, but before the idea had been thoroughly discussed it was suggested that two pictures be made, one from the twenty-four photographs representing the west, and another from the twenty-four culled among the beauties of the east.  The question proposed for solution is just this: 'Will the two photographs display divergent types; and if so will the student of anthropology be able to tell at a glance which is the result of western pulchritude and which of eastern loveliness?'</p>
                            <p>"It may be seen readily enough that the crow's feet around the eyes of the Chicago maidens could be distinguished easily at a distance of some parasangs, and that the Boston <choice><sic>astygmatism</sic><corr>astigmatism</corr></choice> would show well to the front; but whether or not these characteristics would continue through the entire series of pictures is a very pretty problem.  Would the ox eyes of the Arizona maidens shine differently from the sheep's eyes cast upon the young photographer by the representative of old Virginia; and how about the moonshine in the glistening orbs of Kentucky's beauteous maids?"</p>

                            <p>The selecting of these photographs is proceeding in a promising manner in nearly all of the western states, and Manager Lindsey, under whose direction the work was undertaken, says that a full representation of western women will be obtained.  Some of <unclear/> proceeding slowly, but all <unclear/></p>
                            <p>Vice President Maxson of Nevada, who was in town Saturday of last week, said he had asked the exposition commissioner in each county of the state to select eight women in his county and send their photographs to the vice president, who will then make the selection of the two handsomest and send them to Manager Lindsey.  The commissioner of Washoe county, Nevada, has adopted the method of allowing all the women in the county to vote on the matter.  Each woman is allowed to vote for the eight women in the county whom she considers the best looking, but she is required to make her choice in writing and sign her name to the ballot in order to avoid "repeaters."  The eight receiving the highest vote will be selected and their photographs sent to the vice president.</p>
                            <p>Vice President F. H. Peavey of Minnesota has appointed a committee of judges to secure the pictures of Minnesota's handsomest young women and make the selection.  The headquarters of the committee are in Minneapolis, Ik Hallowell being the secretary.  The Minneapolis papers report that the committee is receiving a large number of photographs from the most prominent people in Minnesota society and the boast is made that the photographs of the daughters of the North Star state will be the handsomest of the entire collection.</p>
                            <p>The most novel plan for making selections which has developed up to this time comes from New Mexico.  The vice president for that territory, ex-Governor Prince, decided that the subject of one of the photographs should be a woman of Mexican origin and the other an Anglo-American.  The wife of Hon. Sol Luna, a prominent citizen of the territory, was selected as the most beautiful of the first class and it was decided that the choice of the second woman should be left to a vote of the people of the territory, each vote to cost 25 cents.  By this means it is hoped to raise a fund to increase the small appropriation made by the legislature for an exhibit.</p>

Times of recent date contained a column article relating to the Transmississippi and International Exposition, written by Editor Francis, who is well known in Omaha.  He visited this city recently and made a personal inspection of the exposition grounds and offices, gathering the information which he embodied in the article in question, which is herewith given in full:</p>
                            <p>It has been conclusively demonstrated that the American people of the present day delight in big expositions.  After World's fair at Chicago closed its gates it was argued that the people could afford to wait for many years before undertaking another show of similar character.  But they did not wait.  Instead, they proceeded to organize a series of expositions, which, while much smaller in scope, nevertheless were of the same general character and included all the features which made the Chicago fair so popular and so successful.  First came the exposition at Atlanta, which, while very creditable to the people of Georgia and of the south, was only a partial success.  This was followed last year by the Tennessee Centennial Exposition at Nashville, which was a complete success, both financially and from the artistic point of view.  But this year both the Atlanta and the Nashville expositions are to be eclipsed.  The great west has taken up the contract and what the great west makes up its mind to do it generally accomplishes.  June 1 the gates of the Transmississippi and International Exposition at Omaha will be opened to the public and if visitors do not find therein a display greater and more attractive than anything of the kind presented since 1893 there will be good reason for surprise.</p>
                            <p>The idea of holding this big show at Omaha originated in 1895 at the session of the Transmississippi congress, when resolutions endorsing the project and selecting Omaha as the exposition site were adopted.  Since that time much has been accomplished by a display of characteristic western enterprise.  The work of organization alone was stupendous in its proportions, for the exposition, as the name chosen indicates, is not to be a merely local affair, but will be international in its scope.  Invitations to participate were promptly sent to foreign nations and most of the important commercial countries of both continents are preparing to make good use of the opportunity offered for the exhibition of proofs of their industrial progress.  The
                            
                            <pb n="228" xml:id="TMISB03-228"/>
                            
                            management of the exposition is in the hands of a corporation, the stockholders of which number almost 8,000.  The capital stock is $1,000,000, more than half of which has been subscribed, with further subscriptions constantly coming in.  In addition to the stock subscriptions the corporation will have at its disposal revenues from the sale of space and concessions aggregating not less than $1,000,000, together with gate receipts estimated, on the basis of an attendance of 3,000,000, at not less than $1,100,000.  These figures, which are conservative, <choice><sic>aparently</sic><corr>apparently</corr></choice> insure the financial success of the undertaking.</p>
                            <p>Not only is Omaha advantageously located for attracting visitors to such an exposition, but it also affords an unrivaled site for the exposition grounds.  These are situated in the northern part of the city and cover an area of 200 acres.  The natural advantages are many, and the architects and landscape engineers have improved their opportunities to the utmost.  The main buildings of the exposition are grouped along a great lagoon 150 feet wide and half a mile in length, thus concentrating the architectural effect.  These buildings include the Auditorium, Manufactures, Liberal Arts, Fine Arts, United States Government, Agriculture, Mines and Mining and Machinery and Electricity buildings.  The buildings are each from 300 to 400 feet in length and from 125 to 150 feet in width, and the architecture is decidedly ornate and even elaborate.  The Government building, when completed, will be 500 feet long and almost 200 feet from the ground to the top of its gilded dome.  Already congress has appropriated $200,000 for the building and exhibit, and bills are now pending for an additional appropriation of $100,000.  In addition to these main buildings there will be two great arches of impressive size and appearance, one, to be known as the Arch of States, being located over the main entrance, and the other, the Administration arch, on the north side of the main court.  There will also be a number of state buildings, appropriations having been made by various western legislatures.</p>
                            <p>The Chicago World's fair taught the world a valuable lesson concerning the erection of buildings for temporary use that may be handsome and attractive, without being exceedingly expensive.  By the use of that convenient composition known to the builder as "staff" a wooden building may take on the appearance of a massive edifice constructed of marble.  The Omaha exposition buildings will be of wood, finished in staff with the tint of old marble.  At prominent points they will be colored in green and gold, giving a pleasing effect.  They will be adorned with classic sculpture, intricate carving and in some instances with statuary of heroic size.  The grounds will be beautified with fine lawns and flower beds, while the lagoon will receive the most artistic treatment.  At either end will be boat landings, while in the center, where the lagoon is spanned by an ornamental bridge, is a little island which will add much to the beauty of the scene.  In the more remote portions of the grounds the dairy, apiary and poultry buildings, the handsome horticultural hall and the big power plant and Transportation building.</p>
                            <p>It goes without saying that Omaha will have a midway plaisance.  This is a feature that all expositions now borrow from the Chicago fair, even though they may borrow nothing else.  It is promised that the Omaha midway will be especially fine and its popularity is assured.  The midway will also have its Moorish, Afro-American, New Mexican Indian and other foreign villages, its Cripple Creek camp, its "devil's den," with a Dante's "Inferno" continuous performance going on inside; its baby incubator, wild west show, scenic railways, shoot-the-chutes, battle cycloramas, etc.</p>
                            <p>That Americans in general and the people of the transmississippi section in particular fully appreciate the advantages to be gained through the medium of this exposition is shown by the fact that the demand for space and concessions has been unprecedented, and in some departments this demand has exceeded the space that can be allotted.  Quite naturally, a good share of the exhibits will be from the far west, the intention being to show the marvelous progress made by that section.  In this respect the exposition should be of great advantage to the western people.  It will show them as they are&#8212;an enterprising, progressive people, undaunted in the face of great undertakings and conscious of their ability to succeed.  To all of the millions of visitors who will pass through the turnstiles between June 1 and November 1, when the exposition will close, the fact will be made apparent that the people of the transmississippi states are alert, energetic, proud of their achievements and anxious to accomplish still greater and better things.</p>

                            <head type="sub">San Francisco and Northern Counties Plan for the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>Northern California is taking a decided interest in the exposition and the indications are that the northern counties and the city of San Francisco will be on hand with a fine exhibit.</p>
                            <p>An enthusiastic meeting of business men was held at the San Francisco Board of Trade building last Wednesday and the question of whether the northern counties should secure space for an exhibit was discussed at considerable length by the members of the eight trade and commercial organizations represented.</p>
                            <p>A. G. McAusland, special commissioner for the exposition, addressed the meeting and spoke of the benefit which the state would derive from an exhibition of its products and industries.  He stated that Los Angeles and the southern counties had secured 2,000 feet of space.  He wanted to know what space San Francisco and the northern counties would desire.  An offer of 1,000 feet of space had been made by the directors for a mining exhibit.  He said that space in the Horticultural building would have to be paid for.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Watkins spoke in favor of an exhibit.  He said:  "We should show the people of the Mississippi valley what we can produce.  It would induce people to come here."  He did not think it necessary to have a mining exhibit, as people who have good mines do not care to sell them and would not care much about bringing out purchasers.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Phelan favored an exhibit.  He suggested that a better showing could be made by co-operating with Los Angeles and the southern counties.  The two exhibits could be kept together and made a general state exhibit.  He thought that the supervisors would contribute $3,000 toward the exhibit.  They could pledge the credit of the city for this amount and provide the money in the next tax levy.  The remainder of the money could be raised by private subscription.  He thought that if $5,000 more was raised a creditable showing could be made.  One-half might be raised in San Francisco and the other half in the other counties.</p>
                            <p>On motion of the mayor the chairman was authorized to appoint a committee of three to confer with the State Board of Trade to ascertain whether a creditable exhibit could be made in 2,000 feet of space, and what sum would be required to make such display.  The committee was requested to ascertain what freight rates could be secured, and also to communicate with the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce to learn whether the southern counties would cooperate with the rest of the state in making a general exhibit; also, to petition the supervisors for an appropriation for an exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Chairman Watkins stated that he would announce the names of this committee today.</p>
                            <p>A committee on promotion, consisting of Mayor Phelan, John T. Bell and J. W. Kerr, was appointed.  The meeting adjourned until next Wednesday.</p>

                            <p>The Lincoln (Neb.) News delivers the following regarding a habit which obtains among people outside of Omaha:</p>
                            <p>It is quite noticeable that the public is falling into the habit of referring to the Transmississippi Exposition as the "Omaha fair" or the "Omaha exposition."  With all due credit to the enterprise and public spirit of Omaha's citizens, the fact remains that the exposition is not to be for or of Omaha alone and should not be called the "Omaha exposition."  The people and the press of that city themselves gave it the name "Transmississippi" and do not ask anyone to adopt the other name.  The scope of the exposition is to be "transmississippi".  Its spirits and results will be the same and that term means more than "Omaha;" it will be more potent to move here the wealth of California, the exhibits of Texas and Montana and the travelers from the east.  So, simply for the good of the fair itself, let it be called the Transmississippi Exposition.</p>

                            <p>The Topeka (Kan.) Capital says that the Union Pacific and Burlington railways have declined to contribute $5,000 each to the fund for a state exhibit by Kansas at the exposition.  The Rock Island, Santa Fe and Missouri Pacific are said to have agreed some time ago to contribute $5,000 each to this fund and it is expected that an equal or larger amount will be secured by private subscriptions.</p>
                            <p>A. E. Stilwell, president of the Pittsburg &amp; Gulf Railroad company, has subscribed $4,000 to the fund being raised in Missouri for a state exhibit.</p>

                            <p>The Wisconsin Horticultural society has made an appropriation of $500 for the purpose of making an exhibit.</p>
                            <p>Maryland is taking steps to secure the placing of an exhibit at the exposition.  Money for making the exhibit is to be raised by popular subscriptions among the business men of the state.</p>
                            <p>The information comes from Surprise, Neb., that the pet cow of the citizens of the town was delivered of a calf, which has eight legs.  It is reported that the freak was sold to parties, who intend exhibiting it at the exposition.</p>
                            <p>The High School cadets of Kansas City, Mo., are endeavoring to secure the endorsement of the Commercial club of that city in their effort to represent the city at the opening of the exposition and to remain here two weeks inspecting the exhibits.</p>
                            <p>The governor of Texas has appointed the following as additional vice presidents to <unclear/> Surrior, Dallas; R. W. <unclear/> Andrews, San Antonio; D. C. Kulp, Iowa Park; Tom Richardson, Houston; J. M. Claburn.  Hon J. D. Rowell of Jefferson has accepted the vice presidency of the First senatorial district.</p>
                            <p>The business men of St. Louis have decided to have a building at the exposition.  It will not be used for the purpose of housing exhibits, but instead, will be a place for St. Louis and Missouri visitors to rest and enjoy themselves.  The St. Louis commission has addressed a letter to the business men of that city, urging them to secure a large exhibit for the exposition.</p>

                            <head type="sub">NEED OF DIRECTOR GENERAL APPARENT</head>
                            <head type="sub">Subject of Inaugurating New Methods to Be Discussed at Directors' Meeting to Be Held Next Friday Afternoon.</head>
                            <div3>
                            <p>There are indications that when the Board of Directors of the exposition meets, Friday of this week, at 4 p. m., there will be a change inaugurated in the method of administering the affairs of the exposition.  Up to this time the work of preparing for the exposition has been classified under six departments, each having at its head a manager, who is a member of the executive committee, which is vested with full authority in all matters connected with the exposition.  As the work of preparation has advanced, the province of one department has infringed upon the functions of the others and considerable confusion has resulted.  In the practical workings of the enterprise there are six heads, and those having business with the management are sent about from pillar to post without being able to find a man whose decision can be regarded as final.</p>
                            <p>This condition of affairs has excited a great deal of unfavorable comment from outsiders coming to the city to transact business with the exposition management and criticism from people who have had occasion to conduct negotiations by correspondence.  These matters have come to the ears of the directors and have been seriously discussed by members of the executive committee.  There has been no disposition whatever on the part of those familiar with the affairs of the exposition criticise the members of the executive committee for these conditions.  They are regarded as the logical outcome of the system of management which was inaugurated at the inception of the exposition.  Each member of the executive committee is the active head of a large business enterprise on his own account and to add the guidance of one of the extensive departments of the exposition to his burdens is like piling Ossa upon Pelion.  Meetings of the executive committee are held every day, but each member is loaded down with his private business, as well as with exposition business, and the sessions of the committee rarely last over an hour.  Each head of a department is thrown almost entirely upon his own resources in the management of his department and works out the details in the way that seems to him to be best, while remaining in darkness as to what the other departments are doing.  The result is that in some matters the departments are working at cross-purposes and the recipient of correspondence from two or more of them is at a loss to tell what to do.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">ONE CASE IN POINT.</head>
                            <p>This condition of affairs was well exemplified recently in the case of the business conducted with the officers of the United States mint at Philadelphia.  To an agent of the exposition who was recently in the City of Brotherly Love, one of the mint officials said: "Why don't your exposition have one head?  We have had letters from three or four different people connected with the exposition regarding the medals, and each one wants something different from the others.  How can we tell what to do?"  Other instances of the same kind are occurring constantly and strangers coming to the city, especially those who have had to do with former expositions, continually remark that the exposition seems to have no head.</p>
                            <p>The conviction has been growing upon many of the directors that a change must be made and some position created where the general direction of the work of all the departments shall be centralized.  A number of the directors have expressed themselves in favor of creating some such position at this time.  There is a difference of opinion among them as to the advisability of creating the position of director general, with the authority that such designation implies, but the consensus of opinion seems to be in favor of creating the office of general superintendent of the exposition, an officer who shall have general direction of all departments under the supervision of the executive

                            committee.  It is the decided opinion of many of the directors who have given the matter attention that some step of this kind must be taken at once to avoid the inextricable confusion which must inevitably follow if the present system is continued.  The advocates of this latest plan argue that it would allow the employment of a competent man to supervise all of the work, and thus prevent departments from working in contrary directions, while the full authority of the executive committee would be preserved.</p>
                            </div3>
                            <div3>
                            <head type="sub">HERE ARE OBJECTORS.</head>
                            <p>Certain of the concessionaires who have business with the various departments have been making most vigorous protests for some time at the unsatisfactory manner in which affairs are conducted.  The concessionaires, as a rule, are men who have had much to do with expositions and may be considered as experts in the matter under consideration.  They are a unit in declaring that they are unable to tell just what to do, as they are told one thing by one department and something directly contrary by another.</p>
                            <p>The representatives of the different departments of the federal government on the Board of Control who have been here have expressed the greatest surprise when told that there is no one man who is in general charge.</p>
                            <p>A man who has had considerable experience in exposition work, but who is now engaged in business in the city, remarked very recently that exposition affairs were getting in a very bad tangle.  "I have been watching things pretty closely," said he, "and I can see that the management is getting into a very bad condition.  I don't believe the officers realize the shape affairs are in, but I make the prediction that in less than a month they will have a very rude awakening and will then be glad to solve the difficulty in any way.  It is simply impossible to conduct any exposition with six heads, each running his department independent of all the rest.  No one having business with them knows who is authority and everything is bound to be tangled up.  There is something to be considered besides getting the buildings ready, but this task seems to have overshadowed everything else.  Unless everything is centralized within a very short time there will be such confusion that it cannot be remedied and the exposition will be a failure."</p>

                            <p>Acting in accordance with the resolution passed by the executive committee at its meeting last Saturday, President Wattles and Secretary Wakefield executed the following formal demand, prepared by C. S. Montgomery, the counsel of the exposition and served it yesterday afternoon upon E. L. Bierbower, manager of the Omaha Water company:</p>
                            <p>"To the Omaha Water Company:  You are hereby notified that the Transmississippi and International Exposition needs a supply of water for various uses and purposes at and upon its grounds located in the northern part of the city of Omaha, for which purpose it has constructed and ready for use water mains throughout its grounds, with connections for distributing water to and for the various uses and purposes required by the said exposition, the principal main of said system being laid in such situation and manner as to enable you to make connections between the same and your water main.  You are hereby required and the undersigned demands that you make such connections as are necessary and immediately furnish to the Transmississippi and International Exposition the water which is now requires and will require for all its uses and purposes.  For the water thus furnished as required the said Transmississippi and International Exposition agrees to pay such compensation as is reasonable and as you may lawfully require.</p>
                            <p>"In witness whereof the said Transmississippi and International Exposition has caused these presents to be executed in its name and its corporate seal to be attached by its proper and duly authorized officers thus 7th day of February, A. D., 1898."</p>
                            <p>As soon as this was received Mr. Bierbower turned it over to the attorneys of the water company in this city&#8212;J. M. Woolworth and R. S. Hall.  He stated that he would confer with these attorneys and that a conclusion would probably be reached some time during the day and a formal reply made to the exposition officials.  Mr. Bierbower declined to indicate the probable nature of the reply.</p>

                            <p>OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 7.&#8212;(Special.)&#8212;The indications that California will be represented at the Omaha exposition are very encouraging.  A meeting was held in San Francisco yesterday to discuss this subject, whereat were present Mayor Phelan and representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, State Board of Trade, Manufacturers' and Producers' association, San Francisco Board of Trade and other local organizations.  At the outset some discouraging remarks were made, as it was feared there would be difficulty experienced in raising the money needed to make a large display, but the tide was turned by a sensible speech by Mayor Phelan, who said that no doubt free transportation for a moderate sized exhibit would be furnished by the Southern Pacific; that quality more than quantity was what was required; that California should send those articles for which it was specially desired to find a market; that there was no necessity for making a large mineral display, as the reputation of the state in that line was well established, and that by joining with southern California in space and outlay the expense could be kept down to a reasonable figure.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Watkins, president of the San Francisco Board of Trade, said that California's state pride was involved in this matter, and that it would be a disgrace for the state to not be represented at this exposition.</p>
                            <p>Finally a motion was made and adopted providing for the appointment of a committee of three to confer with the directors of the State Board of Trade and ascertain what that body could do in the premises, to ascertain whether or not free transportation for the display could be had from the railroad company, to consult with the State Mining association in regard to a mineral exhibit and to correspond with the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce with a view of making a joint exhibit.  A like committee was appointed to secure the aid of the city press.</p>
                            <p>Mr. A. G. McAusland, special commissioner for the Pacific coast, was present, and aided materially in advancing the interests of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>Chairman W. I. Kierstead of the Board of County Commissioners, County Treasurer Heimrod and County Clerk Haverly went to Lincoln yesterday to receive the money for the Douglas county exposition bonds, which were sold to the state of Nebraska and which were declared legal by the supreme court at its last sitting.</p>
                            <p>The bond issue was for $100,000 and on this the state of Nebraska offered a premium of $6,850, this being the highest bid.  In paying the amount Treasurer Meserve clipped from the bonds the first coupon on each, representing the first six months' interest, $2,250, and turned them over to County Treasurer Heimrod.  This action was taken in compliance with the state law, which requires that the state shall not pay interest on bonds purchased by it in cases where provision has not been made, in advance, for the payment of the first coupons.  As no provision had been made by Douglas county for a levy to pay these coupons the state treasurer had no alternative.  By this action the taxpayers of Douglas county are saved this amount of money, $2,250, as the state of Nebraska carries the bonds until the next coupons become due without receiving any interest from the county for the money which has been paid for the bonds.</p>
                            <p>The money paid to the county officials was divided and four checks were drawn on four state depositories in Omaha and these were turned over to the representatives of Douglas county, who at once left the capital city for Omaha, and the accounts of Douglas county were at once credited with the full amount.</p>

                            <p>OMAHA, Feb. 7.&#8212;To the Editor of The Bee:  As to the opening or closing of the exposition on Sundays I would say that the Evangelical Lutheran church, from a biblical and confessional standpoint, finds and advocates that no command or restriction of any kind is given to the church of the New Testament as to the observance of any special day.  Matthew xi, 8; Rom. xiv, 15, 16; Col. ii, 16, 17; Aug. Conf., art xv and xxviii.  The selection of our Sunday is not of a divine origin; but an institution of the church.  It is, therefore, an outrage to demand the closing of the exposition from a biblical and religious standpoint, professing to do this in obedience of the Master's will.  Such doctrine is non-biblical, absurd and ridiculous.  While we sincerely endorse good moral reasons to close this institution on Sundays on part of the government or exposition authorities, we defy the argument that it is the church's duty to dictate to the state and worldly authorities anything whatever in such affairs.  Let church and state stay separated forever.  Matthew xxi, 21; John xviii, 36.  Let members of the church, as good citizens, also, see to the interest of our city and state, but whatever is done by Christians or non-Christians, for church or state, let them do it from a right standpoint, without interfering in the right of one or the other.</p>

                            <p>Vice President Neville, after conference with Superintendent Lindsey, has been authorized to extend the time for the selection of the two most beautiful women in the state to March 1.  This action is taken for the reason that but very few of the photographs sent in showed the left side of the face and the attention of the women and their friends is called to the fact that the photographs should show the left side of the face and be a complete profile, such as is represented upon a silver dollar.  The face should be looking to the right.  Women and photographers who did not before understand the instructions, will now have an opportunity to send Vice President Neville photographs which can be considered in making the selection.  He is proud of the collection which he now has, but he insists that Nebraska has more beautiful women than any other state in the union and he wishes to select the most beautiful.  He therefore requests that the friends of some of these numerous women send photographs of them to him at North Platte in time to be considered in this selection.</p>

                            <p>A California man has made application to the Department of Concessions for the privilege of operating a scenic canal on a large scale.  He wants about three acres of ground in a long strip and on this he proposes to construct a canal with a strong current produced by artificial means.  Along the sides of the canal he says he will construct a series of views of California scenery, including the Yosemite valley and falls, with the foreground constructed of earth and rocks after the fashion of a cyclorama.  He is soliciting the co-operation of the officials of the counties in California with a view of having them utilize the foreground for exhibits of the agricultural and other resources of these counties.  This proposition is now under consideration by the concessions department and Superintendent Burns states that a concession will probably be granted.</p>

                            <head type="sub">City Enjoined from Waiving Right to Purchase Water Plant.</head>
                            <p>After a rather one-sided hearing yesterday afternoon Judge Scott granted W. S. Poppleton a temporary injunction to restrain the mayor and city council from waiving the right of the city to purchase the plant of the Omaha Water company in 1903 in return for free water service on the exposition grounds during the exposition, for reimbursing the exposition company in cash for the $20,000 or more which it has already invested in laying water mains and for any other valuable considerations.</p>
                            <p>At 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon the two attorneys were as far apart as in the morning.  City Attorney Connell appeared with the affidavits of the councilmen in accordance with his agreement and again insisted that he was ready to admit all the matters of record alleged in the affidavits of the <choice><sic>relators</sic><corr>realtors</corr></choice> in order that the matter might be settled as soon as possible.  He said it was absolutely essential that something should be done to secure water service for the exposition grounds as it was without fire protection and it would be nothing more or less than a calamity to the city if the buildings were destroyed by fire.</p>
                            <p>The attorney for Mr. Poppleton was not willing, however, that City Attorney Connell should admit only his affidavits.  He insisted that he must also admit the allegation he made in his petition.  City Attorney Connell refused positively to do this, saying that he would then admit that the council had entered into fraud when they proposed to pass the ordinance.  Finally City Attorney Connell turned to Mr. Poppleton and asked:</p>
                            
                            <pb n="230" xml:id="TMISB03-230"/>
                            
                            <p>"Do you want a speedy hearing?"</p>
                            <p>"I want this injunction to go on in the regular way without regard to whether or not the final hearing is early or late," answered Mr. Poppleton.</p>
                            <p>Judge Scott stated that there seemed to be no likelihood of an agreement on the part of the attorneys.  He said he saw the advantage of an early final hearing, but he could not force Mr. Poppleton to it.  Therefore he called the attorneys to proceed at once upon the application for a temporary injunction.  Upon that, City Attorney Connell stated that he would not take any part in the proceedings except on a final hearing and shortly after withdrew from the court room.  Thereupon the attorney for Mr. Poppleton made his showing for the temporary injunction, which consisted of the reading of his petitions and affidavits.  Upon this showing the temporary injunction was granted.  When the court asked what time he should set for the hearing for a permanent injunction Mr. Poppleton said he did not wish the case advanced.  Therefore no date was set, but the case will come up when its turn is reached on the docket.</p>

                            <head type="sub">County Turns Over $50,000 of Proceeds of Bond Sale.</head>
                            <p>This morning the Board of County Commissioners held an adjourned meeting from yesterday, at which it turned over to the exposition a portion of the proceeds from the exposition bonds.  The amount which was thus given over was $50,000.</p>
                            <p>The appropriation sheet by which the sum was authorized to be paid over to the exposition also set out the method in which the money is to be expended.  Of the $50,000, $15,000 is to be used in the improving and beautifying of the grounds; $12,000 toward the construction of the Agricultural building, $10,000 toward the construction of the Manufactures building, $5,000 to the Fine Arts building and $3,000 toward maintaining the buildings and grounds.</p>
                            <p>President Wattles, Secretary Wakefield and Member Lindsey of the Board of Exposition Directors were present.  They endeavored to secure the entire $75,000 which the commissioners by resolution last December decided to turn over to the exposition, but the commissioners did not see their way clear to do this.  Under their plan they can turn over the money only as the big buildings are completed and therefore they will hold the remaining $25,000 until the five other structures are complete.  The other $25,000 will be devoted to a county exhibit.</p>
                            <p>By resolution of Commissioner Kierstead saloon licenses were granted to Henry Villstadt, Henry Seidler, L. D. Hopkins and Fritz Koch, they having finally complied with the law in having advertised their applications for a license in The Evening Bee as the paper having the largest circulation in the county.  All the cases had been protested by The Bee because of the non-advertisement in that paper.</p>

                            <p>The reception of the mayor's approval of the levy ordinance and the subsequent passage of the January appropriation ordinance and the refunding bond ordinance are about all the important business that is on the card for the city council meeting tonight.</p>
                            <p>Mayor Moores has affixed his official signature to the levy ordinance, so that is settled and the various departments will have to get along on the appropriations that have been provided.  The bond ordinance will probably be passed without objection, but there are breakers ahead when the question of issuing the bonds thus authorized comes to be considered.  In determining the amount to be issued the obligations that are to be redeemed must be considered and then the fight over the settlement of the claims of the Barber Asphalt company must be settled.</p>
                            <p>The most gratifying piece of business to several hundred city employes will be the passage of the January appropriation ordinance that has been passed for two or three months.  The ordinance will contain only the January salaries, leaving the back salaries to be provided for by the refunding bonds, but even one month's pay is welcomed by men who have not drawn a cent from the city since November 1.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ONE HEAD FOR THE EXPOSITION</head>
                            <head type="sub">Need of Some One Man Who Will Be Responsible and Direct the Work Under the Executive Committee.</head>
                            <p>As the time approaches for the next regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the exposition the sentiment of the directors is crystallizing in favor of the creation of the office of general superintendent of the exposition referred to in The Bee yesterday or of some other office which shall have general direction of the whole work under the control of the executive committee.  This is especially true in the case of those directors who have had occasion to see the practical workings of the system now in vogue.  These men express their firm conviction that a change is imperative, but say they have some delicacy about insisting on it unless the executive committee gives its full consent to the change.  Among this class is Director J. H. Evans.</p>
                            <p>"I believe there should be a change in the system at once," said Mr. Evans.  "The members of the executive committee have accomplished wonders and deserve great credit for what has been done, but it stands to reason that they cannot give their whole time to the exposition.  Matters have come to the point where the affairs of the exposition must be in the hands of experienced men who can guide the whole thing and I believe the best solution of the difficulties that now exist is the selection of some competent man to have general charge.  I do not think the executive committee should have its authority curtailed in any way, but it should continue to have general charge and leave the details to one man to work out.</p>
                            <p>"I had occasion a few days ago," continued Mr. Evans, "to go with a customer of our bank to exposition headquarters, where he desired to transact certain business.  We were sent from one man to another until we had seen three men and each one gave us a different answer.  The man I was with became disgusted and said he had no further time to waste and he came away without having made any progress.  If one man had authority to say yes or no, that would settle it and strangers would not be annoyed by a lot of different authorities."</p>
                            <p>President Wattles said he had not changed his opinion that an office should be created where the whole work of the exposition should be centralized, but he added that he should do nothing to urge such a course until the executive committee is a unit in favor of it.</p>
                            <p>Other members of the directory expressed themselves in favor of the move referred to, but said they would have some delicacy about proceeding unless the whole executive committee favored it, as that body was charged with the responsibility for making the exposition a success and would have to bear the brunt of a failure.  These directors said, however, that they deemed it only common business prudence to so concentrate the forces that there would be less strength lost by departments working at cross-purposes along given lines.</p>
                            <p>The question of creating the position of general superintendent or director general was under discussion at the meeting of the executive committee yesterday and was warmly debated for about two hours.  The majority of the committee is reported to be in favor of appointing a general superintendent, but it is stated on good authority that one member of the committee objected most vigorously to the suggestion and was inclined to regard it as a personal affront.</p>

                            <p>"You may tell the Omaha people that Denver will be at the exposition and will make a showing creditable to the city," said Mayor McMurray to a Bee man yesterday in his office at Denver.</p>
                            <p>The exposition has taken a hold on the Denver people at last and there is a wave of enthusiasm manifest which is cheerful to contemplate in contrast with the apathy heretofore noticed.  The appointment of Mr. A. T. Macdonald to represent the exposition at Denver is a very popular one.  The wide acquaintance of Mr. Macdonald in the city and his personal popularity gives him opportunities to reach people that could never be enjoyed by a stranger, however pushing he might be.  The vigor with which Mr. Macdonald has gone to work is also inspiring.  In connection with the Denver city commission he has organized meeting after meeting, one being held last night, a report of which appears in the telegraph columns, and another for tonight, and says this will be his program until the exhibit from Denver, building and all, is secured.  Mayor McMurray is giving the matter a great deal of his own time and promises to do all he can to forward it to a successful conclusion.  Mr. McMurray is well remembered by older citizens of Omaha as a former Gate City business man, and while be is as loyal to the interests of the Queen City as any in it, he has not forgotten his residence here, nor his friends.</p>
                            <p>Governor Adams is still energetically at work with the state commission and has written personal letters to the county boards of the state, pointing out what, in his opinion, is a successful way to arrange for funds to cover the expense of an exhibit for the state at large.  He with others interested promises that Colorado will be here with a good showing.</p>
                            <p>The newspapers of Denver are taking hold of it with great energy and columns are now devoted to the affairs, where a few weeks ago only lines were given.</p>

                            <p>Vice President S. J. T. Johnson of Corsicana, Tex., who is chairman of the Texas Exposition commission, is in the city in the interest of his state to look over the exposition grounds and make arrangements for space for the display to be made by Texas.  After seeing the buildings and walking around the grounds his enthusiasm was aroused to the highest pitch and he was most emphatic in his statements that his state must make a creditable showing.</p>
                            <p>"Our people do not comprehend the magnitude and full scope of this exposition," he declared with emphasis.  "Neither do they fully comprehend the great benefit our state will derive from having a good exhibit of its resources at this show.  I am free to say that I did not have even a faint idea of the magnificence which I have seen at the grounds and the evidences on every hand of the broad scope of this exposition.  Our state has been rather backward about making exhibits at former exposition, but I believe the time has now come to show the other states that we have just what we claim to have&#8212;the best, as well as the biggest, state in the union, and the one with the most diversified resources.</p>
                            <p>"I have reserved 2,000 feet of floor space and 1,500 feet of wall space in the Agriculture building and 200 feet in the Mines building.  We ought to have more space, but we have no state appropriation and are having more or less difficulty in raising money for the exhibit.  I believe this difficulty is owing to the ignorance of the true situation and I shall try to remove that as much as possible, but whether I succeed in increasing our space or not I can guarantee that our state will have a fine exhibit.  We have a commission composed of one member in each senatorial district in the state and good work is being done.  Our people have a warm spot in their hearts for Nebraska</p>

                            <p>"This continued abuse of an important employe of the exposition by one of its managers is not only an unfortunate spectacle for the public, but is certain to work harm to the exposition.  Mr. Walker's only offense seems to lie in the fact that he, as vice president of the American Institute of Architects, has insisted that the usual courtesy be shown by Mr. Rosewater's department to the exposition architects, unless it be consider an offense to have obtained for the exposition some free advertising in certain periodicals that seem to be out of the regular line of the Department of Publicity.</p>
                            <p>"As it has been at the request of the executive committee that Mr. Walker has allowed these attacks to go unanswered, I feel justified in asking the committee to protect him from any further abuse.  Yours respectfully,</p>

                            <p>Art <choice><sic>Dirctor</sic><corr>Director</corr></choice> A. H. Griffiths has issued a circular to all artists and people owning works of art who may desire or consent to the exhibition at the Transmississippi Exposition of their works.  The circular announces that the exposition authorities believe that the purchase of pictures will be a greater encouragement to <choice><sic>rtists</sic><corr>artists</corr></choice> than the awarding of medals and have, therefore, authorized the purchase of works from exhibitors to the extent of not less than $5,000, and that there is good reason to believe that this sum will be increased by citizens of Omaha.</p>
                            <p>Rules governing the art exhibit are announced in this circular as follows:</p>
                            <p>No accepted work can be withdrawn before the close of the exhibition and all works must remain as placed by the hanging committee.</p>
                            <p>The superintendent will attend to sales upon which a commission of 10 per cent will be charged.  Prices should be stated on the list when sent in.</p>
                            <p>In consideration of the consignment of approved works to this exhibit the Transmississippi and International Exposition directorate agrees:  (1) That all expenses of collecting, packing, shipping and returning such works shall be paid by the said Transmississippi and International Exposition.  (2) That the Transmississippi and International Exposition will insure such works, while in transit and during their exhibition, at a valuation agreed upon between the owners and the association or its duly authorized agent.  (3) That the superintendent will make diligent effort to find purchasers for such works as may be offered for sale.  (4) That all works unsold at the close of the exposition shall be returned to their owners at the earliest possible moment, in as good condition as when received from said owners, this clause being understood to cover frames as well as pictures.</p>
                            <p>Honorary commissioners of the art bureau and committee on selection are announced as follows:  Jules Rolshoven, England; Frederick Mayer, France; Dr. C. Hofsteded de Groot, Holland; W. M. R. French, Illinois; John L. Griffith, Indiana; Stephen N. Crosby, Massachusetts; Charles L. Freer, Michigan; Thomas B. Walker, Minnesota; F. L.

                            <head type="sub">Architect Clas of Milwaukee Here to Settle the Preliminaries.</head>
                            <p>Alfred C. Clas, treasurer of the Wisconsin Exposition commission and architect of the proposed Wisconsin building to be erected on the fair grounds, was in the city today and made a personal inspection of the exposition grounds and the proposed location of the building for a more intelligent idea of the requirements in the way of decorations.  He passed the morning in conference with T. R. Kimball, one of the architects-in-chief, and visited the grounds in the rain, where he made a casual survey of the situation.</p>
                            <p>"Wisconsin will begin the construction of her building within a few weeks," said Mr. Clas to The Bee at the Millard after he had disposed of the business that brought him to Omaha.  "We intend to spend about $15,000 on our building and the money is now being raised by popular subscription throughout the state to meet the requirements of a fine state building and a first-class exhibit.  Our building will be exclusively almost a state club house of the classic order of architecture, and the best feature of the structure will be the grand fish pond in the center of it, as well as the big aquarium which will be constructed under the stairway.  The people of Wisconsin are proud of their fisheries and one of their greatest efforts will be to display this feature to the best possible advantage.</p>
                            <p>"The interior of the building will present a Pompeiian style of architecture and the reception and lounging rooms will be decorated almost entirely with palms, flowers and rugs.  There will be very little woodwork about the interior, all of the furnishings being in cement and plaster.  There will also be located in the building two fountains, where all who press the button may get a glassful of mineral water.  I am entirely satisfied with the progress of the construction at the exposition and in this connection I may say that from appearances the buildings will be attractive and novel from an architectural standpoint.  I had no <choice><sic><unclear/>da</sic><corr>idea</corr></choice> of the magnitude of the undertaking until I visited the grounds today, and I am more than pleased with the prospects for one of the most complete and interesting expositions that has ever been attempted in this country."</p>

                            <p>The members of the committees appointed at the last meeting of the Council Bluffs Transmississippi Exposition association to solicit funds for the big wigwam, began work yesterday.  Several of the lists were headed with subscriptions of $50 and $100.  The total amount raised in the few hours the committees were at work will approximate about $1,000.  The aim is to raise $5,000 by popular subscription and the sale of the exposition buttons.  The committees will keep at their work until Thursday afternoon and all feel sanguine now of being able to report complete success at the meeting of the association which will be held on that evening.</p>
                            <p>The canvassing of the committees has greatly stimulated the sale of the buttons.  Harle, Haas &amp; Co. reported yesterday that $40 worth of the buttons had been sold at their store.  Secretary Judson yesterday gave the order to the manufacturing firm for the new general county button, which is designed to be sold throughout the county to help on the enterprise.  A sample will be made and submitted to the association before the final order is given for the whole number, 5,000.  No doubt is felt about the final completion of the wigwam and all of the plans for assisting Council Bluffs to get the greatest possible amount of benefit from the exposition.  The reports that will be made at the meeting on Thursday night will be of the most interesting character.</p>

                            <p>Nearly two hours were devoted to reports concerning the progress that is being made for the great educational gathering that is to be held here during the exposition and a general discussion of ways and means to make the event successful.  Each member of the committee as chairman of a subcommittee showed that matters are assuming definite and sweeping form and all of the reports gave a very good general idea of the magnitude the convention will assume.  The committee decided after a thorough discussion of the question, to hold the convention on June 28, 29 and 30, inclusive.  All executive business relative to the meeting will be conducted from rooms Nos. 505 and 508, city hall.</p>

Business Men's association has endorsed the action of the conference of representatives of the five counties of the Arkansas valley, held at La Junta recently, asking the county commissioners of each county to appropriate a small sum to enable a fin exhibit of the resources of the valley to be made at the exposition.  The Pueblo representatives at this meeting were C. B. Schmidt and William B. Ebbert.  Mr. Schmidt resided in Omaha for several years and is well known to all of the older citizens here.  He urged the commissioners of Pueblo county to comply with the request of the conference and also brought the matter before the Business Man's association.  On his motion the association urged the commissioners to make the appropriation in order that the county may be properly represented.</p>

                            <div3>
                            <p>The one topic in exposition circles at this time is the appointment of a director general or some other officer, by whatever title he may be designated, who shall have general supervision over the work of all of the departments and who shall have authority to render a decision on any matter that may be presented.  This subject has been given a great deal of thought by nearly all of the directors since the matter was discussed in the meeting of the directors about two months ago and the opinion has become general that the time has come when decisive action must be taken.  Many of the directors confess to a feeling of delicacy about proceeding in the matter without first having the recommendation of the executive committee, while others say that the matter is of too important a nature to allow the personal feelings of any person to stand in the way of carrying out what they declare is simply a plain business proposition.  Those who have had most to do with the actual working of the present six-headed organization are most emphatic in the declaration that there must be a single head who can guide all the departments.</p>
                            <p>Not a single suggestion has been made by any of the directors of a man to fill the proposed position and there is some difference of opinion as to the exact authority that should be conferred upon the officer, but there is little difference of opinion as to the desirability of centralizing all the work.</p>

                            <p>A canvass of those members of the board of directors who are most accessible in the business district of the city shows the sentiment which prevails in the board.  Few of those who were called upon were not prepared to express an opinion, the majority having very decided opinions on the subject, which they had no hesitancy in expressing.  These opinions follow:</p>

                            <head type="sub">TIME IS AT HAND.</head>
                            <p>John C. Wharton&#8212;If the time has not already arrived when the exposition must have a director general I am satisfied that it will come very, very soon and action should be taken at once.  I fully appreciate the great debt of gratitude the community owes to the men who have so ably managed the enterprise thus far and everybody must admit that they have accomplished wonders, but I am thoroughly convinced that there must be a man placed in general charge of this work who will have authority to say yes or no on every proposition that may be presented.  When I was in California recently I met M. H. De Young, editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, who was at the head of the California Midwinter fair.  He said to me that our plan of organization was faulty and would have to be changed if we wanted to make the exposition a success.  He took the pains to show me why this is so, and I am unwavering in my idea that we must make a change before it is too late.  If it is not done there will be confusion worse confounded in a very short time.  I have some hesitancy about moving in the matter without the full consent of the executive committee and we must insist that those men remain on the committee, but I believe the situation is of such vital importance that the board should act at once.</p>
                            <p>John L. Webster&#8212;I believe that the time will come, if it is not here now, when we must have a director general.  I am convinced that our form of organization is faulty, and it should be remedied before the matter gets too far along.  It might be possible to cure the defect by enlarging the powers of the president, as was suggested some time ago, or it may be necessary to create a new office, but I believe a change will be absolutely necessary in the near future.  As soon as exhibit begin to arrive and the rush of "getting ready" commences, it will be absolutely necessary to have some one with full authority to decide the many points that will be continually arising.</p>

                            <head type="sub">ONE HEAD A NECESSITY.</head>
                            <p>J. H. Millard&#8212;I think, as a plain business proposition, the exposition should have one head.  A man with ability enough to properly manage such an extensive enterprise might command a high salary, but it seems to me such a man is a necessity and should be put in full charge at once.  Such a course would relieve the members of the executive committee of a great responsibility, and I should think <choice><sic>thy</sic><corr>they</corr></choice> would be glad of such a change.  They are all busy men and I think they have accomplished wonders, but the exposition is growing every day and they cannot devote their full time to it to the exclusion of their own business and it would be unreasonable to expect them to do so.  Some one must do so, however, and a man should be employed for that purpose.</p>
                            <p>Frank Murphy&#8212;I have thought all along that we must have a director general, or some officer with full authority to manage the affair.  It is a plain business proposition and ought to be plain to everybody.</p>
                            <p>C. F. Weller&#8212;We ought to have a director general by all means.  There is no room for argument on such a plain business proposition as that.  The thing is getting too big for busy business men to manage it in the limited time the members of the executive committee ought to be expected to take from their own business.  Every member of that committee has a large business of his own to attend to and they are compelled to depend on their subordinates in the exposition.  We ought to have a man on a salary, who will give the thing his whole attention and carry out the instructions of the executive committee.</p>
                            <p>C. F. Manderson &#8212; I believe the time will come when the exposition will have to have a director general.  Whether that time has come now I am not prepared to say.  I think the executive committee is the best judge of that and I shall be in favor of relying upon the committee for a recommendation in the matter before taking action.</p>

                            <p>Thomas L. Kimball&#8212; I have given the matter very little thought recently, and am not prepared to express an opinion.  The general impression among the directors, when the matter was discussed some time ago, seemed to be that building operations should be pushed as fast as possible and that when the time came a director general, or some other officer, should be placed in charge.  Whether that time has arrived, I am not prepared to say.</p>
                            <p>John A. Creighton&#8212;I have given the matter very little thought and have no opinion.  When I hear the discussion on it, I shall be prepared to act as I think the situation requires.</p>
                            <p>John Johnson&#8212;The time has come and a director general should be appointed at once.  I believe the board of directors ought to instruct the executive committee to take the necessary action to carry out that idea.  There should be some man in full charge of all the work and he should be vested with authority to pass upon the hundreds of questions which are coming up all the time.  He ought to be right on the spot at all times so that people will not have to run all over town to find whether they can do this or that.</p>
                            <p>C. M. Wilhelm&#8212;I have given the matter little thought and should want to hear from the executive committee before expressing <unclear/>ems to me that there <unclear/> concern<unclear/></p>
                            <p>G. W. Holdrege&#8212;I believe we should have a director general, but I am not prepared to say whether he should be appointed now or when the exposition opens.</p>
                            <p>One director who declined to allow his name to be used in connection with the statement said he though President Wattles must be perpetrating a huge joke when he said he would favor a director general, or a general superintendent, "when all of the executive committee are in favor of it."  "The president know perfectly well," said this director, "that certain members of the executive committee are unalterably opposed to the idea because they think it reflects on them and they will never favor it, and for the president to say he will favor it when they do is equivalent to saying he is forever opposed to it."</p>

                            <p>The Orchard &amp; Wilhelm Carpet company of this city has decided to place a display of its goods at the exposition and for this purpose has applied for 2,000 feet of space.  The application has been signed and has been presented to the exposition people by W. I. Kierstead, special furniture commissioner.  The head of the Orchard &amp; Wilhelmy company says that he had already placed the orders with eastern manufacturers for the goods and that they will be of exclusive and original designs, equal to any shown at the World's fair.</p>

                            <head type="sub">Hopes to Arrange for His Organization at the Exposition.</head>
                            <p>Ellis Brooks, director and manager of the great band of the Second regiment, Illinois National Guard, was in this city yesterday searching for the musical department of the exposition.  As it was not to be found in Omaha he proceeded to Lincoln.  Mr. Brooks makes his headquarters at Chicago.  He has at his command about 200 musicians.  For national guard purposes he employs 100; for concerts from fifty to 150.  At the Root celebration, held a year ago in Chicago, he conducted a band of 150 and a chorus of 2,000.  At this celebration Jules Lumbard was one of the principal soloists and sang with great success, the band accompanying him.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Brooks is a typical bandmaster.  He has spent his life in the work, for when a boy of 15 he ran away from home and entered the army as performer on the trombone in the Marine band.  1887 he organized his own band in New York City, and has played engagements at nearly all the great expositions since that date.  <unclear/>is direction have appeared Scaich<unclear/> de Vere, Campanini, Materna (<unclear/>tes of all the Wagner singers) and numerous other soloists of world-wide reputation.  Mr. Brooks desires to secure an engagement for his organization during the progress of the exposition.</p>

                            <p>Another hotel for the purpose of catching the exposition trade will open in the northern part of the city.  The large building at Nineteenth and Lake streets has been vacant for seven years.  Now, however, it is to be occupied.  A lease has been signed and men will be set at work at once to remodel and reconstruct the interior.  The building when ready for occupancy will have about thirty sleeping rooms.</p>
