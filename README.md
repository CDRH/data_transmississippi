## About Trans-Mississippi & International Exposition

The far-reaching success of the Chicago World’s Fair in 1893 inspired community leaders in Omaha, Nebraska, to hold their own version of that historic event — the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition. The Expo spread across 184 acres at the northern edge of Omaha, near the Missouri River, from June 1 to October 31, 1898. The Grand Court at the heart of the Expo consisted of majestic but temporary structures and statuary, lush gardens, and a canal with fountains and gondolas — all in stark contrast to the city of Omaha itself, which was still regarded by much of the nation as a frontier town, even as it grew and developed as a major Midwestern business center.

The photographs, newspaper articles, documents, and souvenirs featured in this digital archive — a partnership of the Omaha Public Library and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln — captures the ambitions, controversies, criticisms, cultural attitudes, and technologies of the time, while also depicting the grandeur of the architecture and celebration of the region.
